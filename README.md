# 🧠 COSMO Brain Platform v2.5

> **The World's First Unified Research Browser & Agent IDE.**

COSMO Brain Platform is a high-performance, local-first environment designed to host, query, and extend research artifacts. It is the **Intelligence Player** for the next generation of synthetic researchers—a bridge between deep knowledge retrieval and surgical agentic action.

## 🤯 The Dual-Nature Platform

Most systems separate *reading* from *doing*. COSMO merges them into a single, high-octane **Knowledge Lifecycle**. It consists of two primary environments:

### 1. 🌐 The Brain Browser (The Landing Page)
Your entry point into the ecosystem. This page manages your entire local collection of research.
*   **📚 Brain Library**: Stable, versioned knowledge artifacts. These are **distilled snapshots** of research, packaged into portable `.brain` files ready for production or sharing.
*   **🛠️ Research Workspaces**: Active staging areas. This is where **raw research runs** live, containing high-entropy data like agent thought-streams, failed hypotheses, and telemetry.
*   **🚀 One-Click Launch**: Instantly fire up any brain or workspace into the unified **Brain Studio**.

### 2. 🏗️ The Brain Studio (The Workspace)
A professional, multi-mode environment where you transition between understanding and execution.
*   **💬 Research Mode (The Scholar)**: Deep interrogation of a Brain's long-term memory. Search thousands of nodes, find evidence, and synthesize complex topics with GPT-5.2 powered reasoning.
*   **🤖 Agent IDE Mode (The Architect)**: Your operational cockpit. Collaborative document editing, code generation, and terminal command execution.
    *   **Surgical Edits**: The AI Assistant performs precise, localized edits directly on your local disk—no more copy-pasting code blocks.
    *   **Human-in-the-Loop Gating**: Review and approve every proposed file change or terminal command in a dedicated edit queue before execution.
    *   **Integrated Workflow**: Create new research artifacts, run simulations, or manage your project files without leaving the Studio.
*   **🔭 Explore Mode (The Navigator)**: A high-dimensional visualizer for the Brain's Knowledge Graph.
    *   **Interactive Visualization**: Navigate thousands of research nodes and their complex relationships in a real-time D3-powered force-directed graph.
    *   **Advanced Filtering**: Slice through the data using concept search, node-type filters (Analyst, Curiosity, Critic), and spatial clustering.
    *   **Node Deep-Dives**: Click any node to instantly view its underlying content, metadata, and cross-references.
    *   **Visual Analysis**: Adjust node size and edge opacity dynamically to reveal the structural "skeleton" of the knowledge field.
*   **📖 Docs Mode**: Integrated access to platform guides and project documentation.

## ⚡ The Knowledge Lifecycle: Find it. Build it.
The true "insanity" of COSMO is the workflow. You discover a breakthrough or evidence in **Research Mode**, switch to the **Agent IDE**, and have the AI architect immediately help you draft the paper, write the simulation code, or execute the next phase of the project based on that specific discovery.

---

## 🚀 Core Capabilities
*   **Multi-Model Intelligence**: Effortlessly switch between Claude 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Grok for specialized reasoning.
*   **Portable Knowledge**: Entire fields of study are packaged into versioned, shareable `.brain` snapshots.
*   **Local-First Privacy**: Your research data stays on your disk. No telemetry is uploaded; the platform operates strictly in your trusted local environment.
*   **Terminal Gating**: Human-in-the-loop review for all AI-proposed system commands and surgical edits.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup the environment
npm run setup

# 2. Add your API Keys
# Edit the .env file with your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.

# 3. Launch the Platform
npm start
```
Access the Browser at `http://localhost:3398`.

## 🔭 Future: Create Your Own Brains
The Brain Studio is the "Intelligence Player"—but the full **COSMO Research System** allows you to be the creator. Trigger custom automated research runs across any domain and generate your own specialized `.brain` files.
