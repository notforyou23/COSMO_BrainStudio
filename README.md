# 🧠 COSMO Brain Platform v2.5

> **The World's First Unified Research Browser & Agent IDE.**

COSMO Brain Studio is a high-performance, local-first environment that bridges the gap between **deep knowledge retrieval** and **surgical agentic action**. It is the "Intelligence Player" designed for the next generation of researchers, architects, and knowledge workers.

## 🤯 This is Insanity: The Dual-Nature Platform

Most tools force you to choose between reading or doing. COSMO gives you both in a seamless, unified lifecycle.

### 🔬 Part 1: The Brain Browser (Deep Research)
*   **Query the Unconscious**: Deep interrogation of a Brain's long-term memory.
*   **Evidence Synthesis**: Don't just ask questions—find the exact nodes, evidence, and failed hypotheses from thousands of research artifacts.
*   **Global Context**: Search across high-dimensional Knowledge Graphs powered by the latest frontier models.

### 🛠️ Part 2: The Agent IDE (Intelligent Action)
*   **Surgical Execution**: This isn't just a chatbot. It's a full-blown IDE where the AI can propose precise edits, manage files, and write production-grade code.
*   **Terminal Integration**: Give the AI the power to execute system commands, run simulations, and verify math—all with human-in-the-loop gating.
*   **Local-First Workspace**: A professional, dark-mode workspace built for high-entropy research extension.

## 🔄 The Knowledge Lifecycle
The true "magic" happens in the transition. You find a breakthrough in the **Research Browser**, switch to the **Agent IDE**, and immediately have the AI architect assist you in building a document, script, or paper based on that discovery.

## ⚡ Run Your Own Brains
The Brain Studio is the "Intelligence Player"—but you can also be the creator. With access to the full **COSMO Research System**, you can:
*   **Trigger Automated Brain Runs**: Launch synthetic research agents across any domain.
*   **Build Custom Knowledge Artifacts**: Create your own versioned `.brain` files from proprietary data or specialized fields.
*   **Frontier Power**: Tap into the core research engine that generated the Art, Music, and Physics brains included here.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities
*   **Multi-Model Intelligence**: Effortless switching between Claude 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Grok for specialized reasoning.
*   **Portable Knowledge**: Research is packaged into `.brain` files—versioned, shareable snapshots of an entire field of knowledge.
*   **Absolute Privacy**: Your research data stays on your local disk. We only send the minimum required context to LLM providers.

## 🛠️ Quick Start
