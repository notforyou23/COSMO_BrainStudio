# 🧠 COSMO Brain Platform

> **The "MP3" for AI Knowledge.**
> Just as the MP3 decoupled music from the recording studio, the `.brain` format decouples intelligence from the research engine. **Research in COSMO. Review in the Run. Crystallize into a Brain.**

COSMO Brain Platform is a portable, high-performance environment designed to host, query, and extend research artifacts. It is the **Intelligence Player** for the next generation of synthetic researchers, built on the vision of **Knowledge Crystallization**.

## 🔬 The Philosophy: Liquid vs. Crystallized

Think of a COSMO research run as a high-end recording session. It is full of raw data, intermediate tracks, and technical noise. The `.brain` is the finished, portable "song" that the world can actually hear.

1.  **🌊 Liquid Research (Staging)**: Raw, high-entropy output from an active COSMO research run. This includes every agent thought, failed calculation, and raw telemetry. It's for development and monitoring.
2.  **💎 Crystallized Intelligence (Releases)**: Distilled, immutable knowledge artifacts. By "Crystallizing" a run, you strip away the noise and package only the high-density Knowledge Graph, curated insights, and final deliverables into a portable **.brain** file.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Brain Browser**: A visual dashboard to manage your library of crystallized intelligence and liquid staging runs.
*   **✨ Crystallization Engine**: One-click distillation of raw research into portable, shareable artifacts.
*   **Knowledge Query**: Deep interrogation of knowledge graphs powered by GPT-5.2.
*   **AI IDE**: Collaborative document editing and research extension in a Cursor-style environment.

## 📦 Included Showcase Brains

This repository includes several pre-crystallized research artifacts:
*   **Art and Music**: A dense knowledge graph (5,000+ edges) covering the history of human expression.
*   **Mathematics**: Advanced modeling across algebra, calculus, and probability.
*   **Physics**: Comprehensive research into fundamental physical dynamics.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup the environment
./setup.sh

# 2. Add your API Keys
# Edit the generated .env file

# 3. Launch the Platform
npm start
```
Browser available at: `http://localhost:3398`

## 🔒 Security & Safety

Built for **Trusted Local Environments**:
*   **Local-First**: No research data is uploaded; the IDE operates strictly on your local disk.
*   **Isolated Spawning**: Each Brain Studio instance runs in its own process.
*   **Terminal Gating**: The AI can execute terminal commands to assist in research. Always review proposed actions in the "AI Edits" panel.
