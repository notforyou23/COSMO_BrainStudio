# 🧠 COSMO Brain Platform

> **Research in COSMO. Review in the Workspace. Publish to the Library.**

COSMO Brain Platform is a portable, high-performance environment designed to host, query, and extend research artifacts. It is the **Intelligence Player** for the next generation of synthetic researchers, built on the vision of a **Universal Knowledge Lifecycle**.

## 🔬 The Philosophy: Workspace vs. Library

Just as GitHub separates your local code from your stable releases, this platform separates the *process* of research from the *product* of knowledge.

1.  **🛠️ Research Workspace (Staging)**: This is where the raw research happens. It contains the high-entropy output of active COSMO runs—including agent thoughts, failed hypotheses, and raw telemetry. It is for monitoring and steering.
2.  **📚 Brain Library (Releases)**: When research reaches a milestone, you "Publish" it. This distilllation process strips away the technical noise and packages only the high-density Knowledge Graph and final deliverables into a portable, versioned **.brain** file.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Brain Browser**: A visual dashboard to manage your stable Brain Library and active Research Workspaces.
*   **🚀 One-Click Publishing**: Instantly distill raw research into portable, shareable knowledge artifacts.
*   **Knowledge Query**: Deep interrogation of knowledge graphs powered by GPT-5.2.
*   **AI-Augmented IDE**: Collaborative document editing and research extension in a professional web environment.

## 📦 Included Showcase Brains

This repository includes several pre-crystallized research artifacts in the `brains/` directory:
*   **Art and Music**: A dense knowledge graph (5,000+ edges) covering the history of human expression and aesthetics.
*   **Mathematics**: Advanced modeling across algebra, calculus, geometry, and probability.
*   **Physics**: Comprehensive research into fundamental physical laws and dynamics.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup the environment
./setup.sh

# 2. Add your API Keys
# Edit the generated .env file

# 3. Launch the Platform
npm start
```
Browser available at: `http://localhost:3398`

## 🔒 Security & Safety

Built for **Trusted Local Environments**:
*   **Local-First**: No research data is uploaded; the IDE operates strictly on your local disk.
*   **Isolated Spawning**: Each Brain Studio instance runs in its own process.
*   **Terminal Gating**: The AI can execute terminal commands to assist in research. Always review proposed actions in the "AI Edits" panel.
