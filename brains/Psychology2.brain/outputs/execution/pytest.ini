markers =
    integration: Integration tests that may invoke subprocesses and touch the network; run with -m integration
    unit: Fast, hermetic unit tests (default selection excludes integration when using -m "not integration")
    slow: Potentially slow tests (may be combined with integration)
    network: Tests that require network access (often overlaps with integration)
