You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement/finish `verify_build_artifacts.py` to assert required files exist and are non-empty (e.g., `runtime/_build/reports/*.json`, `runtime/_build/tables/*.csv`, `runtime/_build/figures/*`), then wire it into the default runner/CI so every run produces auditable artifacts or fails loudly.
Project: generated_script_1766733982506 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Purpose: CI workflow that runs the build and then runs verify_build_artifacts.py to ensure every CI run produces auditable non-empty artifacts or fails.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- verify_build_artifacts.py: Command-line verification tool that asserts required build artifact file patterns exist under runtime/_build and that each matched file is non-empty, failing with clear diagnostics and a non-zero exit code.
- scripts/run_default.py: Default local runner that executes the normal build pipeline and then invokes verify_build_artifacts.py so missing/empty artifacts cause a loud failure.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: CI workflow that runs the build and then runs verify_build_artifacts.py to ensure every CI run produces auditable non-empty artifacts or fails.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('.github/workflows/ci.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:.github/workflows/ci.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside .github/workflows/ci.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
