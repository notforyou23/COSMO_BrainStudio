You are planning a python script implementation for the following mission:
Investigate and fix the repeated 'Container lost' failure that prevents CodeExecutionAgents from running any tests (seen in multiple attempts where testing aborted at 0/50). Add a lightweight preflight smoke test that prints environment diagnostics (Python version, working dir, repo root, disk space, write permissions) and exits nonzero with actionable error messages if conditions are not met.

Relevant context:
- [CONSOLIDATED] Repeated code-validation runs are failing before any tests execute because the execution container is being lost, indicating

Explicit requirements:
- docker

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
