You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Publish task_taxonomy_codebook_v0.1 + annotation schema in /outputs, then create 5–10 example annotations and run the validator in CI (or a scripted smoke test) to prove the categories/constraints work.
Project: 5–10 example annotations and run the validator in CI (or a (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/annotation_schema_v0.1.json
- Purpose: Defines the JSON Schema for task annotations (v0.1) including required fields, enums, and cross-field constraints where possible.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/task_taxonomy_codebook_v0.1.json: Publishes the v0.1 task taxonomy codebook as a machine-readable JSON artifact in the outputs directory.
- outputs/example_annotations_v0.1.jsonl: Provides 5–10 example annotations in JSONL format that exercise categories and schema constraints for smoke testing.
- src/validate_annotations.py: Implements a CLI validator that loads the schema, validates JSON/JSONL annotations, and applies additional logical constraints not expressible in pure JSON Schema.
- tests/test_annotation_validator_smoke.py: Runs a smoke test that validates the bundled example annotations against the schema and custom rules to prove constraints work in CI.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines the JSON Schema for task annotations (v0.1) including required fields, enums, and cross-field constraints where possible.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/annotation_schema_v0.1.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/annotation_schema_v0.1.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/annotation_schema_v0.1.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
