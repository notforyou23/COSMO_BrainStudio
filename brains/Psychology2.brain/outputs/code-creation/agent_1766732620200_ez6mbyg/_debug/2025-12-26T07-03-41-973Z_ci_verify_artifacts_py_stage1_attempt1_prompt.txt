You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add minimal CI configuration that runs the one-command runner and then runs the artifact verification step, failing if runtime/_build artifacts are missing/empty and uploading runtime/_build as a CI artifact.
Project: generated_configuration_1766732620467 (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: ci/verify_artifacts.py
- Purpose: Python verification script that fails CI if runtime/_build is missing or contains no files (optionally ignoring common junk files) and prints a concise inventory for debugging.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: GitHub Actions CI workflow that checks out the repo, sets up Python, runs the one-command runner, verifies runtime/_build is present and non-empty, and uploads runtime/_build as a build artifact.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Python verification script that fails CI if runtime/_build is missing or contains no files (optionally ignoring common junk files) and prints a concise inventory for debugging.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('ci/verify_artifacts.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:ci/verify_artifacts.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside ci/verify_artifacts.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
