You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a minimal “artifact creation success” gate: create /outputs with README + folder structure + versioned CHANGELOG, then add an automated check (or manual checklist) that confirms files exist and are non-empty before ending a cycle.
Project: /outputs with README + folder structure + versioned CHANGELOG, then add an automated check (or manual checklist) that confirms files exist and are non-empty before ending a cycle. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/logs/.gitkeep
- Purpose: Ensures the logs subdirectory exists for run metadata and gate reports as part of the required outputs folder structure.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/artifact_gate.py: Implements the minimal artifact creation success gate by creating the /outputs structure (README and versioned CHANGELOG) and verifying required files exist and are non-empty before cycle completion.
- src/__init__.py: Marks the src directory as a package to support imports for the artifact gate module and CLI entrypoint.
- scripts/run_artifact_gate.py: Provides a runnable CLI script that invokes artifact creation and the automated existence/non-empty checks with clear exit codes for CI or manual runs.
- tests/test_artifact_gate.py: End-to-end tests that validate folder/file creation, non-empty content enforcement, changelog versioning behavior, and failure modes when artifacts are missing or empty.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Ensures the logs subdirectory exists for run metadata and gate reports as part of the required outputs folder structure.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/logs/.gitkeep')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/logs/.gitkeep')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/logs/.gitkeep.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
