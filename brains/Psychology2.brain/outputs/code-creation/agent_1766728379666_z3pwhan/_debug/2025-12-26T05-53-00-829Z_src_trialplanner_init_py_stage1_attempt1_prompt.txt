Mission summary: Produce a detailed, mechanism-oriented plan for multi-wave randomized intervention trials that links within-child cognitive growth (executive function and processing speed) to reasoning and real-world decisions via fine-grained social support operationalizations (ZPD: type, timing, fading). The plan should specify experimental arms (nudge/choice-architecture, targeted debiasing, sleep-restoration), measurement schedules for proximal mediators and distal outcomes, causal-chain tests (mediation/moderation), and logistics needed to compare transfer and durability within the same cohorts.
Project: generated_script_1766728379916 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/trialplanner/__init__.py
- Purpose: Package initializer exporting the public API for building, validating, and rendering multi-wave trial plans.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- README.md: Project overview and quickstart explaining how to generate multi-wave randomized intervention trial plans linking cognitive growth, ZPD social support operationalizations, and decision outcomes.
- pyproject.toml: Python package configuration with pinned dependencies and entry points for running the trial-plan generator CLI.
- src/trialplanner/schema.py: Pydantic data models defining experimental arms, ZPD support parameters (type/timing/fading), measurement schedules, mediators/outcomes, and causal tests for transfer and durability.
- src/trialplanner/catalogs.py: Curated catalogs of intervention components, cognitive tasks, proximal mediator measures, distal outcomes, and example ZPD operationalizations used to assemble mechanism-oriented plans.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Package initializer exporting the public API for building, validating, and rendering multi-wave trial plans.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/trialplanner/__init__.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/trialplanner/__init__.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/trialplanner/__init__.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
