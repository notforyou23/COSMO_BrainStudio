The plan should specify experimental arms (nudge/choice-architecture, targeted debiasing, sleep-restoration), measurement schedules for proximal mediators and distal outcomes, causal-chain tests (mediation/moderation), and logistics needed to compare transfer and durability within the same cohorts.",
  "missionSuccessCriteria": [
    "Specify at least three fully-specified experimental arms (intervention content, dose, delivery modality) that map to nudge/choice-architecture, targeted debiasing training, and sleep-restoration protocols.",
    "Define a multi-wave measurement schedule (minimum 4 waves) that includes: baseline, immediate post-intervention, short-term follow-up, long-term follow-up, with explicit cognitive mediators (executive-function subtests, processing-speed metrics), ZPD social-support manipulations (type, timing, fading), and at least two policy-relevant distal behavioral endpoints.",
    "Provide a clear analytic strategy to test causal chains and durability: pre-registered mediation/moderation models, sample-size / power heuristics for mediation effects, handling of attrition and missingness, and criteria for establishing broad vs. narrow transfer.",
    "Deliver a concise implementation checklist (recruitment, randomization, fidelity monitoring, measurement instruments, ethical considerations) and a prioritized set of next steps for piloting within 1–2 cohorts."
