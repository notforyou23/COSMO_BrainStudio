You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Specify an ID schema (regex + uniqueness rules), implement an ID mismatch checker that reads the extraction CSV + taxonomy JSONL + prereg fields, and include a small demo dataset that intentionally fails to prove the checker catches the error.
Project: generated_script_1766727087423 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: data/demo/taxonomy.jsonl
- Purpose: Small demo taxonomy JSONL with deliberate ID conflicts and missing IDs relative to the extraction CSV for mismatch detection.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/id_schema.py: Defines the canonical ID schema (compiled regex patterns, normalization rules, and uniqueness constraints) used across extraction CSV, taxonomy JSONL, and prereg fields.
- src/loaders.py: Implements robust readers/parsers for the extraction CSV, taxonomy JSONL, and prereg metadata (CSV/JSON) into a unified in-memory representation with validation-friendly field names.
- src/id_mismatch_checker.py: Implements the ID mismatch checker that validates schema conformance, detects duplicates, and cross-checks referential integrity across extraction/taxonomy/prereg sources with actionable error reports.
- src/demo_run.py: Provides a runnable CLI demo that loads the included demo dataset and intentionally fails to demonstrate the checker catching ID schema and cross-file mismatch errors.

Key requirements:
- examples

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Small demo taxonomy JSONL with deliberate ID conflicts and missing IDs relative to the extraction CSV for mismatch detection.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('data/demo/taxonomy.jsonl')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:data/demo/taxonomy.jsonl')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside data/demo/taxonomy.jsonl.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
