You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Diagnose and fix the 'container lost after testing 0/50 files' execution failure by adding environment checks + path diagnostics to the existing gate/validator scripts (artifact_gate.py and related tooling) and re-run to confirm stability; write a troubleshooting report to runtime/_build/reports/container_stability.md.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766732702075 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: gate/artifact_gate.py
- Purpose: Enhanced artifact gate/validator script with preflight environment checks, Docker availability validation, and path diagnostics to prevent container-loss failures.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- gate/env_diagnostics.py: Shared diagnostics module that collects and formats environment, Docker runtime, filesystem, and PATH/PYTHONPATH details for gate scripts to log and include in reports.
- gate/docker_healthcheck.py: Utility module that runs lightweight Docker health checks (daemon reachable, image pull/run sanity, resource/permission hints) and emits actionable troubleshooting output.
- gate/path_probe.py: Path probing helpers that validate expected project directories/files, resolve symlinks, detect missing mounts, and print canonical paths used by validators.
- runtime/_build/reports/container_stability.md: Troubleshooting report documenting the 'container lost after testing 0/50 files' failure, added checks/diagnostics, reproduction notes, and post-fix stability confirmation steps.

Key requirements:
- docker

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Enhanced artifact gate/validator script with preflight environment checks, Docker availability validation, and path diagnostics to prevent container-loss failures.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('gate/artifact_gate.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:gate/artifact_gate.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside gate/artifact_gate.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
