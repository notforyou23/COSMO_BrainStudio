You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Reproduce the failure, then add preflight checks (working directory, permissions, mount points, expected paths, glob results) to `artifact_gate.py`/validator scripts; ensure diagnostics are written to `_build/<run_id>/logs/` before exit.
Project: generated_script_1766737439994 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: tools/validators/preflight.py
- Purpose: Implement a reusable preflight validation module that collects environment and filesystem diagnostics (pwd, uid/gid, umask, mounts, path existence, readability/writability, glob expansions) and writes structured logs under _build/<run_id>/logs/.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- tools/artifact_gate.py: Update the artifact gate entrypoint to reproduce the failure mode, add comprehensive preflight checks (cwd, permissions, mounts, expected paths, glob results), and ensure all diagnostics are written to _build/<run_id>/logs/ before any exit.
- tools/validators/__init__.py: Provide a package initializer for validator scripts to share preflight utilities and consistent logging behavior.
- tools/validators/artifacts_validator.py: Harden the artifacts validator to call preflight checks before doing work, emit actionable diagnostics to _build/<run_id>/logs/, and exit with clear error codes when expected artifacts or paths are missing.
- tools/support/run_id.py: Add a small helper to resolve or generate a stable run_id used to route all logs into _build/<run_id>/logs/ consistently across scripts.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Implement a reusable preflight validation module that collects environment and filesystem diagnostics (pwd, uid/gid, umask, mounts, path existence, readability/writability, glob expansions) and writes structured logs under _build/<run_id>/logs/.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tools/validators/preflight.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tools/validators/preflight.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tools/validators/preflight.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
