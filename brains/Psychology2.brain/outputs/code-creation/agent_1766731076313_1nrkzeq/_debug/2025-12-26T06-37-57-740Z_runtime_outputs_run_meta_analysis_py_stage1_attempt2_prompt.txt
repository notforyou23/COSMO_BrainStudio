You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create and run a minimal meta-analysis starter kit in runtime/outputs (CSV extraction templates + a runnable analysis skeleton) that produces at least one numeric summary table (e.g., pooled estimate on toy data) saved to runtime/outputs/_build/ (addresses audit gap: 0 analysis outputs).
Project: and run a minimal meta-analysis starter kit in runtime/outputs (CSV extraction templates + a runnable analysis skeleton) that produces at least one numeric summary table (e.g., pooled estimate on toy data) saved to runtime/outputs/_build/ (addresses audit gap: 0 analysis outputs). (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: runtime/outputs/run_meta_analysis.py
- Purpose: Runnable analysis skeleton script that loads the toy or user-filled CSV, runs pooling, and saves numeric summary outputs to runtime/outputs/_build/.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/meta_starter/__init__.py: Package initializer for the minimal meta-analysis starter kit used by the runnable analysis skeleton.
- src/meta_starter/io.py: Implements CSV template/schema handling and robust loading/validation of extracted study-level effect size data.
- src/meta_starter/meta.py: Provides core meta-analysis computations (toy fixed-effect and random-effects pooling) and produces numeric summary tables.
- src/meta_starter/report.py: Builds and writes analysis outputs (summary CSV tables) into runtime/outputs/_build/ in a reproducible structure.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Runnable analysis skeleton script that loads the toy or user-filled CSV, runs pooling, and saves numeric summary outputs to runtime/outputs/_build/.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('runtime/outputs/run_meta_analysis.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:runtime/outputs/run_meta_analysis.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside runtime/outputs/run_meta_analysis.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
