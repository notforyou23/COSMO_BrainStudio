You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Run the artifact gate and taxonomy validator against current /outputs artifacts; save the console output and a structured JSON log (tool version, inputs, outputs, exit code) to /outputs/logs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766726690727 (json cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: src/json_cli_tool/__init__.py
- Purpose: Package initializer exposing tool version and public interfaces for the artifact gate and taxonomy validator runner CLI.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/json_cli_tool/version.py: Defines the canonical tool version string and helpers to include it in structured logs.
- src/json_cli_tool/logging_utils.py: Implements run directory creation under outputs/logs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS and utilities to write console and JSON structured logs atomically.
- src/json_cli_tool/process_runner.py: Provides a safe subprocess execution wrapper that captures stdout/stderr, exit code, timing, and command metadata for logging.
- src/json_cli_tool/cli.py: Implements the JSON CLI entrypoint that runs artifact gate and taxonomy validator against outputs/artifacts and writes console output plus structured JSON log to outputs/logs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Package initializer exposing tool version and public interfaces for the artifact gate and taxonomy validator runner CLI.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/json_cli_tool/__init__.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/json_cli_tool/__init__.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/json_cli_tool/__init__.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
