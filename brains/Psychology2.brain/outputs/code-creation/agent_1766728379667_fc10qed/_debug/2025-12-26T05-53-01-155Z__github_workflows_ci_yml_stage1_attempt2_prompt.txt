You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a minimal CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) that installs deps, runs the validator + demo runner, asserts expected outputs exist (reports/figures), and uploads runtime/_build as CI artifacts; make missing outputs a hard failure.
Project: minimal CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) that installs deps, runs the validator + demo runner, asserts expected outputs exist (reports/figures), and uploads runtime/_build as CI artifacts; make missing outputs a hard failure. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Purpose: GitHub Actions workflow that sets up Python, installs dependencies, runs the validator and demo runner, hard-fails on missing expected outputs (reports/figures), and uploads runtime/_build as CI artifacts.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/ci_run.py: Python CI entrypoint that runs the repo's validator and demo runner commands, verifies required output paths exist, and exits nonzero with actionable diagnostics when outputs are missing.
- scripts/ci_expectations.json: Declarative list of required CI output files/directories (e.g., reports and figures) used by the CI runner to enforce hard failures when artifacts are missing.
- scripts/README_CI_EXAMPLES.md: Examples documenting how to run the CI checks locally (validator + demo runner + output assertions) and how to customize expected outputs.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: GitHub Actions workflow that sets up Python, installs dependencies, runs the validator and demo runner, hard-fails on missing expected outputs (reports/figures), and uploads runtime/_build as CI artifacts.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('.github/workflows/ci.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:.github/workflows/ci.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside .github/workflows/ci.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
