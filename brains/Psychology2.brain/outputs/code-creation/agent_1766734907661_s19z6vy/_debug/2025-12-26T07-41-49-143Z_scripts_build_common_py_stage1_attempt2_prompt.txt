You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Consolidate duplicate runner + verification scripts into one canonical pair by selecting the best existing build_runner.py and verify_artifacts.py from agent output directories, placing them in a single stable repo location, and updating imports/paths so the runner always writes to runtime/_build/.
Project: generated_script_1766734907945 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/_build_common.py
- Purpose: Shared utilities used by the canonical runner and verifier for path resolution, subprocess execution, logging, and report persistence to runtime/_build/.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- tools/consolidate_build_scripts.py: CLI tool that scans agent output directories for duplicate build_runner.py and verify_artifacts.py, selects the best candidates via heuristics, normalizes paths/imports so the runner always writes to runtime/_build/, and installs the canonical pair into a stable repo location.
- scripts/build_runner.py: Canonical build runner that executes the standardized build workflow and always writes artifacts and logs under runtime/_build/ regardless of invocation directory.
- scripts/verify_artifacts.py: Canonical artifact verification script that runs the required validation tools against the current artifacts under runtime/_build/ and persists raw command outputs and a summarized report.
- docs/build_script_consolidation.md: Documentation describing how consolidation works, how candidate scripts are scored/selected, where the canonical scripts live, and the invariant that all outputs go to runtime/_build/.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Shared utilities used by the canonical runner and verifier for path resolution, subprocess execution, logging, and report persistence to runtime/_build/.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/_build_common.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/_build_common.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/_build_common.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
