You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define a canonical StudyID/EffectID convention; add ID columns/fields to CSV + JSONL + prereg template; implement a checker that reports missing/duplicate/mismatched IDs; include a small demo dataset that intentionally triggers a mismatch and documents expected failure behavior.
Project: generated_configuration_1766728380044 (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: src/ids/convention.py
- Purpose: Defines the canonical StudyID/EffectID format, validation regexes, and helpers to normalize/compare IDs across files.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/ids/checker.py: Implements a CLI-capable checker that loads CSV, JSONL, and prereg templates to report missing, duplicate, and mismatched StudyID/EffectID values with actionable error messages.
- src/ids/io.py: Provides robust readers/writers for CSV and JSONL and a parser for prereg templates to extract and validate ID fields consistently.
- src/ids/reporting.py: Builds structured check results and renders human-readable and machine-readable summaries of ID integrity issues.
- src/demo/run_demo.py: Runs the checker against the included demo dataset to intentionally trigger an ID mismatch and prints the expected failure behavior.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines the canonical StudyID/EffectID format, validation regexes, and helpers to normalize/compare IDs across files.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/ids/convention.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/ids/convention.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/ids/convention.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
