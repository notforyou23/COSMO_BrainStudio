You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Build a lightweight citation/primary-source access MVP prototype saved to /outputs (e.g., script that takes a DOI list and attempts to locate open full-text via known repositories/APIs, logging success/failure) to support goal_1.
Project: generated_api_server_1766724060001 (python api_server)

Target file details:
- Path: src/cli.py
- Purpose: Command-line entrypoint to run the same DOI discovery pipeline without the server and save results to outputs/ for MVP batch use.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/api_server.py: FastAPI server exposing endpoints to submit DOI lists, run open-full-text discovery against multiple providers, and return structured results with logs.
- src/discovery.py: Implements provider-ordered DOI-to-fulltext discovery (Unpaywall, OpenAlex, Crossref links, PubMed/PMC) with normalized result objects and retry/backoff.
- src/providers.py: Contains provider clients and fetch logic for Unpaywall, OpenAlex, Crossref, and NCBI E-utilities/PMC with robust error handling and rate limiting.
- src/models.py: Defines Pydantic models for requests/responses, per-DOI outcomes, provenance metadata, and export-ready run summaries.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Command-line entrypoint to run the same DOI discovery pipeline without the server and save results to outputs/ for MVP batch use.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/cli.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/cli.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/cli.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
