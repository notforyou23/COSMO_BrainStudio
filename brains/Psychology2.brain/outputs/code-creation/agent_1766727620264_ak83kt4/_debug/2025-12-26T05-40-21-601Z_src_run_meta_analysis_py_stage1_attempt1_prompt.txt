You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a minimal toy dataset (e.g., 5–10 rows) and an analysis script/notebook that (a) loads the CSV, (b) computes a simple pooled effect (fixed/random), (c) saves a forest plot and summary table into /outputs, and (d) writes a run log with timestamps and file paths.
Project: generated_script_1766727620507 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/run_meta_analysis.py
- Purpose: Standalone Python script that loads the toy CSV, computes fixed/random pooled effects, writes a summary table, saves a forest plot into outputs, and appends a timestamped run log with produced file paths.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- notebooks/meta_analysis_demo.ipynb: Runnable notebook version of the same workflow (load CSV, compute pooled effect, generate forest plot and summary table, and write a run log) for interactive demonstration.
- src/meta_utils.py: Utility module implementing effect-size calculations, inverse-variance pooling (fixed/random), heterogeneity statistics, and plotting helpers used by both the script and notebook.
- outputs/.gitkeep: Placeholder file to ensure the outputs directory exists in version control for generated plots, tables, and logs.
- README.md: Project documentation explaining how to run the script/notebook, required inputs, and where outputs (forest plot, summary table, run log) are written.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Standalone Python script that loads the toy CSV, computes fixed/random pooled effects, writes a summary table, saves a forest plot into outputs, and appends a timestamped run log with produced file paths.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/run_meta_analysis.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/run_meta_analysis.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/run_meta_analysis.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
