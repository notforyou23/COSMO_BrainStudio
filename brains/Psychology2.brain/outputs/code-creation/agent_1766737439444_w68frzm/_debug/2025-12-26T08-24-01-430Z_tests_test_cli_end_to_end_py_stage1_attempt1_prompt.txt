Mission summary: Design a rigorous, implementable plan for developing and validating standardized workflows, metadata checklists, and lightweight tooling for primary-source scholarship in psychology. The plan should specify steps for community engagement, technical feature set (edition/translation provenance, variant pagination, public-domain citations), empirical evaluation methods (surveys and audit studies), and integration/test milestones.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766737439700 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_cli_end_to_end.py
- Purpose: End-to-end tests exercising key CLI workflows: init, checklist generation, metadata validation, and report/citation outputs.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- pyproject.toml: Project configuration defining package metadata, dependencies, and the psyprim console-script entry point.
- README.md: Documentation describing the mission-aligned workflow plan, community engagement steps, metadata checklists, evaluation methods, and CLI usage examples.
- src/psyprim/__init__.py: Package initializer exporting the library version and top-level public interfaces.
- src/psyprim/cli.py: Complete Typer-based CLI implementing workflow commands for initializing projects, generating checklists, validating metadata, and producing citation/provenance reports.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: End-to-end tests exercising key CLI workflows: init, checklist generation, metadata validation, and report/citation outputs.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_cli_end_to_end.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_cli_end_to_end.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_cli_end_to_end.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
