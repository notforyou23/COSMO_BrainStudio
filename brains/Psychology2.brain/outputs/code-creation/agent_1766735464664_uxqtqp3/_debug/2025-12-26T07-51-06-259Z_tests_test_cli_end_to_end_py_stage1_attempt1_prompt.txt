You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a small curated DOI test set (covering edge cases like redirects/paywalls/multiple editions), run api_server.py end-to-end, and save normalized outputs (JSON + CSV + logs) with explicit provenance fields (landing URL, accessed timestamp, parsing method, failure reason codes).
Project: small curated DOI test set (covering edge cases like redirects/paywalls/multiple editions), run api_server.py end-to-end, and save normalized outputs (JSON + CSV + logs) with explicit provenance fields (landing URL, accessed timestamp, parsing method, failure reason codes). (python api_server)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_cli_end_to_end.py
- Purpose: End-to-end test that spins up the API server, executes the runner over the DOI test set, and asserts outputs include required provenance fields and valid failure codes.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/api_server.py: Implements the HTTP API server with end-to-end DOI resolution, normalization, and explicit provenance fields (landing_url, accessed_at, parsing_method, failure_reason_code) plus structured logging.
- src/doi_pipeline.py: Provides the core DOI processing pipeline (resolve redirects/paywalls, fetch/parse metadata, normalize fields, emit JSON records) with deterministic failure reason codes.
- src/provenance.py: Defines provenance and failure code schemas/enums and helpers to consistently populate accessed timestamps, landing URLs, parsing methods, and error categorization.
- src/exporters.py: Writes normalized outputs to JSONL/JSON and CSV with stable column order and embeds provenance fields while also saving per-run logs to disk.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: End-to-end test that spins up the API server, executes the runner over the DOI test set, and asserts outputs include required provenance fields and valid failure codes.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_cli_end_to_end.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_cli_end_to_end.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_cli_end_to_end.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
