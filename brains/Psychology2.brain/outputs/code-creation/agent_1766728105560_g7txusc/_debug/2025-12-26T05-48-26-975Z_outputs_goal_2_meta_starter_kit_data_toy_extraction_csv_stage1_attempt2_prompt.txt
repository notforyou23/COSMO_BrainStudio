You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a toy CSV + minimal analysis script that (a) loads the CSV, (b) computes a placeholder pooled estimate, (c) saves a forest plot and summary table into runtime/_build/reports/, and (d) writes an execution log; ensure the runner fails if files are missing.
Project: toy CSV + minimal analysis (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/goal_2_meta_starter_kit/data/toy_extraction.csv
- Purpose: Toy meta-analysis extraction CSV with a minimal set of rows/columns needed for the script to compute per-study effects and a pooled estimate.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/toy_meta_analysis.py: Standalone Python script that loads the toy extraction CSV, computes a placeholder pooled estimate, writes a forest plot and summary table into runtime/_build/reports/, logs execution, and exits nonzero if required inputs/outputs are missing.
- runtime/_build/reports/.gitkeep: Placeholder file to ensure the reports output directory exists in the repository for saving plots, tables, and logs.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Toy meta-analysis extraction CSV with a minimal set of rows/columns needed for the script to compute per-study effects and a pooled estimate.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/goal_2_meta_starter_kit/data/toy_extraction.csv')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/goal_2_meta_starter_kit/data/toy_extraction.csv')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/goal_2_meta_starter_kit/data/toy_extraction.csv.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
