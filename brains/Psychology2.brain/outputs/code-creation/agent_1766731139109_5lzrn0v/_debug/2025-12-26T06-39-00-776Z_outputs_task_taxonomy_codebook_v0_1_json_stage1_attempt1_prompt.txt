You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Consolidate agent-produced outputs currently living in agent-specific directories (e.g., code-creation/.../outputs/task_taxonomy_codebook_v0.1.json and related schema/example files) into the single canonical /outputs scaffold, update CHANGELOG, and ensure the artifact gate checks these exact canonical paths.
Project: generated_script_1766731139344 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/task_taxonomy_codebook_v0.1.json
- Purpose: Canonical consolidated task taxonomy codebook artifact JSON produced by agents, placed under the single outputs/ scaffold for gating and downstream use.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/consolidate_outputs.py: Python script that finds agent-specific output artifacts (e.g., code-creation/**/outputs/*), consolidates them into the canonical outputs/ scaffold, and optionally updates CHANGELOG.md while preserving existing canonical files deterministically.
- scripts/check_artifact_gate.py: Standalone artifact gate checker that validates the required canonical output paths exist and match expectations defined in config/artifact_gate_paths.json, exiting nonzero on any mismatch.
- config/artifact_gate_paths.json: Canonical allowlist of required artifact file paths under outputs/ used by the artifact gate checker to enforce exact locations.
- outputs/task_taxonomy_codebook_schema_v0.1.json: JSON Schema for outputs/task_taxonomy_codebook_v0.1.json to enable validation and ensure consistent structure for artifact gate and consumers.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Canonical consolidated task taxonomy codebook artifact JSON produced by agents, placed under the single outputs/ scaffold for gating and downstream use.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/task_taxonomy_codebook_v0.1.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/task_taxonomy_codebook_v0.1.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/task_taxonomy_codebook_v0.1.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
