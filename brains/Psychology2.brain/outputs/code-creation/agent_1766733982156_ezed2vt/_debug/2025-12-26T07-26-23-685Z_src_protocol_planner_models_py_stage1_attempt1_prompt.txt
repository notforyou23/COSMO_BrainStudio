Mission summary: Design a detailed, implementable plan to produce community-endorsed protocols (checklists, metadata schemas) and lightweight software/plugins that detect and annotate edition/translation provenance, variant pagination/paragraph markers, and public-domain repository citations for primary-source psychology scholarship. The plan should specify stakeholder engagement, technical requirements, validation study designs (surveys + audit studies), and a phased rollout with measurable adoption and evaluation milestones.
Project: generated_script_1766733982408 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/protocol_planner/models.py
- Purpose: Typed dataclass models for stakeholders, protocol components (checklists, schemas), plugin/software requirements, study designs (survey + audit), and rollout milestones with measurable metrics.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- README.md: Project overview and quickstart describing how the Python CLI generates community protocol drafts, technical requirements, validation study designs, and phased rollout milestones for provenance-aware primary-source psychology scholarship.
- pyproject.toml: Python project configuration defining dependencies, entry points for the CLI, and tooling settings for reproducible execution.
- src/protocol_planner/__init__.py: Package initializer exposing the public CLI entry function and version metadata.
- src/protocol_planner/cli.py: Command-line interface that collects inputs (scope, corpora, stakeholders, repositories) and writes a complete implementable plan plus artifacts into an output directory.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Typed dataclass models for stakeholders, protocol components (checklists, schemas), plugin/software requirements, study designs (survey + audit), and rollout milestones with measurable metrics.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/protocol_planner/models.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/protocol_planner/models.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/protocol_planner/models.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
