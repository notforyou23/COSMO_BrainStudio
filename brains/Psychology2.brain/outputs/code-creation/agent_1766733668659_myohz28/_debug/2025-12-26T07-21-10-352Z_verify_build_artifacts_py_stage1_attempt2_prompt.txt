You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement/finish `verify_build_artifacts.py` to assert required files exist and are non-empty (e.g., `runtime/_build/reports/*.json`, `runtime/_build/tables/*.csv`, `runtime/_build/figures/*`), then wire it into the default runner/CI so every run produces auditable artifacts or fails loudly.
Project: generated_script_1766733668864 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: verify_build_artifacts.py
- Purpose: Command-line verifier that asserts required build artifact files exist under runtime/_build (reports JSON, tables CSV, figures) and are non-empty, failing with a clear error report when expectations are not met.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: CI workflow updated to run verify_build_artifacts.py after the build step so the pipeline fails loudly if auditable artifacts are missing or empty.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Command-line verifier that asserts required build artifact files exist under runtime/_build (reports JSON, tables CSV, figures) and are non-empty, failing with a clear error report when expectations are not met.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('verify_build_artifacts.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:verify_build_artifacts.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside verify_build_artifacts.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
