You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Design a concrete, testable plan for developing and validating community-endorsed workflows and lightweight software/plugins that detect edition/translation provenance, variant page/paragraph numbers, and public-domain repository citations for primary-source scholarship in psychology. Produce a prioritized task breakdown (specs for checklists, metadata schema, UI/UX requirements, automated detection heuristics, and an empirical evaluation protocol including survey and audit-study designs) that can be handed to developers, archivists, and journal partners.
Project: generated_script_1766730610082 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/psyprov/uiux_requirements.py
- Purpose: Machine-readable UI/UX requirement specs for plugins and submission systems including forms, defaults, error states, and reviewer-facing displays.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- README.md: Project overview and quickstart describing mission goals, supported workflows, installation, and how to run the planner and validation protocols.
- pyproject.toml: Python package configuration defining dependencies, entry points, tooling, and test settings for the workflow/provenance planning toolkit.
- src/psyprov/__init__.py: Package initializer exporting public interfaces for schemas, heuristics, and the plan generator.
- src/psyprov/schemas.py: Pydantic data models and JSON Schema exporters for metadata fields covering edition/translation provenance, page/paragraph variants, and repository citations.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Machine-readable UI/UX requirement specs for plugins and submission systems including forms, defaults, error states, and reviewer-facing displays.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/psyprov/uiux_requirements.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/psyprov/uiux_requirements.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/psyprov/uiux_requirements.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
