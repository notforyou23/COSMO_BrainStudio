You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Design a focused implementation-and-evaluation plan for standardized primary-source workflows and lightweight tooling in the history of psychology. Specify the protocol elements (checklists, metadata schema), the minimal viable software/plugin features (provenance flags, variant numbering, repository citation linking), and an empirical evaluation design (surveys + audit studies) that will measure effects on citation accuracy, reproducibility, and researcher effort.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766725784745 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: src/psyprim/schema.py
- Purpose: Metadata schema (JSON Schema + helpers) for primary-source records, citations, repository links, variants, and provenance flags with validation utilities.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- pyproject.toml: Project configuration defining the package, dependencies, console-script entry point, and tool settings for linting/testing.
- README.md: User-facing documentation describing the standardized primary-source workflow, protocol elements (checklists + metadata), and CLI usage examples.
- src/psyprim/__init__.py: Package initializer exposing the library version and high-level public interfaces used by the CLI.
- src/psyprim/cli.py: Complete Python CLI tool implementing protocol checklists, metadata validation, provenance flags, variant numbering, repository citation linking, and evaluation export commands.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Metadata schema (JSON Schema + helpers) for primary-source records, citations, repository links, variants, and provenance flags with validation utilities.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/psyprim/schema.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/psyprim/schema.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/psyprim/schema.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
