You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Build a script in /outputs/tools that takes a DOI list, queries a small set of sources (e.g., Unpaywall/Crossref + repository heuristics), records retrieval attempts, and outputs structured logs (JSON/CSV) including source, URL, license/PD status when available, and failure reasons.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766728379944 (json cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/tools/doi_retriever_sources.py
- Purpose: Source adapters implementing Unpaywall and Crossref querying plus repository/landing-page heuristics and normalization into a common attempt/result schema.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/tools/doi_retriever.py: CLI script that reads a DOI list, queries Unpaywall and Crossref plus repository URL heuristics, records each retrieval attempt with outcomes, and writes structured JSONL/CSV logs including source, URL, license/PD status when available, and failure reasons.
- outputs/tools/doi_retriever_http.py: HTTP client utilities for rate-limited requests, retries, timeouts, user-agent/email handling, and consistent error normalization for external APIs.
- outputs/tools/doi_retriever_schema.py: Shared dataclasses and serialization helpers defining the structured log schema for attempts, results, license fields, and failure codes.
- outputs/tools/doi_retriever_utils.py: Utility functions for DOI parsing/normalization, CSV/JSONL writing, safe filename handling, and lightweight URL/host heuristics.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Source adapters implementing Unpaywall and Crossref querying plus repository/landing-page heuristics and normalization into a common attempt/result schema.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/tools/doi_retriever_sources.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/tools/doi_retriever_sources.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/tools/doi_retriever_sources.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
