You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create /outputs/README.md (artifact rules), /outputs/CHANGELOG.md (versioned entries per cycle), and core folders (e.g., /outputs/meta_analysis/, /outputs/taxonomy/, /outputs/tooling/) and commit/update changelog immediately.
Project: /outputs/README.md (artifact rules), /outputs/CHANGELOG.md (versioned entries per cycle), and core folders (e.g., /outputs/meta_analysis/, /outputs/taxonomy/, /outputs/tooling/) and commit/update changelog immediately. (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/meta_analysis/README.md
- Purpose: Defines what belongs in /outputs/meta_analysis, expected file formats, and minimal metadata requirements for generated analyses.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/README.md: Documents the /outputs artifact contract including folder purpose, naming conventions, artifact rules, and how the CLI tool should write and update outputs safely.
- outputs/CHANGELOG.md: Maintains versioned, cycle-based changelog entries for the /outputs artifacts and structure, updated immediately when outputs are created or modified.
- outputs/taxonomy/README.md: Defines what belongs in /outputs/taxonomy, expected taxonomy schema conventions, and how updates should be recorded in the changelog.
- outputs/tooling/README.md: Describes tooling-related output artifacts, how they are generated by the CLI, and the standards for reproducibility and traceability.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines what belongs in /outputs/meta_analysis, expected file formats, and minimal metadata requirements for generated analyses.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/meta_analysis/README.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/meta_analysis/README.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/meta_analysis/README.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
