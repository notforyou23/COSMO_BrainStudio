You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement the one-command build runner that sequentially runs: artifact gate, taxonomy validation, and the toy meta-analysis demo; enforce that all outputs/logs land in `_build/` and the process exits non-zero on any missing/empty artifact.
Project: generated_script_1766737439938 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/build_utils.py
- Purpose: Provides shared utilities for running subprocess steps with tee-style logging to _build/, ensuring directories exist, and validating required artifacts are present and non-empty.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/build_runner.py: Implements a one-command Python build runner that sequentially runs artifact gate, taxonomy validation, and the toy meta-analysis demo while forcing all logs/outputs into _build/ and exiting non-zero on any missing/empty artifact.
- scripts/build.py: CLI entrypoint script that invokes the build runner with sensible defaults and supports local usage and CI execution.
- scripts/_examples/run_build_examples.py: Contains runnable examples demonstrating successful and failing builds, showing where outputs/logs appear under _build/ and how non-zero exits occur on missing/empty artifacts.
- tests/test_build_runner.py: End-to-end tests that create temporary dummy artifacts and stub commands to verify sequential execution, _build/ output enforcement, and non-zero exit behavior for missing/empty artifacts.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Key requirements:
- examples

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provides shared utilities for running subprocess steps with tee-style logging to _build/, ensuring directories exist, and validating required artifacts are present and non-empty.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/build_utils.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/build_utils.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/build_utils.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
