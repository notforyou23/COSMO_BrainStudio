Mission summary: Implement a baseline retrieve-then-verify pipeline with explicit 'must-cite' constraints (quote+URL/DOI+span mapping) and wire it into the borderline QA evaluation harness to compare false-accept rates vs. self-confidence prompting.
Project: generated_script_1766732620395 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: pyproject.toml
- Purpose: Project configuration defining dependencies, entry points, and tooling for the retrieve-then-verify baseline and evaluation harness integration.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/borderline_qa/__init__.py: Package initializer for the borderline QA baseline pipeline and evaluation utilities.
- src/borderline_qa/citations.py: Implements must-cite data structures and validators enforcing quote+URL/DOI+span mappings with deterministic checks and normalization.
- src/borderline_qa/retriever.py: Baseline retriever module that fetches candidate sources (web and/or local corpus) and returns ranked passages with stable IDs and provenance metadata.
- src/borderline_qa/verifier.py: Verifier module that checks model answers against retrieved passages and enforces explicit must-cite constraints including exact-quote and span alignment.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Project configuration defining dependencies, entry points, and tooling for the retrieve-then-verify baseline and evaluation harness integration.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('pyproject.toml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:pyproject.toml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside pyproject.toml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
