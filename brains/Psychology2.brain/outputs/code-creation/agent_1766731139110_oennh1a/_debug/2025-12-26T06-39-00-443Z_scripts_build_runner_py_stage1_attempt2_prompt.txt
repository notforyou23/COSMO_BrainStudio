Mission summary: Create an automated 'one-command' build runner that sequentially executes: artifact gate, taxonomy validation, and the toy meta-analysis demo; ensure it writes all logs/outputs into _build/ and fails fast on errors.
Project: an automated 'one-command' build runner that sequentially executes: artifact gate, taxonomy validation, and the toy meta-analysis demo; ensure it writes all logs/outputs into _build/ and fails fast on errors. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/build_runner.py
- Purpose: One-command build runner CLI that sequentially executes artifact gate, taxonomy validation, and the toy meta-analysis demo, writing all logs/outputs into _build/ and failing fast on any error.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/build_steps.py: Step implementations and helpers for invoking the artifact gate, taxonomy validation, and meta-analysis demo as subprocesses with consistent logging, output capture, and _build/ directory management.
- scripts/logging_utils.py: Structured logging and output-capture utilities that tee subprocess stdout/stderr to both console and _build/ log files with timestamps and step prefixes.
- scripts/path_utils.py: Path and filesystem utilities to create, clean, and resolve project-relative build output locations under _build/ in a cross-platform manner.
- scripts/README_build_runner.md: Documentation for running the one-command build runner, including expected prerequisites, command examples, outputs in _build/, and troubleshooting.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: One-command build runner CLI that sequentially executes artifact gate, taxonomy validation, and the toy meta-analysis demo, writing all logs/outputs into _build/ and failing fast on any error.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/build_runner.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/build_runner.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/build_runner.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
