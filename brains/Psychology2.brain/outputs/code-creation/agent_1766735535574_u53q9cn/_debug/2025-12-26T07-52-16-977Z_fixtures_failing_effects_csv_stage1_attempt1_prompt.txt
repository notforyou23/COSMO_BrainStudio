You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define an ID convention (e.g., study_id, effect_id) used identically in CSV and JSONL, implement a mismatch-checker script, and include a demo fixture that intentionally fails (plus a passing fixture) with clear error messages.
Project: generated_script_1766735535722 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: fixtures/failing/effects.csv
- Purpose: Failing demo CSV fixture intentionally containing an ID-format violation and an ID pair not present in the JSONL to trigger mismatch errors.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/id_convention.py: Defines the canonical ID convention (study_id and effect_id formats), validation helpers, and shared constants used identically across CSV and JSONL.
- src/mismatch_checker.py: Implements a CLI script that loads CSV and JSONL, validates IDs, checks cross-file mismatches, and emits clear actionable error messages with exit codes.
- fixtures/passing/effects.csv: Passing demo CSV fixture containing study_id and effect_id columns that fully match the JSONL fixture under the shared ID convention.
- fixtures/passing/effects.jsonl: Passing demo JSONL fixture with records whose study_id and effect_id match the passing CSV fixture exactly under the shared ID convention.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Key requirements:
- examples

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Failing demo CSV fixture intentionally containing an ID-format violation and an ID pair not present in the JSONL to trigger mismatch errors.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('fixtures/failing/effects.csv')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:fixtures/failing/effects.csv')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside fixtures/failing/effects.csv.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
