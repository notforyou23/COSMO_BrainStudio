You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add a toy dataset CSV aligned to the extraction template; implement a one-command run that outputs (1) pooled estimate table (CSV/JSON) and (2) one plot (PNG/PDF) into a deterministic folder (e.g., runtime/_build/) with a run log.
Project: generated_configuration_1766735664709 (json configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: src/io_utils.py
- Purpose: Utilities for deterministic output folder creation, atomic file writes, and structured run logging with captured parameters and environment info.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- config/run_config.json: JSON configuration defining input CSV path, output build directory, estimator options, and plot/export settings for the one-command run.
- data/toy_extraction.csv: Toy meta-analysis extraction CSV aligned to the project extraction template for deterministic end-to-end runs.
- src/run_pipeline.py: Single entry-point script that loads JSON config, runs the meta-analysis, writes pooled estimates (CSV/JSON), generates one plot (PNG/PDF), and emits a run log into runtime/_build/.
- src/meta_analysis.py: Core meta-analysis implementation that reads the extraction CSV, computes fixed/random effects pooled estimates, and returns tidy result tables for export.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Utilities for deterministic output folder creation, atomic file writes, and structured run logging with captured parameters and environment info.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/io_utils.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/io_utils.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/io_utils.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
