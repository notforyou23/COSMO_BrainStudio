Mission summary: Create a tiny annotation JSONL fixture (valid + intentionally invalid rows), run the validator, and save a pass/fail summary plus per-record errors into runtime/_build/reports/taxonomy_validation.json; wire into the runner and CI.
Project: tiny annotation JSONL fixture (valid + intentionally invalid rows), run the validator, and save a pass/fail summary plus per-record errors into runtime/_build/reports/taxonomy_validation.json; wire into the runner and CI. (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/run_taxonomy_validation.js
- Purpose: CLI runner that loads the JSONL fixture, invokes the validator, and writes the summary and per-record errors to runtime/_build/reports/taxonomy_validation.json with a nonzero exit code on failure.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- tests/fixtures/taxonomy/annotations_fixture.jsonl: Tiny JSONL annotation fixture containing a mix of valid rows and intentionally invalid rows to exercise taxonomy validation paths.
- src/taxonomy/validate_annotations.js: Implements a JSONL annotation validator that checks each record against the taxonomy/schema rules and returns per-record errors plus a pass/fail summary.
- runtime/_build/reports/.gitkeep: Keeps the reports output directory in version control so CI and local runs can reliably write taxonomy_validation.json.
- package.json: Adds a runnable script entry (e.g., taxonomy:validate) that executes scripts/run_taxonomy_validation.js and can be invoked by the test runner and CI.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: CLI runner that loads the JSONL fixture, invokes the validator, and writes the summary and per-record errors to runtime/_build/reports/taxonomy_validation.json with a nonzero exit code on failure.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/run_taxonomy_validation.js')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/run_taxonomy_validation.js')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/run_taxonomy_validation.js.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
