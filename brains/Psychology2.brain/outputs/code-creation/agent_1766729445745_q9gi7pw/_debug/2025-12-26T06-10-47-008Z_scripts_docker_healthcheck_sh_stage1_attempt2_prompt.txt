You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add a preflight diagnostics step that runs before any pipeline step (disk/memory check, basic container health command, minimal smoke test) and implement retry + structured failure logging that captures the last N lines of stdout/stderr and environment stats into runtime/_build/logs/container_health.jsonl.
Project: generated_script_1766729445981 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/docker_healthcheck.sh
- Purpose: Implements a basic container health command suitable for Docker/CI usage (e.g., checking essential binaries, filesystem writability, and optional service endpoints) to be invoked by preflight diagnostics.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/preflight_diagnostics.py: Runs preflight diagnostics (disk/memory checks, container health command, minimal smoke test) with retries and writes structured JSONL failure logs including last N stdout/stderr lines and environment stats to runtime/_build/logs/container_health.jsonl.
- scripts/pipeline_runner.py: Wraps existing CI/CD pipeline steps to ensure the preflight diagnostics run before any step and to apply consistent retry and structured logging behavior on step failures.
- scripts/_build_logging.py: Provides shared utilities for capturing stdout/stderr tail, collecting environment/system stats, and emitting JSONL records under runtime/_build/logs for diagnostic and failure reporting.
- scripts/smoke_test.py: Defines a minimal, fast smoke test executed during preflight to verify Python runtime, key imports, and basic filesystem/network sanity without requiring full pipeline execution.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Implements a basic container health command suitable for Docker/CI usage (e.g., checking essential binaries, filesystem writability, and optional service endpoints) to be invoked by preflight diagnostics.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/docker_healthcheck.sh')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/docker_healthcheck.sh')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/docker_healthcheck.sh.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
