You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a verifier policy that requires (a) retrieved source passages, (b) quote-level alignment to each decomposed claim, and (c) deterministic constraint checks; evaluate against a held-out set with calibrated thresholds and log per-claim evidence failures for audit.
Project: generated_script_1766736347815 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/verifier_policy/audit_log.py
- Purpose: Structured audit logging that records per-claim evidence failures, constraint violations, and provenance for downstream review.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- pyproject.toml: Project metadata and pinned runtime dependencies for retrieval, NLP, and evaluation tooling.
- README.md: Usage-focused documentation describing the retrieve-then-verify pipeline, data formats, calibration, and audit logs.
- src/verifier_policy/__init__.py: Package initializer exposing the primary pipeline entry points and version information.
- src/verifier_policy/schemas.py: Typed dataclasses/Pydantic-style models defining inputs/outputs for claims, passages, quotes, decisions, and audit events.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Structured audit logging that records per-claim evidence failures, constraint violations, and provenance for downstream review.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/verifier_policy/audit_log.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/verifier_policy/audit_log.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/verifier_policy/audit_log.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
