You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add a minimal GitHub Actions workflow that (1) installs deps, (2) runs the one-command runner (gate → validator → meta-analysis demo), (3) uploads runtime/_build as an artifact, and (4) hard-fails if required output paths are missing.
Project: generated_script_1766730610111 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/ci_verify_outputs.py
- Purpose: Python helper script invoked by CI to hard-fail the job when required output files/directories (including runtime/_build) are missing after the runner completes.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: GitHub Actions CI workflow that sets up Python, installs dependencies, runs the one-command runner (gate→validator→meta-analysis demo), verifies required outputs exist, and uploads runtime/_build as an artifact.
- examples/ci_github_actions_minimal.md: Example documentation showing how the minimal GitHub Actions workflow runs the one-command runner and how to reproduce the same steps locally, including output verification expectations.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Python helper script invoked by CI to hard-fail the job when required output files/directories (including runtime/_build) are missing after the runner completes.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/ci_verify_outputs.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/ci_verify_outputs.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/ci_verify_outputs.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
