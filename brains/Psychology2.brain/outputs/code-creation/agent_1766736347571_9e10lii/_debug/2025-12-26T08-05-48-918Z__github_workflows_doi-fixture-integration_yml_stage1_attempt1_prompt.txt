You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a minimal integration test that runs api_server.py (or the CLI) on a fixed DOI fixture list, saves results to /outputs/tools or runtime/_build (JSON/CSV), and documents expected success/failure cases; wire the run into CI once stable.
Project: minimal integration test that runs api_server.py (or the CLI) on a fixed DOI fixture list, saves results to /outputs/tools or runtime/_build (JSON/CSV), and documents expected success/failure cases; wire the run into CI once stable. (python api_server)

Target file details:
- Path: .github/workflows/doi-fixture-integration.yml
- Purpose: Adds a CI workflow that executes the DOI fixture integration test and uploads the generated JSON/CSV artifacts, initially as non-blocking until marked stable.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- tests/fixtures/doi_fixture_list.json: Defines a small, fixed list of DOI test fixtures with metadata (expected success/failure and notes) used by the integration test.
- tests/integration/test_doi_fixture_integration.py: Runs api_server.py (or the CLI) against the fixed DOI fixture list, writes JSON/CSV outputs to runtime/_build or outputs/tools, and asserts expected success/failure behavior per fixture.
- tests/support/run_api_server_fixture.py: Provides a reusable subprocess-based runner that starts api_server.py (or calls the CLI), feeds the DOI fixtures, collects results, and persists artifacts deterministically for CI.
- tests/support/artifact_paths.py: Centralizes output directory selection and naming (preferring outputs/tools else runtime/_build) to keep artifact paths consistent across local runs and CI.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Adds a CI workflow that executes the DOI fixture integration test and uploads the generated JSON/CSV artifacts, initially as non-blocking until marked stable.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('.github/workflows/doi-fixture-integration.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:.github/workflows/doi-fixture-integration.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside .github/workflows/doi-fixture-integration.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
