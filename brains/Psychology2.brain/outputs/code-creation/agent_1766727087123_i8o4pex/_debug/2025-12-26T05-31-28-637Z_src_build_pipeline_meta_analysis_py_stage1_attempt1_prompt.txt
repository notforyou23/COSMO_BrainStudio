You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define a single entrypoint (e.g., `make all` or `python -m build`) that (1) validates schemas, (2) runs a placeholder meta-analysis pipeline, and (3) writes a dated build log + checksum manifest into `/outputs/build_logs/`.
Project: generated_script_1766727087386 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/build_pipeline/meta_analysis.py
- Purpose: Placeholder meta-analysis pipeline module that reads validated inputs, performs a minimal deterministic analysis, and writes outputs for logging.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- pyproject.toml: Project configuration defining build metadata, dependencies, and a console-script entrypoint to run the full pipeline.
- src/build_pipeline/__init__.py: Package initializer exposing the public API and version for the build pipeline package.
- src/build_pipeline/cli.py: Single entrypoint CLI that orchestrates schema validation, placeholder meta-analysis, and writing dated build logs plus checksum manifest to outputs/build_logs.
- src/build_pipeline/schema_validation.py: Schema validation module that loads schemas and validates input data files, returning structured results and failing fast on errors.

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Placeholder meta-analysis pipeline module that reads validated inputs, performs a minimal deterministic analysis, and writes outputs for logging.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/build_pipeline/meta_analysis.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/build_pipeline/meta_analysis.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/build_pipeline/meta_analysis.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
