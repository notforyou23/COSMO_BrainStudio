You are planning a json script implementation for the following mission:
Add a lightweight artifact verifier that asserts existence + non-emptiness (file size > 0) for runtime/_build/logs/run.log, runtime/_build/manifest.json, runtime/_build/validation/taxonomy_report.json, and runtime/_build/meta_analysis/summary_table.csv and forest_plot.png, and write runtime/_build/verification_report.json. This addresses the audit gap of 0 test/execution results by turning outputs into a pass/fail contract.

Relevant context:

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
