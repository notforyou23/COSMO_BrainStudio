You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a verification script (e.g., src/verify_build_artifacts.py) that asserts: at least one non-empty JSON in runtime/_build/reports, one non-empty CSV in runtime/_build/tables, and one image file in runtime/_build/figures; integrate it into CI after the runner step.
Project: generated_script_1766730610179 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/verify_build_artifacts.py
- Purpose: Standalone verification script that fails the build unless runtime/_build/reports contains at least one non-empty JSON file, runtime/_build/tables contains at least one non-empty CSV file, and runtime/_build/figures contains at least one image file (png/jpg/jpeg/svg/gif/webp/tif/tiff/bmp).
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- .github/workflows/verify-build-artifacts.yml: GitHub Actions workflow that runs the project runner step to generate artifacts and then executes src/verify_build_artifacts.py to enforce build artifact presence in CI.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Standalone verification script that fails the build unless runtime/_build/reports contains at least one non-empty JSON file, runtime/_build/tables contains at least one non-empty CSV file, and runtime/_build/figures contains at least one image file (png/jpg/jpeg/svg/gif/webp/tif/tiff/bmp).
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/verify_build_artifacts.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/verify_build_artifacts.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/verify_build_artifacts.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
