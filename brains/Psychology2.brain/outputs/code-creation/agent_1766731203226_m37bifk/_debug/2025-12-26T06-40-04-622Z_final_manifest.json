  "missionDescription": "Stabilize the execution environment to prevent repeats of 'container lost' by pinning dependencies and adding a minimal reproducibility manifest (requirements/environment file) plus a tiny smoke-test that confirms the environment before running validators/meta-analysis. Store the manifest alongside the runner and record versions in the JSON run logs.",
  "missionSuccessCriteria": [
    "Complete strategic task identified by Meta-Coordinator or escalated by Strategic Tracker",
    "A prior CodeExecutionAgent run aborted due to environment/container instability. Without stabilization, further validation and demo runs will remain unreliable and non-auditable."
