You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Promote/consolidate agent-created deliverables into a canonical runtime/outputs scaffold: create runtime/outputs/README.md and runtime/outputs/CHANGELOG.md, and copy in the prereg template + taxonomy JSON/schema/example annotation so the project has a single source of truth.
Project: runtime/outputs/README.md and runtime/outputs/CHANGELOG.md, and copy in the prereg template + taxonomy JSON/schema/example annotation so the project has a single source of truth. (json configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: runtime/outputs/taxonomy/example_annotation.json
- Purpose: Provides a concrete example annotation instance demonstrating correct use of the taxonomy and serving as a reference for producers/consumers.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- runtime/outputs/README.md: Defines the canonical runtime/outputs scaffold, its purpose, directory conventions, and the single-source-of-truth artifacts maintained there.
- runtime/outputs/CHANGELOG.md: Tracks versioned changes to runtime/outputs artifacts (templates, taxonomy, schemas, and examples) to preserve provenance and auditability.
- runtime/outputs/templates/prereg_template.md: Provides the canonical preregistration template used across the project as the authoritative source for prereg deliverables.
- runtime/outputs/taxonomy/taxonomy.json: Stores the canonical taxonomy definition in JSON to standardize labels and structure used by agent-created deliverables.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provides a concrete example annotation instance demonstrating correct use of the taxonomy and serving as a reference for producers/consumers.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('runtime/outputs/taxonomy/example_annotation.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:runtime/outputs/taxonomy/example_annotation.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside runtime/outputs/taxonomy/example_annotation.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
