You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define an atomic-claim schema + labeling rubric (supported/contradicted/insufficient) and build a small curated reference corpus + gold annotations to serve as the first 'borderline-confidence' dataset slice.
Project: generated_script_1766738872102 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: data/reference_corpus.jsonl
- Purpose: Contains the curated reference documents/passages with stable IDs and citation metadata used for grounding claim labels.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- README.md: Documents the atomic-claim schema, labeling rubric, dataset format, and how to run the curation/validation scripts end-to-end.
- pyproject.toml: Defines the Python package, dependencies, console scripts, formatting/linting tools, and test configuration.
- src/atomic_claims/__init__.py: Provides the package entry point and exports the public schema and dataset utilities.
- src/atomic_claims/schema.py: Implements the atomic-claim data model with machine-readable fields (subject, predicate, scope, provenance requirements) plus JSON serialization and validation.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Contains the curated reference documents/passages with stable IDs and citation metadata used for grounding claim labels.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('data/reference_corpus.jsonl')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:data/reference_corpus.jsonl')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside data/reference_corpus.jsonl.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
