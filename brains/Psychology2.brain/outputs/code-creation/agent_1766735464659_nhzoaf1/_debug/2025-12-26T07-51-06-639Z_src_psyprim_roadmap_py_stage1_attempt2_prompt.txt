Mission summary: Design a rigorous validation and adoption roadmap for the standardized workflows and lightweight tooling for primary-source scholarship in psychology. Produce an empirically grounded plan that specifies experimental designs (surveys, audit studies), metrics for citation accuracy/reproducibility/usability, sampling frames (journals, archives, researcher populations), and data collection/analysis methods to test the effect of tool adoption.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766735464912 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: src/psyprim/roadmap.py
- Purpose: Core logic to assemble empirically grounded roadmap plans, including default templates for surveys, audit studies, and adoption experiments tailored to psychology scholarship.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- pyproject.toml: Project configuration defining build system, dependencies, console entrypoint, and tooling metadata for the psyprim CLI.
- README.md: User-facing documentation describing the mission, CLI commands, example workflows, and how to generate the validation/adoption roadmap outputs.
- src/psyprim/__init__.py: Package initializer exposing version and top-level interfaces for the psyprim toolkit.
- src/psyprim/cli.py: Complete CLI implementation that generates a rigorous validation and adoption roadmap with selectable study designs, metrics, sampling frames, and analysis plans.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Core logic to assemble empirically grounded roadmap plans, including default templates for surveys, audit studies, and adoption experiments tailored to psychology scholarship.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/psyprim/roadmap.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/psyprim/roadmap.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/psyprim/roadmap.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
