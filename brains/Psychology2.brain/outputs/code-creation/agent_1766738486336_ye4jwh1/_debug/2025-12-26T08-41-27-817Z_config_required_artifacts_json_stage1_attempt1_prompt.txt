You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement/finish verify_artifacts.py to emit runtime/_build/manifest.json (paths, sizes, hashes, timestamps, schema versions) and make the build fail if required artifacts are absent or empty; add this to CI and the one-command runner.
Project: generated_script_1766738486541 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: config/required_artifacts.json
- Purpose: Defines the required build artifacts (glob/path patterns and minimum size rules) that verify_artifacts.py enforces across local runs and CI.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/verify_artifacts.py: Implements artifact verification and manifest generation (runtime/_build/manifest.json) including paths, sizes, hashes, timestamps, schema versions, and hard-fails the build if required artifacts are missing or empty.
- scripts/one_command_runner.py: Updates the one-command runner to invoke artifact verification after the build so failures propagate and the manifest is always emitted.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: Updates CI to run artifact verification and upload runtime/_build/manifest.json as a build artifact while failing when required artifacts are absent or empty.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines the required build artifacts (glob/path patterns and minimum size rules) that verify_artifacts.py enforces across local runs and CI.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('config/required_artifacts.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:config/required_artifacts.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside config/required_artifacts.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
