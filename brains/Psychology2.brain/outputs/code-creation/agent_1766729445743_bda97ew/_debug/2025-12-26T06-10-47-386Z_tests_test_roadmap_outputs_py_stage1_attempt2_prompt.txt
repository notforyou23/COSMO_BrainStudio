Mission summary: Design a concrete, testable plan for creating and validating standardized workflows, metadata checklists, and lightweight detection tools for primary-source scholarship in psychology. Produce an actionable roadmap that specifies study designs (surveys + audit studies), measurement instruments, required data sources and repositories, key technical detection features to implement (edition/translation provenance, variant pagination, repository citations), and an assignment of specialist-agent tasks for implementation and evaluation.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766729445976 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_roadmap_outputs.py
- Purpose: Pytest suite ensuring generated roadmap, checklist, and instrument outputs are structurally valid, deterministic, and include required mission elements.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- pyproject.toml: Project configuration defining package metadata, dependencies, CLI entry point, formatting, and test tooling.
- README.md: User-facing documentation describing the mission, installation, CLI usage, workflow outputs, and validation approach (survey + audit study).
- src/psyprim/__init__.py: Package initializer exposing the public version and high-level APIs for roadmap generation and detection.
- src/psyprim/cli.py: Complete argparse-based CLI implementing commands to generate standardized workflows, metadata checklists, survey/audit instruments, and to run lightweight primary-source citation detection on text files.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pytest suite ensuring generated roadmap, checklist, and instrument outputs are structurally valid, deterministic, and include required mission elements.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_roadmap_outputs.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_roadmap_outputs.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_roadmap_outputs.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
