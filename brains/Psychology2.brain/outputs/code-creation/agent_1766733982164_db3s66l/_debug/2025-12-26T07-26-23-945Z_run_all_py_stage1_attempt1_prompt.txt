You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Build a `run_all.py` (or Makefile/task runner) that executes in a fixed order: (1) taxonomy smoke-test, (2) toy demo run, (3) artifact gate; ensure it writes logs to `runtime/_build/logs/` and exits non-zero on any failure.
Project: generated_script_1766733982373 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: run_all.py
- Purpose: Task runner script that executes (1) taxonomy smoke-test, (2) toy demo run, (3) artifact gate in a fixed order, streams output to console, writes per-step logs under runtime/_build/logs/, and exits non-zero on the first failure.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Task runner script that executes (1) taxonomy smoke-test, (2) toy demo run, (3) artifact gate in a fixed order, streams output to console, writes per-step logs under runtime/_build/logs/, and exits non-zero on the first failure.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('run_all.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:run_all.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside run_all.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
