You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a deterministic artifact verification step that asserts runtime/_build contains non-empty required outputs (at minimum: one JSON report in runtime/_build/reports, one CSV table in runtime/_build/tables, one PNG/PDF figure in runtime/_build/figures, and one log in runtime/_build/logs). The verifier should fail with a clear missing-file list and be runnable as a single command.
Project: deterministic artifact verification step that asserts runtime/_build contains non-empty required outputs (at minimum: one JSON report in runtime/_build/reports, one CSV table in runtime/_build/tables, one PNG/PDF figure in runtime/_build/figures, and one log in runtime/_build/logs). The verifier should fail with a clear missing-file list and be runnable as a single command. (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/verify_build_artifacts.json
- Purpose: Configuration describing required artifact directories, accepted extensions, and minimum non-empty constraints for the build artifact verifier.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/verify_build_artifacts.py: Single-command deterministic verifier that asserts runtime/_build contains non-empty required outputs (JSON report, CSV table, PNG/PDF figure, and log) and fails with a clear missing-file list.
- scripts/_artifact_verify_utils.py: Shared helper utilities for filesystem scanning, size/non-emptiness checks, deterministic ordering, and human-friendly error reporting used by the verifier.
- Makefile: Convenience targets including a single-command entrypoint to run the artifact verification step consistently across environments.
- README_verify_artifacts.md: Documentation for running the artifact verifier, interpreting failures, and expected runtime/_build folder structure.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Configuration describing required artifact directories, accepted extensions, and minimum non-empty constraints for the build artifact verifier.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/verify_build_artifacts.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/verify_build_artifacts.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/verify_build_artifacts.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
