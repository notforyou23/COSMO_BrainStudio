You are planning a json script implementation for the following mission:
Create a deterministic artifact verification step that asserts runtime/_build contains non-empty required outputs (at minimum: one JSON report in runtime/_build/reports, one CSV table in runtime/_build/tables, one PNG/PDF figure in runtime/_build/figures, and one log in runtime/_build/logs). The verifier should fail with a clear missing-file list and be runnable as a single command.

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
