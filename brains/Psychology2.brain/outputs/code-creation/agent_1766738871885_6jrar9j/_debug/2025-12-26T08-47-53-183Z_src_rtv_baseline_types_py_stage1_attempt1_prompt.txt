You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a minimal retrieve-then-verify baseline with: (a) claim decomposition, (b) retrieval, (c) quote-attribution checks, (d) support label + abstain rule; then evaluate on a small curated set with calibration + false-accept at risk tiers.
Project: generated_script_1766738872100 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/rtv_baseline/types.py
- Purpose: Dataclasses and type definitions for atomic claims, evidence chunks, retrieval results, verification decisions, and evaluation records.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- README.md: Project overview with setup, dataset format, and end-to-end instructions to run the retrieve-then-verify baseline and evaluation outputs.
- pyproject.toml: Python project configuration including dependencies, console scripts, and tool settings for a minimal reproducible baseline.
- src/rtv_baseline/__init__.py: Package initializer exposing the main pipeline and evaluation entrypoints for the retrieve-then-verify baseline.
- src/rtv_baseline/claim_decompose.py: Rule-based claim decomposition that converts an input claim into atomic claims with fixed machine-readable fields (subject, predicate, scope, provenance requirements).

Utility to capture Python/OS

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Dataclasses and type definitions for atomic claims, evidence chunks, retrieval results, verification decisions, and evaluation records.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/rtv_baseline/types.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/rtv_baseline/types.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/rtv_baseline/types.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
