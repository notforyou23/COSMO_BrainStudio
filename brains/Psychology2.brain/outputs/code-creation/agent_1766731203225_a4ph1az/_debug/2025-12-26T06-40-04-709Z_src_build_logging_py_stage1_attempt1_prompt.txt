Mission summary: Create or repair a single one-command build runner that sequentially triggers: artifact gate → taxonomy validation → meta-analysis demo, and fails fast with clear error messages. The runner must standardize output locations under runtime/_build/ and emit a final summary status.
Project: or repair a single one-command build runner that sequentially triggers: artifact gate → taxonomy validation → meta-analysis demo, and fails fast with clear error messages. The runner must standardize output locations under runtime/_build/ and emit a final summary status. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/build_logging.py
- Purpose: Logging and reporting utilities to write step-specific raw logs, structured summaries, and final status artifacts under runtime/_build/.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/build_runner.py: Single-command build runner CLI that sequentially executes artifact gate, taxonomy validation, and meta-analysis demo with standardized runtime/_build/ outputs, fail-fast behavior, clear errors, and a final summary status.
- src/build_steps.py: Implementation of the three build steps (artifact gate, taxonomy validation, meta-analysis demo) with consistent subprocess execution, logging, and output capture into runtime/_build/.
- src/build_paths.py: Path and directory management helpers that create and normalize the runtime/_build/ layout and provide stable locations for each step’s outputs.
- tests/test_build_runner_examples.py: End-to-end tests demonstrating example invocations and verifying fail-fast behavior, output standardization under runtime/_build/, and final summary emission.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Logging and reporting utilities to write step-specific raw logs, structured summaries, and final status artifacts under runtime/_build/.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/build_logging.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/build_logging.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/build_logging.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
