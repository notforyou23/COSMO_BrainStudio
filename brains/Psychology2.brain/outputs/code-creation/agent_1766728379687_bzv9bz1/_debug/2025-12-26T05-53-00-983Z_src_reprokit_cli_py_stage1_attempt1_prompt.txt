You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add default reproducibility files to /outputs: CITATION.cff, minimal data dictionary template, an OSF/GitHub mirroring checklist, and a reproducibility checklist embedded in the README; ensure scripts produce a run log (timestamp, package versions).
Project: generated_library_1766728379980 (python library)

Target file details:
- Path: src/reprokit/cli.py
- Purpose: Provides a small CLI entry point to generate a run log on demand and to standardize logging across scripts.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/CITATION.cff: Provides a default Citation File Format record to enable standardized citation metadata for the project outputs.
- outputs/README.md: Documents the contents of the outputs folder and embeds a reproducibility checklist to be completed for each run/release.
- outputs/data_dictionary_template.csv: Supplies a minimal data dictionary template (CSV) for documenting datasets, variables, units, missingness, and provenance.
- outputs/osf_github_mirroring_checklist.md: Provides a step-by-step checklist for mirroring the repository and releases between GitHub and OSF for preservation and access.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provides a small CLI entry point to generate a run log on demand and to standardize logging across scripts.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/reprokit/cli.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/reprokit/cli.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/reprokit/cli.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
