You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create and run an end-to-end meta-analysis starter-kit demo that generates real saved analysis outputs (at minimum: pooled estimate table + one figure) from a toy CSV, and writes outputs + logs to the canonical /outputs and _build/ structure. This directly fixes the '0 analysis outputs' gap and operationalizes goal_28.
Project: and run an end-to-end meta-analysis starter-kit demo that generates real saved analysis outputs (at minimum: pooled estimate table + one figure) from a toy CSV, and writes outputs + logs to the canonical /outputs and _build/ structure. This directly fixes the '0 analysis outputs' gap and operationalizes goal_28. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/meta_analysis_demo/__init__.py
- Purpose: Package initializer for the meta-analysis starter-kit demo modules.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/meta_analysis_demo/run_demo.py: End-to-end runnable script that loads a toy CSV, performs a meta-analysis, and writes pooled estimate tables, a forest plot, and logs into outputs/ and _build/.
- src/meta_analysis_demo/meta.py: Implements core meta-analysis computations (effect sizes, random/fixed effects pooling, heterogeneity stats) used by the demo runner.
- src/meta_analysis_demo/io_utils.py: Utilities for reading the toy input CSV, validating schema, and writing standardized CSV/JSON outputs into the canonical folder structure.
- src/meta_analysis_demo/plotting.py: Generates at least one saved figure (forest plot) from computed meta-analysis results and writes it to outputs/figures/.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Package initializer for the meta-analysis starter-kit demo modules.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/meta_analysis_demo/__init__.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/meta_analysis_demo/__init__.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/meta_analysis_demo/__init__.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
