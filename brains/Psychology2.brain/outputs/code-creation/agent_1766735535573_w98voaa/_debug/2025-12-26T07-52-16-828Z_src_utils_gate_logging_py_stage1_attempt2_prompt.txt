Mission summary: Add an 'ID integrity' QA gate to the project’s artifact gate script: block runs when IDs are non-unique, missing, or non-joinable across artifacts; log pass/fail status and counts of violations to /outputs/logs/.
Project: generated_script_1766735535723 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/utils/gate_logging.py
- Purpose: Provide a small logging utility to create /outputs/logs/ and write standardized gate status summaries and metrics for each QA check.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/artifact_gate.py: Update the artifact gate to include an ID integrity QA gate that blocks runs on missing, non-unique, or non-joinable IDs across artifacts and writes pass/fail plus violation counts to /outputs/logs/.
- src/qa/id_integrity.py: Implement the ID integrity checks (missing IDs, duplicate IDs, and cross-artifact joinability) with structured results consumable by the artifact gate.
- scripts/run_artifact_gate.py: Wire the updated artifact gate into the runnable entrypoint script so CI/local runs fail fast when ID integrity violations are detected and logs are emitted to /outputs/logs/.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provide a small logging utility to create /outputs/logs/ and write standardized gate status summaries and metrics for each QA check.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/utils/gate_logging.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/utils/gate_logging.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/utils/gate_logging.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
