You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Diagnose and fix the recurring 'Container lost' failure observed in CodeExecutionAgent attempts (execution aborted before testing any files). Produce a short `runtime/_build/execution_diagnostics.md` plus updated execution instructions or environment pinning so the smoke test can run reliably.
Project: generated_script_1766734791435 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/run_smoke_docker.sh
- Purpose: Shell wrapper that builds the Docker image, runs the smoke test with resource/timeouts, and saves logs for post-mortem debugging.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- runtime/_build/execution_diagnostics.md: Concise root-cause analysis of recurring 'Container lost' failures with concrete remediation steps and verification checklist.
- runtime/_build/execution_instructions.md: Step-by-step, reproducible local and CI execution instructions (including Docker commands) to run the smoke test reliably.
- Dockerfile: Single-stage Docker build that pins OS/Python tooling and installs dependencies deterministically for reliable smoke-test execution.
- requirements.txt: Primary Python dependency list for the project with compatible version ranges suitable for pinning in Docker/CI.

Utility to capture Python/OS

Key requirements:
- docker

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Shell wrapper that builds the Docker image, runs the smoke test with resource/timeouts, and saves logs for post-mortem debugging.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/run_smoke_docker.sh')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/run_smoke_docker.sh')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/run_smoke_docker.sh.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
