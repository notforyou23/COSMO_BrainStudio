You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a smallest-repro preflight script that triggers the failure; run it locally and in CI with maximal diagnostics (timestamps, resource usage, container logs, exit codes), then implement a deterministic repro harness that saves all incident artifacts into runtime/_build/incident_reports/ and fails fast with a clear signature.
Project: smallest-repro preflight (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: docker/preflight/docker-compose.yml
- Purpose: Compose definition for the smallest-repro pipeline with fixed image build context, explicit resource limits, and stable container names for deterministic log and artifact capture.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/preflight_repro.py: Standalone smallest-repro preflight runner that executes a containerized smoke pipeline with maximal diagnostics (timestamps, resource usage, container logs, exit codes) and fails fast with a deterministic signature while saving artifacts to runtime/_build/incident_reports/.
- scripts/incident_harness.py: Deterministic repro harness library used by preflight_repro.py to manage incident report directories, collect artifacts (env, versions, docker state, logs), compute signatures, and enforce fast-fail semantics.
- scripts/record_versions.py: Utility to capture Python/OS/tooling versions and write them as structured JSON for inclusion in incident reports.
- scripts/docker_diagnostics.py: Docker-focused diagnostics helpers to capture docker info/ps/images/inspect output, container stats sampling, and log extraction in a consistent, timestamped format.

Key requirements:
- docker

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Compose definition for the smallest-repro pipeline with fixed image build context, explicit resource limits, and stable container names for deterministic log and artifact capture.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('docker/preflight/docker-compose.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:docker/preflight/docker-compose.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside docker/preflight/docker-compose.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
