      "summary": "Summary judgment\nAll three branches converge on the same high‑level goal: increase robustness and cumulative theory building in cognitive/perceptual/developmental science by improving study design, transparency, and incentives. They differ primarily in focus and proposed leverage points (methods/replication, incentive structure, and specific transparency practices) and raise a few practical tensions about implementation and unintended consequences.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Core practices: preregistration, adequate statistical power, clear testable models, and sharing of data/materials/pipelines are central to improving reproducibility and cumulative knowledge.\n- Value of replication: deliberate, well-designed replications (ideally multi-site and varying sampling/measurement/analysis) are necessary to separate true mechanisms from methodological artifacts.\n- Incentives matter: aligning training, hiring, funding, and publication incentives with transparency and replication will change researcher behavior.\n- Domain generality: these practices are applicable across cognition, perception, and developmental labs, though operational details will vary by subfield.\n- Need for infrastructure and training: successful adoption requires repositories, standards for methods reporting, and researcher training in design and open practices.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Rigor vs. flexibility: Branch 1 and 3 emphasize strict preregistration and fixed pipelines to improve reproducibility; branches that stress incentive change (Branch 2) may allow more flexibility for early‑career creativity. Strict preregistration can feel constraining to exploratory work.\n- Resource burden and equity: Multi‑site, high‑powered replications and mandatory data/pipeline sharing impose financial, time, and logistical costs. This may disadvantage small labs or labs in low‑resource settings unless funded/support mechanisms exist.\n- Incentive displacement and gaming risks: Rewarding replications and preregistration could lead to box‑checking (performative compliance) or conservative research programs that avoid risky, novel hypotheses.\n- Domain differences: Developmental work (e.g., longitudinal child studies) has larger sampling/ethical constraints than adult cognition studies; what’s feasible for “concrete, multi-site longitudinal replications” varies.\n- Measurement of success: Branches imply different evaluation metrics (replication rates, transparency indicators, career outcomes). Prioritizing one metric can skew behavior.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, actionable)\na. Pilot coordinated programs (short timeline, evaluative design)\n   - Fund and run a set of multi‑site, pre‑registered replications across the three domains (cognition, perception, developmental) with deliberately varied sampling/measures to test generality and cost/logistics.\n   - Include small, medium, and large labs to assess equity and feasibility.\n\nb. Test incentive interventions experimentally\n   - Implement and evaluate pilot incentive packages at a few graduate programs or departments (e.g., hiring/funding credit for preregistration + data sharing; formal credit for replication outputs).\n   - Track early‑career decision metrics (project choice, publication types, application behavior) and outcome metrics (time to degree, publication rate, career placement).\n\nc. Infrastructure + standards\n   - Create domain‑specific templates for preregistration, data & stimulus sharing, and analysis pipelines that allow for transparent exploratory vs confirmatory distinctions.\n   - Fund centralized repositories and provide small grants to help low‑resource labs meet data‑sharing/replication costs.\n\nd. Guardrails to avoid harms\n   - Encourage journals and funders to accept registered reports and replication studies with meaningful credit.\n   - Build assessment metrics that value methodological rigor and openness as part of hiring/promotion (not just count of publications).\n   - Allow explicit, documented exploratory analyses within preregistration frameworks (to preserve innovation).\n\ne. Meta‑research monitoring\n   - Concurrently fund meta‑science studies to measure the impact of preregistration, materials sharing, and incentive changes on reproducibility, novelty, and career outcomes over 3–7 years.\n   - Use mixed metrics: reproducibility estimates, citation/translation impact, career equity indicators, and researcher attitudes.\n\nConcise recommended roadmap (next 12–36 months)\n1. Launch 6–9 multi‑site replication pilots across domains (with funded coordination).\n2. Run 3 departmental/institutional incentive pilots with randomized or matched evaluation.\n3. Publish domain‑specific reporting/preregistration templates and provide repository grants.\n4. Monitor outcomes with a preplanned meta‑study and revise policies based on evidence.\n\nBottom line: Combine Branch 1’s methodological rigor (multi‑site replications), Branch 3’s emphasis on detailed openness, and Branch 2’s incentive reforms—but implement them experimentally, with infrastructure and equity supports, and monitor for unintended consequences before broad mandates."
