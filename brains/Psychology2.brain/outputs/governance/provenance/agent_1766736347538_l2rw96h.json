The deliverable should be directly usable by development and research teams and include measurable acceptance criteria and a short timeline for pilot testing.\n\n**Generated:** 2025-12-26T05:34:00.030Z\n**Sources:** 9 memory nodes\n**Sections:** 8\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report specifies an end-to-end, auditable workflow for primary-source scholarship in psychology, centered on “provenance-aware citation” so that every quoted claim can be traced from **Work → Expression/Translation → Manifestation/Edition → Item/Repository copy → Citation/Quotation**. The core deliverable is a standardized protocol (checklists + decision rules) that research teams can execute consistently and that editors/archivists can verify, reducing citation ambiguity, translation/edition drift, and unverifiable secondary quoting. To make compliance lightweight, the report pairs the protocol with a minimal software stack: a **Zotero plugin** for capture and library normalization, thin **Word/Google Docs add-ins** for inline provenance flags during writing, and a small validation/test harness to check required fields, formats, and link integrity before submission.\n\nInteroperability is operationalized through a FRBR-aligned canonical metadata schema with explicit field definitions and validation rules, enabling export to common formats and consistent cross-repository exchange. The empirical plan is preregistered and designed to produce publishable evidence\n\n2. [FORK:fork_15] Fast, heuristic-driven decisions are efficient but can embed bias. Pick one recurring, high-impact choice and attach a simple \"if–then\" rule — e.g., \"If this affects >3 people or >$1k, pause and run a 3-question checklist (purpose, evidence, downside) before committing.\"\n\n3. [FORK:fork_11] Tiny tweaks in choice architecture—framing, defaults, sequencing, and salience—can reliably nudge decisions by changing perceived effort and attention with minimal cost. Key limitation: effects are highly context- and population-specific and can backfire or erode autonomy if applied without testing and ethical safeguards.\n\n4. [FORK:fork_2] Iterative feedback cycles strengthen cognitive consistency by aligning beliefs and actions through repeated, timely signals, which reduces dissonance and stabilizes decision routines. A key limitation is that they can create echo chambers—overweighting confirming feedback and entrenching biased or suboptimal decisions, reducing adaptability to novel information.\n\n5.

[FORK:fork_3] A major limitation is that decision‑making research often relies on simplified lab tasks that lack ecological validity and real‑world incentives, limiting generalizability. To address this, embed naturalistic, incentivized decision tasks into longitudinal, sensor‑assisted field studies (e.g., mobile apps with real rewards) to capture richer, context‑dependent behavior.\n\n14. Memory is reconstructive rather than a literal recording, so it is highly susceptible to distortion from suggestion, misinformation, and current beliefs. This means confidence or vividness of a memory does not guarantee accuracy, posing a serious limitation for eyewitness testimony and clinical inference.\n\n15. [FORK:fork_16] Treating introspection as a Bayesian observer means self-reports are posterior estimates that combine noisy internal evidence (likelihood) with prior beliefs, so many introspective biases (overconfidence, anchoring) are predictable consequences of strong priors or high measurement noise. Therefore improving self-knowledge requires shifting priors or enhancing internal signal quality (feedback, calibration), not assuming introspection is inherently reliable.\n\n16. [SUMMARY] Memory entry — Key insights, patterns, decisions, open questions (condensed) Core theme - Introspection is informative but fallible: subjective reports are noisy, reconstructive, post-hoc, and shaped by predictive models, memory biases, social framing and confabulation. Treat introspective claims as partial “logs” that require triangulation with behavioral, physiological, or neural data. Reliable takeaways about introspection and metacognition - Strengths: reliably reports subjective feelings and yields data that shape future decisions, learning, and motivation. - Limits: blind to fast/automatic processes, misattributes causes/confidence, vulnerable to social desirability and verbalization constraints. - Practical principle: treat introspection as one noisy data source, not definitive evidence. Digital/tracking effects on self-knowledge and behavior - Continuous digital self‑tracking (feeds, wearables, journaling) both scaffolds and distorts self-knowledge: - Scaffolding: richer external cues can improve some judgments and memory. - Distortion: amplifies salience and social-comparison biases, shifting motivations and choices systematically across development. Actionable measurement & intervention ideas - Low-burden metacognitive practices: - 5-minute daily \"thought audit\": list 3 recurring thoughts, label (worry/plan/judgment), rate intensity 1–5; after 1 week pick one to reframe and practice. - Timestamped thought-journal: 3–4 words per entry paired with simple behavioral measures (reaction time, error rates) to triangulate subjective reports with objective performance. - Decision-support interventions: small changes in choice architecture (framing/sequence) often alter behavior more than extra information; use structured decision aids, precommitment, and targeted debiasing for modest, context-dependent gains. - Metacognitive training question: how does structured training in childhood/adolescence calibrate subjective confidence to objective accuracy in real-world tasks? Research-methods and reproducibility - Introspection needs external “debugging”: combine self-reports with behavioral, physiological, neural measures (EEG, RT modeling, predictive-processing frameworks). - Preregistration and publishing full methods (stimuli, exclusions, pipelines) likely improves reproducibility and cumulative theory-building. - Standardized ID taxonomy (StudyID/EffectID/TaskID) can reduce labeling noise in meta-analyses and permit treating task labels as moderators—but only if precise operational definitions, semantic alignment, and quality control are enforced; otherwise IDs can ossify inconsistency. Perception, AR, and predictive priors - Predictive priors fill sensory gaps. Augmented Reality mismatches create “predictive-overlay dissonance” that shifts attention/trust toward the more coherent input and can recalibrate low-level perceptual expectations over time (effects persist after AR is removed). Behavioral dynamics and development - Fast heuristic processes often dominate decisions (availability, anchoring, loss aversion, status quo bias); interventions reduce but do not eliminate biases and are fragile. - Short-term interventions commonly decay unless they alter developmental processes, social/environmental supports, or are repeatedly reinforced. - Repeated environmental instability increases cognitive load and prompts adaptive shifts in\n\n17. [AGENT: agent_1766724144474_v4ynwtw] Cycle 4 consistency review (divergence 0.93):\nSummary (given divergence score 0.93 — substantial disagreement across branches)\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Human behavior is strongly shaped by both fast, intuitive processes (heuristics/System 1) and time/physiological factors (motivation/reward sensitivity). All three branches accept that predictable cognitive patterns can be used to design interventions.\n- Simple, low-cost interventions can improve outcomes: prompts/delays and implementation intentions are evidence-based ways to reduce errors and increase follow-through; scheduling work to match when someone feels better/more motivated can improve productivity.\n- Combining situational scaffolds (environmental or timing changes) with psychological scaffolds (plans, prompts, brief deliberation) is a plausible route to reduce failures of self-control and judgment.\n\n2) Conflicting points (where branches diverge or possibly contradict)\n- Mechanism wording in Branch 1: it claims “interventions that slow deliberation … can markedly reduce errors.” Practically, effective interventions typically increase deliberation on specific decisions (prompting reflection, brief delay) rather than “slowing” global deliberative capacity. This is a semantic/operational inconsistency that can be misread.\n- Scope and primacy of solutions:\n  - Branch 1 emphasizes meta-cognitive prompts/delays to overcome heuristic biases.\n  - Branch 3 emphasizes precommitment/implementation intentions to counter present bias.\n  - Branch 2 prioritizes aligning tasks with biological motivation windows (circadian/dopamine peaks).\n  These are not mutually exclusive but they prioritize different levers (judgment processes vs. foresight/commitment vs. motivational timing). High divergence indicates they may recommend different first-line interventions for the same problem.\n- Practical conflict: Branch 2’s reliance on identifying a “dopamine window” assumes stable, measurable intra-day reward sensitivity; in many people this is noisy and interacts with sleep, stress, and task context. If present bias (Branch 3) or strong heuristics (Branch 1) are dominant, mere timing may be insufficient—commitment devices or prompts might still be required.\n- Implementation conflict: If you schedule demanding work for a peak window (Branch 2) but still rely on System 1 habits (Branch 1) or face powerful immediate temptations (Branch 3), productivity gains may be reduced unless combined with planning or nudges.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\nSynthesis principle: Use a hybrid, hierarchical approach — optimize when you do tasks (Branch 2) and protect those periods with precommitment plans (Branch 3) plus targeted reflective prompts for high-stakes decisions (Branch 1).\n\nPractical next steps (n-of-1 experiments you can run quickly)\n- Identify your peak window:\n  - Track for 1–2 weeks: sleep/wake times, mood/energy ratings, simple productivity metric for tasks (30–60 min blocks).\n  - Tentatively label highest-consistency blocks as “peak.”\n- Schedule: assign high-effort/creative work to those peak blocks.\n- Layer commitment: before each peak block, set simple precommitments (calendar blocks with accountability, automatic website blockers, or implementation intentions like “If I open X, then I will close it and …”).\n- Use prompts/delays for critical judgments: for decisions with evident bias risk (high stakes, irreversible), add a brief forced delay or a “why” prompt checklist to invoke deliberation.\n- Measure: compare completion, quality, and subjective difficulty across matched tasks done in peak vs non-peak windows, and with vs without commitment/prompts. Run for 2–4 weeks and iterate.\n\nWhen to favor which lever\n- If errors are judgemental and systematic (e.g., framing, anchoring): prioritize Branch 1 interventions (prompts, forced pause).\n- If failure is failure-to-start or procrastination: prioritize Branch 2 (timing) + Branch 3 (implementation intentions).\n- If temptations repeatedly derail plans: prioritize Branch 3 (commitment devices) and add timing adjustments where feasible.\n\nConcise recommendation: combine timing (schedule hard work in your physiological peaks) with precommitments that lock in behavior, and use brief reflective prompts only for high-stakes decisions. Run short, tracked experiments to validate which combination works for you.\n\n18. [FORK:fork_28] Introspection often feels direct but is shaped by biases, confabulation, and unconscious processes, so it rarely gives complete or wholly accurate access to mental causation. Treat introspective reports as useful hypotheses that must be validated against behavior, physiological measures, and controlled experiments.\n\n19. [CONSOLIDATED] To make introspective data scientifically useful, elicit it immediately in a standardized, time-locked way and validate it against concurrent objective measures—treating it as a bias-prone, reactive, and inherently incomplete window on experience that can be mitigated and modeled, but never fully replace behavioral/physiological evidence.\n\n20. [AGENT: agent_1766732276386_ixmg67a] # SYNTHESIS REPORT\n\n**Mission:** Produce a community-ready protocol package for primary-source scholarship in psychology: a concise protocol document (checklists, metadata schema, recommended citation formats) plus a prioritised specification for lightweight software/plugins that auto-detect edition/translation provenance, variant pagination, and public-domain repository citations. The agent should produce deliverables that are ready for community review (README, machine-readable schema examples, annotated checklist) and a clear empirical evaluation plan (survey + audit-study design and metrics) for testing effects on citation accuracy, reproducibility, and researcher usability.\n\n**Generated:** 2025-12-26T07:00:12.681Z\n**Sources:** 9 memory nodes\n**Sections:** 8\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report proposes a community-ready protocol package to fix a common failure mode in primary-source scholarship in psychology: citations that look complete but cannot be independently re-found because edition/translation provenance, stable repository identifiers, and pagination/locator variants are not recorded. The package provides a compact, reviewable standard (annotated checklists, a minimal metadata schema with machine-readable examples, and recommended citation formats) that makes provenance explicit end-to-end—linking the cited claim to the exact edition/translation, source repository, and passage locator(s) needed for passage-level re-findability and auditability across print/PDF/scan/HTML versions.\n\nTo operationalize the standard without new infrastructure, the report specifies lightweight, interoperable tooling (plugins/scripts) that auto-detect and flag provenance gaps: edition/translation inference, variant pagination mapping, and public-domain repository citation capture, with user-facing warnings when re-findability is at risk. Finally, it outlines an empirical evaluation plan—combining a survey of researcher workflows with an audit study—using pre-registered metrics for citation/provenance accuracy, passage-level reproducibility, and usability/adoption burden. An implementation and governance plan recommends shipping as a versioned “starter kit” repository with clear change control and community review, enabling journals, labs, and educators to adopt incrementally while keeping the standard stable, transparent, and testable.\n\n---\n\n## 1) PROTOCOL PACKAGE FOR PRIMARY-SOURCE SCHOLARSHIP (COMMUNITY-READY STANDARD)\n\n### 1) Protocol Package for Primary-Source Scholarship (Community-Ready Standard)\n\nThis protocol package addresses a recurring failure mode in primary-source scholarship in psychology: citations that *appear* complete but are not independently re-findable because the underlying provenance chain (edition/translation, repository object identity, scan/OCR lineage, and locator system) is implicit, inconsistent, or lost after note-taking. The scope therefore extends beyond “proper citation style” to the full lifecycle of *verifiable quotation capture*: (a) selecting and documenting the exact source instantiation (print edition, translation, reprint, digitized surrogate), (b) recording stable repository identifiers and variant-aware locators at the moment a passage is quoted, and (c) preserving these details in machine-checkable metadata so tools can validate consistency end-to-end. The package is designed as a community-ready standard with two deliverables: a concise 1–2 page protocol summary for everyday use (journal authors, students, reviewers) and a full 5–10 page specification for implementers and repositories (including validation rules, quality gates, and audit artifacts such as timestamps and checksums). The guiding principle is reproducibility-as-provenance: every citation is treated as an auditable chain linking a claim to a specific, identifiable digital object (or physical artifact) with a documented transformation history.\n\nThe protocol formalizes a layered metadata stack that matches how digitized primary sources are actually distributed and maintained. Descriptive metadata (e.g., Dublin Core or MODS) captures bibliographic identity and responsibility; archival hierarchy is represented through EAD3 where relevant (fonds/series/file/item); and packaging/structural metadata uses METS—including the newer METS 2 release (March 2025) where repositories support it—to bind scans, OCR, transcripts, and derived formats into a single coherent digital object. For text-centric scholarly editions and correspondence, TEI P5 remains the interoperable encoding baseline, with TEI CMIF providing a pragmatic interchange profile for letters and other epistolary materials via `correspDesc`. The protocol does not require any one ecosystem, but it insists that citations resolve across them: e.g., a quoted line in a TEI transcription must be traceable to a specific scan image in a METS package, which itself is anchored to a stable repository identifier and descriptive record. This layered approach is what enables machine-checkable verification: tooling can compare claimed edition/translation metadata against repository records, confirm that a passage locator is valid for the cited instantiation, and flag common mismatches (wrong translation, reprint with different pagination, OCR-derived text quoted as if it were authorial).\n\nOperationally, the package provides annotated checklists and recommended citation formats that explicitly handle the two most common friction points: (1) *edition/translation provenance* and (2) *variant pagination/paragraph numbering*. The provenance checklist requires capturing: full bibliographic identification (author, work title, editor/translator, edition statement, publisher/place/date), physical-to-digital relationship (e.g., “digitized from 1898 Leipzig printing”), and repository object identity (persistent URL plus any local identifier; when available, DOI/ARK/Handle). The locator checklist requires recording *at least two* locators when feasible—e.g., print page number plus paragraph/section marker or TEI/XML anchor—so that passages remain findable across reprints and digitized surrogates. The public-domain repository checklist adds requirements often omitted in humanities-style citations but essential for reproducibility: exact repository name, object identifier, access date, file type/version when relevant (PDF vs JP2 set vs plain OCR text), and a checksum for locally cached artifacts when quotations depend on a downloaded file. Recommended formats include (i) a human-readable reference optimized for journal copyediting (traditional bibliographic citation + repository ID + locator) and (ii) a structured “citation capsule” that can be embedded in supplements or deposited alongside data/code. Example (schematic): *Work (author, year/edition), translator/editor, repository object ID (ARK/Handle/URL), scan page image ID or file, locator (p./¶/section), access date; local checksum if quoted from downloaded derivative*. This is complemented by lightweight validation rules (“quality gates”) that can be enforced during manuscript submission or project builds—e.g., “translation specified if language differs,” “repository identifier present,” “locator resolvable against chosen edition,” and “digitized surrogate declared if no physical consultation occurred.”\n\nTo make the standard adoptable, the protocol includes a machine-readable metadata schema with JSON-LD examples that map cleanly to existing infrastructures while remaining simple enough for researchers to complete. The schema defines required fields for (a) `SourceInstantiation` (edition/translation identifiers, responsibility statements, language), (b) `RepositoryObject` (persistent identifier, holding institution, access pathway, rights/public-domain status), (c) `Derivation` (scan → OCR → cleaned transcription lineage), and (d) `PassageLocator` (multi-locator support: page, image, paragraph, TEI anchor, timecode for audio). By design, this schema can align with Dublin Core/MODS terms for description, METS for file/structural relationships, and TEI for textual anchors, enabling repositories and journals to validate submissions without forcing a single platform. Finally, the package specifies a prioritized tooling roadmap: small plugins/scripts that (1) auto-detect edition/translation signals from PDFs/TEI headers/repository records, (2) warn when pagination/paragraph numbering conflicts with known variants, and (3) generate citation capsules plus auditable build artifacts (manifests, timestamps, checksums, validation logs). This closes the loop between scholarship and verification: protocols become enforceable, errors become detectable, and independent re-finding of quoted primary sources becomes measurably more reliable.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 2) LIGHTWEIGHT TOOLING/PLUGINS SPECIFICATION (AUTO-DETECTION + USER-FACING FLAGS)\n\n## 2) Lightweight Tooling/Plugins Specification (Auto-Detection + User-Facing Flags)\n\nThe tooling layer operationalizes the protocol as a small set of interoperable components that fit existing primary-source workflows while enforcing provenance and quality gates end-to-end. The core requirement is a shared data model aligned to the protocol’s metadata schema (work/manifestation/item identifiers; edition/translation provenance; pagination regime; repository identifiers; and derivative artifacts), with lossless round-tripping across environments. Concretely, the system should expose (1) a local library service (CLI + background daemon) that validates metadata, computes checksums, stores “build artifacts” (logs, timestamps, file paths, version hashes), and serves a stable API; and (2) thin integrations at key entrypoints: reference managers (Zotero, BibTeX/BibLaTeX, EndNote via RIS), word processors (Word/LibreOffice via citation style add-ons; LaTeX via BibLaTeX hooks), PDF readers (Zotero PDF, Adobe, Okular), and browser extensions (for repository landing pages, IIIF viewers, and Google Books/HathiTrust/Internet Archive). In archival contexts the tool must recognize layered metadata stacks—e.g., Dublin Core/MODS for description, EAD3 for collection hierarchy, and METS (including METS 2) for packaging scans/OCR/transcripts—and map them into the protocol schema without discarding original fields, preserving a “source metadata snapshot” for auditability. Each run of the tool should produce versioned outputs (updated citation records, normalized page maps, provenance statements) plus machine-readable validation reports so that improvements are objectively verifiable and reviewable.\n\nIntegration entrypoints should be designed around minimal friction and explicit, user-facing uncertainty flags. In reference managers, the plugin should add a “Primary Source Provenance” panel with fields such as: *Work ID*, *Manifestation ID*, *Repository (canonical URL + persistent ID)*, *Scan/derivative checksum*, *Edition statement*, *Translator*, *Publication year*, *Pagination regime*, and *Confidence score*. In word processors, the plugin should inject a compact “citation health” indicator that warns when a citation mixes page numbers from a scan PDF with a print edition reference, or when the translator/edition is missing. In PDF readers, the tool should capture page-anchored highlights with dual coordinates: (a) PDF page index and bounding box, and (b) normalized logical page label (e.g., “p. 73” as printed), storing both in the annotation export to avoid future pagination drift. In browsers, the extension should detect repository-provided metadata (e.g., IIIF manifests, MARC-derived MODS, Dublin Core meta tags) and offer a one-click “Import with Provenance” action that saves the landing-page URL, access date, repository ID, and content checksums, producing an auditable acquisition record. Across all entrypoints, the system should enforce quality gates: missing required fields trigger *blocking* errors for “publish/export,” while non-critical ambiguities trigger *warnings* with suggested fixes and a link to the underlying evidence (metadata source, OCR snippet, or repository record).\n\nAuto-detection focuses on two high-impact problems: edition/translation provenance and pagination variants. For edition/translation detection, implement a cascade of heuristics: (1) metadata harvesting from repository records (edition statements, contributor roles, language codes, publication place/publisher) and embedded PDF metadata; (2) title-page OCR parsing using pattern libraries (“Translated by”, “Übertragen von”, “Traduit par”; edition markers like “2nd ed.” / “Zweite Auflage”); (3) fingerprinting via identifiers (ISBN/DOI/OCLC) when available; (4) similarity matching of front-matter strings against a local registry of known manifestations; and (5) fallbacks to user confirmation when confidence is low. For pagination variants, the tool should explicitly distinguish at least three regimes: *printed page numbers* (logical labels), *scan/PDF page indices*, and *ebook/HTML location schemes*. Detection can combine (a) OCR-based extraction of running headers/footers for page labels; (b) detection of Roman numerals in front matter; (c) page-label extraction from PDF “Page Labels” when present; and (d) mapping via structural cues (table of contents anchors, chapter starts) to build a page map that links logical labels to PDF indices. Conflicts—e.g., a scan that omits plates/pages, or a “facsimile” whose printed labels do not match the OCR—must be surfaced as explicit flags (e.g., *Pagination mismatch: likely missing pages 112–113*), with an option to attach corroborating evidence (scan thumbnails, repository notes) and to export a normalized “page map” artifact for downstream use.\n\nUser-facing flagging rules should be standardized, actionable, and exportable. The UI should separate **Errors** (block export), **Warnings** (allow export but mark citations as “provisional”), and **Info** (helpful provenance notes). Example error rules: missing repository canonical URL or persistent identifier; missing edition/translator when language differs from the original; checksum mismatch between stored and current PDF (indicating an updated/altered file); or citations containing only PDF page indices without a declared pagination regime. Example warning rules: edition inferred from OCR with confidence <0.8; multiple candidate manifestations match within a narrow score margin; logical page labels partially detected (<90% coverage); or repository metadata conflicts with title-page OCR (e.g., publication year mismatch). A minimal sample I/O illustrates expected behavior: **Input** (browser import from Internet Archive): landing URL + IIIF manifest + PDF. **Output**: a validated metadata record containing `work_id`, `manifestation_id`, `repository_id`, `source_metadata_snapshot`, `checksums`, `edition_provenance` (evidence-linked), and `pagination_map` (logical→PDF index), plus a human-readable log and a JSON validation report. When the user inserts a citation in Word—e.g., “(Author, 1899/1912, p. 73)”—the plugin resolves “p. 73” to the correct scan coordinate, stores both representations, and appends a provenance note (edition/translator/repository) to the bibliography. If later the PDF is replaced or a different scan is imported, the system detects checksum or page-map divergence, flags affected citations, and prompts a controlled reconciliation workflow rather than silently drifting—preserving the protocol’s goal of reproducible, provenance-aware primary-source scholarship.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 3) EMPIRICAL EVALUATION PLAN (SURVEY + AUDIT STUDY + PRE-REGISTERED METRICS)\n\n## 3) Empirical Evaluation Plan (Survey + Audit Study + Pre-Registered Metrics)\n\nWe will evaluate whether the **protocol + provenance-aware tooling** improves (i) citation/provenance accuracy, (ii) passage-level reproducibility (re-findability), and (iii) usability/adoption feasibility in real workflows. The evaluation is **pre-registered on OSF** and intentionally mixed-method: a controlled **workflow task + survey** experiment to quantify perceived burden and adoption barriers, paired with a **blinded audit study** that measures objective error reduction and verification speed against business-as-usual practice. Participants will be recruited from the key workflow roles the intervention targets—**authors/graduate researchers**, **journal editorial staff**, and **librarians/archivists/curators**—with stratification by experience level and by the repositories most implicated in failure modes (e.g., **PsychClassics** HTML reprints with weak pagination; **Project Gutenberg** with edition ambiguity; scan-based repositories such as **Internet Archive/HathiTrust** with page-image anchors). The study materials use a standardized “claim bank” of historically grounded quotations/attributions designed to stress-test edition/translation drift and locator fragility, aligning outcomes directly to the protocol’s provenance chain (Work → Expression/Translation → Manifestation/Edition → Item/Repository copy → Citation/Quotation).\n\n**Survey + task experiment (adoption barriers, perceived burden, trust).** Participants will be randomized to **baseline workflow** (their usual citation practice) versus **protocol+tool workflow** (checklist + validator/plugin prompts + structured provenance record export) for a bundle of 6–10 micro-tasks: (1) capture bibliographic identity and access pathway; (2) identify/record edition and translator/editor where applicable; (3) map two quotations to the required locator strategy (page/folio + scan anchor when available, else structural anchor + quote fingerprint); and (4) produce a submission-ready citation with “Accessed via …” repository metadata and stable identifiers. The survey instrument includes (a) standardized usability/workload scales (e.g., **SUS** for usability; **NASA-TLX** for perceived workload), and (b) a short protocol-specific module with Likert items and free-response prompts covering **adoption barriers** (time cost, training needs, ambiguity in decision rules), **perceived burden** (setup time per source variant; time per quote mapping; alert fatigue), and **trust/editorial value** (confidence that readers/auditors can re-find passages; perceived reduction in “which edition/translation?” back-and-forth; willingness to adopt if journal-required). Concrete examples are embedded in the instrument to probe known pain points: “How burdensome is recording both printed page and IA viewer page index?” and “How clear is the rule for citing page numbers when using an HTML reprint without pagination?” Primary survey endpoints are pre-registered with practical thresholds (e.g., **SUS ≥ 70**; manageable workload; ≥80% of checklist steps rated “clear/usable” with no unresolved blocking ambiguities), and will be triangulated against task telemetry (completion time, number of failed validation checks, and number/type of clarification questions participants generate).\n\n**Blinded audit study (baseline vs intervention) with sampling and coding plan.** The audit is designed to detect whether the intervention reduces the error taxonomy the protocol was built around: missing translator/editor when a translation is used, ambiguous/wrong edition statements, unstable/missing repository identifiers, and locators incompatible with the consulted artifact (e.g., page numbers cited for non-paginated HTML). We will construct a baseline corpus from **recently published articles** (e.g., 30–50 per participating outlet, where feasible) and extract **primary-source citation–claim pairs**, then sample a stratified subset (target 300–600 claim instances total) that oversamples high-risk categories: translations, multi-edition works, HTML-first sources, OCR-derived quotations, and secondary citations. In parallel, we will sample pilot manuscripts or standardized claim reproductions produced under the **protocol+tool** condition and code them with the same rubric. Coding will be performed by trained raters using a structured codebook; we will double-code a substantial subset and require **Cohen’s κ ≥ 0.80** on the main error categories before full coding proceeds, with adjudication rules for legitimate ambiguity (e.g., multiple acceptable translations are allowed only if explicitly labeled and locators are valid for the consulted Item). Each claim instance will be scored for (1) bibliographic/provenance correctness (Work vs Expression vs Item properly distinguished), (2) locator completeness (presence of the locator triple: variant_id + page/folio/structural address + anchor/fingerprint), and (3) auditor re-findability under time constraints.\n\n**Primary metrics and pre-registered analysis plan (hypotheses, models, inclusion/exclusion, power, reporting).** The pre-registered primary endpoints are: **(H1) citation/provenance accuracy rate** (1 − error rate per claim; high-severity errors include wrong/missing translator when translation is used, wrong/ambiguous edition, missing stable repository ID/URL/access date, and unverifiable locator); **(H2) reproducibility score** operationalized as the **5-minute re-findability rate** (an independent auditor can locate the cited passage within 5 minutes using only the provenance record); and **(H3) time-to-locate-source** (seconds to re-locate the passage), supplemented by link integrity checks (broken-link rate at “submission time,” target ≤2%) and a weighted provenance completeness tier (A/B/C). We will model claim-level outcomes using **mixed-effects regression** to reflect clustering (claims nested within participants/manuscripts, nested within outlet/repository strata): logistic mixed models for binary outcomes (error/no error; re-found/not re-found), and (log-)linear or survival-style mixed models for time-to-locate. Inclusion/exclusion rules are specified up front: only claim instances that assert a primary-source-supported attribution/quotation are eligible; secondary citations are included but flagged as such and analyzed as a prespecified subgroup; copyrighted full-text is never redistributed (auditors use lawful access routes; outputs store only short snippets or quote fingerprints). Power planning follows feasibility assumptions already scoped for the pilot (e.g., baseline error ≈0.30/claim; ICC≈0.10; ~10 claims/participant), targeting ~70 participants/arm for the controlled task component and sufficient claim instances in the audit to detect a **≥20–30% relative reduction** in error rates and a **≥20% increase** in 5-minute reproducibility without >10% median time burden increase (or with compensating reductions in editorial clarification cycles). Reporting will include effect sizes with uncertainty, a public error taxonomy tied to specific protocol/tool rule changes, and a preregistered transparency package (de-identified codebook, adjudication log, and aggregated metrics), ensuring the evaluation directly informs iteration toward a stable v1.0 standard rather than producing one-off usability results.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 4) IMPLEMENTATION & GOVERNANCE (ROLLOUT, VERSIONING, AND COMMUNITY REVIEW)\n\n## 4) Implementation & Governance (Rollout, Versioning, and Community Review)\n\nImplementation should ship as a “community starter kit” that is reviewable, forkable, and usable by journals/labs without new infrastructure. The canonical distribution is a versioned public repository release (GitHub mirrored to OSF/Zenodo for DOI minting), with a README that orients three audiences: **authors/labs** (quickstart workflow + one-page checklist), **editors/reviewers** (spot‑check rubric + what to require at submission), and **developers/archives** (schema, validators, and crosswalks). A minimal but sufficient README structure is: *Purpose & scope; Definitions (Work/Expression/Manifestation/Item; “provenance-aware citation”); Quickstart (Zotero/Word/Docs/CLI); Required artifacts for submission (validationReport + provenanceRecords.jsonld + augmented bibliography); Examples (PsychClassics HTML without pagination; Gutenberg edition ambiguity; Internet Archive scan with page images); Repository compatibility notes; Governance & contribution; Changelog & decision log; Pilot onboarding.* Packaging should include a zipped “journal bundle” (offline-friendly) containing: the Protocol PDF, author checklist, editor/reviewer rubric, JSON-LD examples, CSL-JSON/BibTeX crosswalk notes, and a sample validation report—so an editorial office can adopt guidance-only requirements immediately and later move to automated validation.\n\nVersioning must be explicit and conservative because journals and archives treat standards as compliance targets. We recommend **semantic versioning** for each artifact stream with coupled releases: **protocol text**, **schema/validators**, and **tooling**. During pilots (v0.x), breaking changes are allowed but must be announced with migration notes; after a stability milestone (v1.0), breaking changes require an RFC cycle and a deprecation window. Each release should publish (a) a human-readable CHANGELOG, (b) machine-readable schema diffs (field additions/renames; required/optional changes), and (c) a compatibility matrix. Compatibility notes should cover (i) **citation styles** (APA/Chicago/MLA) by separating *rendering* from *data*: the underlying record exports loss‑minimized CSL‑JSON/BibTeX plus a provenance extension, while style files render “Accessed via [repository] (ID …), accessed YYYY‑MM‑DD” without misattributing repositories as publishers; (ii) **Crossref/DOI realities**, where many primary texts lack DOIs or have DOIs that identify modern editions rather than the consulted scan—so the protocol treats DOI as a Work/Manifestation identifier when applicable but still requires an Item-level repository PID/URL and access date; and (iii) **public-domain/open repositories** (PsychClassics, Gutenberg, Internet Archive/HathiTrust) where pagination and edition signals vary—requiring dual-channel locators (printed page/folio when available + structural anchor/TEI `xml:id` or deterministic paragraph address plus quote fingerprint) and a rights/access statement (e.g., `public_domain`, `open_fulltext`, `metadata_only`, `rights_unknown—manual_review`) to prevent unlawful redistribution while preserving verifiability.\n\nCommunity review and maintenance need lightweight but auditable governance: a public issue tracker, templated contribution guidelines, and a decision log that records recurring judgment calls as bias-aware if–then rules. Contribution guidelines should specify: scope boundaries (what is in/out for the pilot), required test fixtures for repository matchers, how to propose schema changes (problem → proposal → examples → backward compatibility → validator updates), and review expectations (at least one editor/archives reviewer plus one technical reviewer for schema/tool changes). The **decision log** should capture repeatable rules that otherwise drift across teams, e.g.: *If the cited artifact is HTML/plain text without stable pagination, then page numbers are “non-verifiable” and the citation must include a structural locator (chapter/section/paragraph) plus a quote fingerprint; if page images/IIIF are available, then record printed page + image index/canvas as the primary anchor.* *If a translation is used and translator credit is discoverable in the artifact metadata/front matter, then translator is required and omission is a must-fix error; if translator is unknown, then record “translator unknown” plus evidence (what was checked) rather than guessing.* *If multiple editions match bibliographic cues, then the tool must not auto-select; it must emit `ambiguous_expression` and require human confirmation.* These rules are explicitly “bias-aware” in the sense that they prevent silent defaults (e.g., privileging the most accessible repository copy, or assuming the most cited translation is the one used) and force the workflow to surface uncertainty as structured metadata rather than narrative hedging.\n\nFinally, rollout governance should follow a staged pilot roadmap with clear update criteria so the standard evolves empirically rather than by accretion. The recommended pathway is **(A) guidance-only**, where journals add a short author-instructions block and request (optional) validator reports; **(B) submission-time validation**, where authors must upload the validation report and provenance records and editors triage only “must-fix” errors (missing translator/edition signals; unverifiable locators; missing stable repository identifiers); and **(C) deposit requirement**, where accepted papers deposit the provenance package (JSON-LD records, augmented bibliography, validation report, and any lawful derivative tables) to OSF/Zenodo/institutional repositories. Standard updates should be triggered only when pilot evidence meets predeclared thresholds (e.g., ≥20% reduction in high-severity provenance errors, warning precision ≥0.90 to avoid alert fatigue, broken-link rate ≤2% at submission, and stable inter-rater reliability on audit coding κ ≥ 0.80). When thresholds are not met, the governance response is not to expand scope; it is to tighten rules, improve examples, and adjust validator severity/messaging, with every change traced in the changelog and decision log so journals and archives can confidently pin to a version and know exactly what “compliance” meant at the time of publication.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Lack of authoritative, machine-actionable crosswalks for editions/translations/variants — we do not have a definitive set of canonical identifiers, registries, or mapping rules that reliably link a cited primary text to the specific edition/translation/pagination variant. Questions: Which bibliographic authorities (e.g., OCLC/WorldCat IDs, ISBNs, ISTC, OLIDs, TEI URIs) will the community accept as authoritative? How should we represent ambiguous cases (e.g., undated reprints, mixed pagination across translations)? Are there existing crosswalk datasets (and licenses) that can be incorporated or do we need to build a curated registry?\n- Gap 2: Insufficient empirical data about the technical feasibility and performance targets for auto-detection and variant-pagination mapping — current spec assumes detection from metadata, OCR, and structural clues but lacks measured accuracy/recall benchmarks and sample corpora for training/testing. Questions: What are realistic accuracy thresholds for OCR on historical/foreign-language psychology texts, snippets, and uncommon typefaces? What labeled corpora (editions with ground-truth pagination/translation provenance) are available or need to be created, and what volume is required to validate models? Which signal hierarchy (metadata > PDF/XMP > OCR > page-image layout > repository provenance) yields the best precision in practice?\n- Gap 3: Unclear scope and legal/coverage boundaries for public-domain repository citations and governance incentives — we need clarity on jurisdictional PD status, repository selection criteria, and sustainable community governance/adoption mechanisms. Questions: Which repositories will be considered canonical (Internet Archive, HathiTrust, Gallica, Project Gutenberg, institutional repositories), and how will the spec handle paywalled copies or restricted-access mirrors? How will rights/PD assertions be represented machine-readably and verified? What incentives, maintainers, and decision-making processes will ensure ongoing curation, dispute resolution, and versioning of the protocol?\n\n\n\n\n*... and 19 more findings in memory*\n",
