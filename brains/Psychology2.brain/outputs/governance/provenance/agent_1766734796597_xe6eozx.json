      "summary": "Summary judgment\nAll three branches are broadly compatible: they describe different facets and intervention points for the same phenomenon—human cognitive error—and propose complementary remedies. The high divergence score (0.97) reflects differences in level-of-analysis (decision-process rules, perceptual-layer metaphor, lightweight metacognitive habit) rather than mutual contradiction.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Humans carry systematic, often unconscious biases that distort judgment and perception.\n- Interventions that make processes explicit (rules, externalization, checkpoints) reduce these biases.\n- Practicable, short routines (pre-mortems, brief reflective pauses, attention shifts) can improve outcomes without huge cost.\n- Measuring outcomes is important: the claim that structured interventions “measurably improve outcomes” is accepted in principle; different interventions will vary by context.\n\n2) Conflicting points (practical tensions, not deep contradictions)\n- Depth vs. cost/tradeoff:\n  - Branch 1 favors heavier, rule-based structures (pre-mortems, explicit falsification rules) that can be time- and resource-intensive but powerful for high-stakes decisions.\n  - Branch 3 favors a quick, low-friction “pause-and-note” that is scalable but may be insufficient for complex/high-risk choices.\n  Tension: when to invest in deep structure versus lightweight habit.\n- Level of intervention:\n  - Branch 2 argues for intervening at perceptual/attention layers (early-stage processing), which implies training attention, reframing, or changing information presentation.\n  - Branches 1 and 3 focus more on post-perceptual decision processes and explicit reasoning.\n  Tension: some biases originate in early sensory/attention stages and require different tools than deliberative checklists.\n- Metaphor vs. operationalization:\n  - Branch 2 is largely metaphorical (Docker/layers). It’s useful for thinking and debugging, but less directly prescriptive than Branch 1’s specific procedures. Risk: metaphor may over-simplify neural/psychological complexity if taken too literally.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions\nA practical, tiered framework: diagnose bias source → match intervention intensity → measure.\n\nA. Diagnosis phase (quick; apply Branch 2 thinking)\n- For each recurrent error, ask: does it arise primarily from perception/attention (early layer), from faulty integration/recall, or from post-hoc rationalization/confirmation bias?\n- Use simple probes: change information order, vary attention cues, or ask others to reframe the problem. This uses the “layer debugging” metaphor to locate where error is injected.\n\nB. Intervention matching\n- If error is perceptual/attention-driven: prioritize Branch 2 techniques\n  - Redesign presentation/layout, force attention shifts, use priming/reframing, brief mindfulness/attention training for teams where practical.\n- If error is integrative or reasoning-driven (confirmation bias): use Branch 1 structures\n  - Pre-mortems, explicit requirement to list disconfirming evidence, alternative-hypothesis templates, decision rules tied to data thresholds.\n- For frequent, low-to-moderate decisions and to increase uptake: use Branch 3 habit\n  - Implement a 5-minute “pause-and-note” template as a required step for medium-impact choices and as default practice in decision workflows.\n\nC. Implementation & measurement\n- Create a simple decision-type matrix mapping decision stakes/complexity to intervention intensity (e.g., low stakes = pause-and-note; medium = pause + attention reframing; high stakes = pre-mortem + disconfirmation rule).\n- Pilot: run A/B tests or before/after metrics on a few decision classes (accuracy, downstream error rate, time-to-decision, user compliance).\n- Train teams briefly on the layer model so they can diagnose source of bias, then train on the matched tools (how to run a pre-mortem, how to do a pause-and-note, simple attention-reframing exercises).\n- Bake lightweight prompts into workflows (templates, checklist integrations, calendar prompts) to raise compliance.\n\nConcise actionable checklist to start\n- Week 1: inventory 5 frequent decision types and annotate suspected error source (perceptual vs. integrative vs. confirmatory).\n- Week 2: assign intervention per the matrix (pause, attention shift, pre-mortem).\n- Weeks 3–8: run pilots with simple metrics (error rate, decision reversals, subjective confidence calibration).\n- Month 2: scale interventions that show measurable improvement; retire those that don’t.\n\nBottom line\nUse Branch 2 as the diagnostic lens to find where bias enters a process, apply Branch 1’s structured rules for high-stakes/integrative errors, and adopt Branch 3’s lightweight pause-and-note as a scalable habit for routine decisions.
