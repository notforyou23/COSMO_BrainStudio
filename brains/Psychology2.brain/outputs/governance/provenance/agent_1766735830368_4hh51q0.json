      "summary": "Summary judgment\n- Overall the three branches are largely compatible: all treat introspective reports as incomplete and endorse triangulation with objective measures. The main difference is emphasis — Branches 1 and 3 stress limits and methodological safeguards, Branch 2 proposes a constructive training mechanism (using perceptual conflicts) to improve metacognitive accuracy.\n- The high Divergence Score (0.91) reflects this emphasis split rather than fundamental contradiction.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Introspection is fallible and often misleading: people confabulate, misremember, and miss unconscious influences (Branches 1 & 3).\n- Reliable insight requires triangulation: subjective reports should be combined with objective metrics (behavioral, physiological, neural) (Branches 1 & 3).\n- Short, practical measures (e.g., think-aloud protocols, reaction time, error rates) are useful components of triangulation (Branch 3 complements Branch 1).\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Optimism vs caution: Branch 2 is optimistic that introspective/metacognitive accuracy can be improved by exposing people to systematic perceptual conflicts; Branches 1 & 3 emphasize that introspection is unreliable and recommend relying on objective triangulation rather than trusting introspective access. This is a difference of emphasis rather than a direct contradiction, but it raises two questions:\n  - Does improving metacognitive gain via perceptual conflicts produce generalizable, reliable access to underlying cognitive states, or only task‑specific calibration?\n  - Could training increase reported confidence without actually improving correspondence between reports and underlying processes (i.e., increase metacognitive bias rather than metacognitive sensitivity)?\n- Method specificity: Branch 3 proposes think-aloud as a practical tool; Branch 1 warns that subjective reports alone are insufficient. Think-aloud protocols can alter cognitive processes (reactivity) — a tension that needs mitigation.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Synthesize: combine Branches 1–3 into an empirical program: use triangulation as the baseline methodological stance, and test whether carefully designed perceptual-conflict training improves objective metacognitive sensitivity (not just confidence).\n- Pilot experiment (recommended design):\n  - Participants randomized to: (A) perceptual-conflict training (low-stakes illusions), (B) active control (neutral perceptual tasks), (C) no-training control.\n  - Pre/post measures: metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d' or type-2 AUC) across perception and decision tasks to test transfer, confidence calibration, behavioral metrics (RT, error), physiological (pupil, EEG markers if available).\n  - Include brief think-aloud on a subset of trials to capture phenomenology and check for reactivity effects; compare verbal reports against objective markers.\n  - Primary outcomes: change in metacognitive sensitivity and transfer to non-trained tasks; secondary: confidence bias, stability over time.\n- Practical safeguards:\n  - Use low-stakes, brief illusions to avoid stress or frustration.\n  - Pre-register hypotheses and analysis plan to prevent post-hoc interpretation of subjective reports.\n  - Evaluate whether improved self-reports reflect actual alignment with objective measures (sensitivity) rather than inflated confidence (bias).\n- Short-term deliverables:\n  - Run small-N pilot (n≈30/group) for feasibility and effect-size estimate.\n  - If promising, scale to powered RCT and include neural/physiological triangulation to test mechanisms.\n- If you want, I can draft a one-page pilot protocol (tasks, measures, timeline) and suggested analysis metrics (meta-d', calibration curves, mixed models)."
