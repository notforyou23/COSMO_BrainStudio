      "summary": "Summary assessment\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Task taxonomy and consistent identifiers (StudyID/EffectID/TaskID) are valuable: all branches agree they reduce ambiguity and aid aggregation/meta-analysis.\n- Semantic precision and quality control are essential: every branch notes that IDs alone are insufficient without clear operational definitions and enforcement.\n- Labels influence outcomes: there is shared recognition that labeling affects how behaviors are categorized, coded, and interpreted (framing/priming effects).\n- Need for transparency and mapping: branches converge on the importance of a public mapping between study-reported labels and taxonomy terms.\n\n2) Conflicting points\n- Neutrality of labeling: Branch 2’s stated assumption (that labeling is neutral/administrative) conflicts with its own insight and with Branches 1 & 3, which treat labels as consequential. The net evidence favors labels being non-neutral.\n- Sufficiency vs. mandate:\n  - Branch 1 implies that a standardized ID system will “meaningfully reduce” error but treats effectiveness as conditional on semantic alignment (implies voluntary/adaptive adoption may suffice).\n  - Branch 3 asserts researchers will not label consistently and therefore recommends a mandatory controlled-ID system plus mandatory mapping and a reported IRR threshold before inclusion. That is a stronger, enforcement-oriented stance than Branch 1.\n- Operational threshold and gatekeeping: Branch 3 recommends a concrete inclusion criterion (Cohen’s kappa ≥ 0.8). Branches 1 and 2 do not commit to a numerical threshold or a strict gate.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\nGoal: Gain benefits of IDs while preventing formalization of inconsistent constructs.\n\nImmediate actions (pilot phase)\n- Build a controlled taxonomy and ID scheme (StudyID/EffectID/TaskID) with precise operational definitions, examples, and boundary cases.\n- Require a public mapping table from original study labels → taxonomy terms for every coded effect.\n- Pilot on a diverse sample of studies and measure inter-rater reliability (report kappa/ICC). Use kappa as a quality indicator, not an absolute exclusion rule during piloting (target ≥ 0.8 to indicate maturity).\n- Produce a coding manual and short training module to reduce semantic ambiguity.\n\nGovernance and QA (scale-up)\n- Establish mandatory metadata fields on submission/registry platforms: taxonomy IDs and mapping table are required for inclusion in curated datasets or meta-analyses.\n- Implement automated checks (format, missing mappings) and periodic audits of mapping quality.\n- Require reporting of IRR for mappings when studies are used in pooled analyses; for high-stakes syntheses, set a pre-specified IRR threshold (e.g., ≥0.8) for inclusion or trigger re-coding.\n- Maintain versioned taxonomy, clear change logs, and a publicly accessible governance process for disputes and term evolution.\n\nTooling and incentives\n- Provide user-friendly tools (web form, API, mapping templates) and example mappings to lower adoption cost.\n- Encourage journals/funders to require taxonomy metadata on submission/registration to incentivize compliance.\n- Support retrospective harmonization efforts with curated crosswalks and documented provenance.\n\nShort rationale for this synthesis\n- IDs materially help, but only if semantic alignment, training, transparency, and quality control are enforced. A staged approach—pilot, measure IRR, then formalize mandatory reporting/gating for high-stakes uses—balances rigor and feasibility better than either “IDs alone are sufficient” or “immediately mandatory with hard cutoffs” extremes.\n\nIf you want, I can draft:\n- A one-page taxonomy template + mapping table example, or\n- A short protocol for the pilot (sample size, IRR measurement plan, decision rules)."
