      "summary": "Summary assessment (concise)\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Perception and context shape decision biases. All branches posit that sensory/perceptual processes (interoception, multisensory timing, framing) modulate motivation, attention, and thus bias (status quo, loss aversion, heuristic reliance).\n- Small, low-cost interventions can shift behavior. Branch 1’s “choice architecture” tweaks and Branch 3’s short checklist/pause are both framed as simple, scalable fixes.\n- Interventions can operate at different timescales and levels: immediate behavioral routines (checklist/pause, reframing) vs longer-term training (sensory temporal retraining).\n- The importance of measuring individual differences: Branches 1–3 each imply heterogeneity (developmental stage, interoceptive awareness, multisensory predictive coding, cognitive-load susceptibility) matters for intervention effectiveness.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Mechanistic focus: Branch 1 emphasizes contextual framing and motivational salience; Branch 2 emphasizes low-level temporal predictive coding across senses; Branch 3 emphasizes cognitive-load and metacognitive interruption. These propose different proximal mechanisms for the same outcome (biased choices).\n- Timescale and feasibility of intervention: Branch 3 recommends an immediate, low-tech habit change (60-second pause + checklist). Branch 2 proposes sensory retraining, which is plausibly longer, more resource-intensive and less proven for decision ecology. Which is preferable in practice is unclear.\n- Target populations and scope: Branch 1 asks about development (how interoception interacts with bias across age), Branch 2 targets high-stakes/time-pressured decisions (possibly adults in professional settings), Branch 3 targets general everyday decisions under load. Age and context may moderate which mechanism dominates.\n- Measurement and causal inference complexity: Interoceptive accuracy and multisensory predictive coding are harder to measure and manipulate cleanly than framing manipulations or checklists. That affects empirical tractability and speed of translation.\n- Implicit claims on generalizability: Branch 1 and 3 assume small changes generalize broadly; Branch 2 implies specificity (timing/coherence predictions) that may generalize mainly to temporal uncertainty and rapid-response settings.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (practical, prioritized)\nA. Integrative conceptual model (short-term)\n- Adopt a layered model: low-level perceptual prediction layer (interoception, multisensory timing) → intermediate attention/salience/context representation layer (choice architecture, framing) → high-level cognitive control/metacognition layer (checklists, pauses). Biases emerge from interactions across layers; interventions can target one or more layers depending on context and constraints.\n\nB. Immediate, low-cost deployments (high priority)\n- Roll out and test Branch 3-style interventions (3–5 criterion checklist + 60s pause) in everyday decision contexts and in time-pressured domains where feasible. Rationale: low cost, high feasibility, likely rapid payoff. Measure error rates, choice quality, compliance, and moderation by self-reported interoceptive awareness and multisensory timing measures.\n\nC. Targeted experimental tests to adjudicate mechanisms (research priority)\n- Lab studies testing moderation and mediation:\n  1. Measure individual differences: interoceptive accuracy (heartbeat detection), multisensory temporal binding window, and working memory/cognitive load.\n  2. Task battery: choices tapping loss aversion/status quo bias under varying framing, time pressure, and cognitive load.\n  3. Manipulations: (a) framing/sequence changes (choice architecture), (b) brief checklist/pause, (c) short sensory-temporal retraining sessions.\n  4. Outcomes: choice shifts, response times, physiological markers (HRV), error rates. Use mediation models to see whether sensory measures predict susceptibility and whether interventions act via perception, attention, or control.\n\nD. Medium-term intervention development (if evidence supports)\n- If multisensory temporal retraining reduces errors in high-stakes, time-pressured tasks (per Branch 2), develop targeted training programs for those occupations (pilots, clinicians, first responders), with randomized evaluation against checklist and choice-architecture interventions.\n- For developmental aims (Branch 1), run cross-sectional and longitudinal studies to map how interoceptive development moderates bias susceptibility, and whether age-tailored choice architectures or brief metacognitive habits produce differential benefits.\n\nE. Evaluation metrics\n- Effect sizes on unbiased choice (risk-adjusted), reduction in costly errors under time pressure, compliance/adoption rates, and moderating effects of measured perceptual traits. Cost-benefit comparisons across interventions (checklist vs training vs framing).\n\nOne-sentence practical recommendation\nStart with scalable checklist/pause and simultaneous short-term lab studies measuring interoception and multisensory timing to determine which contexts benefit from rapid behavioral fixes versus sensory retraining; escalate to targeted training only if evidence shows clear incremental benefit in high-stakes settings."
