    "mission": "Produce a detailed, mechanism-oriented plan for multi-wave randomized intervention trials that links within-child cognitive growth (executive function and processing speed) to reasoning and real-world decisions via fine-grained social support operationalizations (ZPD: type, timing, fading). The plan should specify experimental arms (nudge/choice-architecture, targeted debiasing, sleep-restoration), measurement schedules for proximal mediators and distal outcomes, causal-chain tests (mediation/moderation), and logistics needed to compare transfer and durability within the same cohorts.",
