    "mission": "Design a rigorous benchmark and continuous evaluation framework for borderline-confidence QA in the domain of psychology (cognition, behavior, development, motivation, perception, and history of psychology). Produce a focused specification that defines dataset characteristics (borderline query types, annotation schema, risk tiers, expected dispositions), evaluation metrics beyond accuracy, and TEVV-style continuous evaluation protocols plus an experimental plan to compare evidence-first pipelines, confidence-based prompting, multi-sample consistency, and verifier-model combinations.",
