      "summary": "High-level summary: all three hypotheses describe complementary mechanisms that can drive biased, persistent choices: limited cognitive control (Branch 1), reinforcing feedback loops/habit formation (Branch 2), and asymmetric valuation of losses vs gains (Branch 3). They differ mainly in which mechanism they treat as primary and in the intervention levers they prioritize.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Decisions are systematically biased away from “optimal” long-term choices.  \n- Biases can be predictable and therefore amenable to design interventions.  \n- Small, targeted changes (defaults, framing, feedback) can produce outsized durable effects because behavior is not purely deliberative.  \n- Effective interventions should be lightweight and embedded in the decision context (reduce friction, alter feedback, change presentation).\n\n2) Conflicting points (and how strong the conflict is)\n- Proximal mechanism:\n  - Branch 1 emphasizes fluctuating cognitive-control resources (stress/fatigue) that make people myopic.  \n  - Branch 2 emphasizes dynamical-system attraction: small feedback loops amplify early biases into habits.  \n  - Branch 3 emphasizes an innate value asymmetry (loss aversion) that biases choices toward risk avoidance.\n  These are not mutually exclusive mechanistic claims, but they compete in assigning explanatory primacy to different drivers. Conflict level: moderate — they predict different moderators and time-courses.\n- Intervention focus:\n  - Branch 1 prescribes reducing friction and precommitment to protect decisions when control is low.  \n  - Branch 2 prescribes perturbing feedback loops (timing, salience) to avoid convergence to maladaptive attractors.  \n  - Branch 3 prescribes reframing presentation (gains-first, concrete long-term benefits) to offset loss focus.\n  Conflict level: low-to-moderate — different levers may be more or less effective depending on context and mechanism dominance.\n- Temporal expectations:\n  - Branch 1 explains mainly acute, situation-driven myopia.  \n  - Branch 2 explains slow, path-dependent habit formation.  \n  - Branch 3 can operate both acutely (choice framing) and chronically (risk preferences).\n  Conflict level: low — they imply different temporal targets for interventions.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions\nSynthesis (concise model):\n- Integrated model: decisions result from interaction between transient control-state (stress/fatigue), feedback-driven dynamics that stabilize behavior over repeated cycles, and asymmetric valuation (loss aversion) shaping momentary choice framing. Intervention effectiveness depends on which mechanism dominates given the task, time-horizon, and individual differences.\nPractical, prioritized next actions (experiments + deployment strategy):\n1. Rapid factorial field test (micro-randomized trial)\n   - Factors: default/precommitment (on/off), feedback timing/salience (immediate vs delayed; high vs low salience), framing (loss-framed vs gain-framed vs concrete long-term numbers).\n   - Outcome: short-term choice uptake and 30–90 day persistence.\n   - Purpose: identify main effects and interactions (which levers are additive vs redundant).\n2. Laboratory validation of mechanism moderators\n   - Manipulate cognitive load/stress to test Branch 1 predictions (does precommitment/ defaults protect behavior under load?).  \n   - Test short feedback loop manipulations to probe attractor dynamics (does altering feedback timing/salience change convergence speed and stability?).  \n   - Run framing tasks to measure immediate shifts in risk-taking/loss aversion.\n3. Longitudinal habit-formation study\n   - Track behavior for several months after intervention removal to measure whether changes persisted (evidence for attractor shift) vs relapse when control resources change (evidence for resource-driven effects).\n4. Measurement & heterogeneity\n   - Collect moderators: baseline self-control, stress/fatigue proxies, prior habit strength, individual loss-aversion measure.  \n   - Pre-register primary endpoints and interaction tests.\nOperational recommendations (concise)\n- Start with combined interventions in high-friction, high-stakes contexts: implement a helpful default or precommitment, add immediate salient feedback, and use gain-focused concrete messaging. That strategy hedges across mechanisms.  \n- If constrained, prioritize defaults/precommitments when acute lapses are likely (e.g., after work, during stress), prioritize feedback-timing interventions when building long-run habits, and prioritize framing when immediate valuation distortions dominate single decisions.  \n- Evaluate durability: if gains fade once interventions stop, emphasize feedback and habit-targeting; if performance collapses under stress, prioritize structural supports (defaults, precommitments).\n\nConcise recommended experiment to run first\n- Micro-randomized field trial over 8 weeks with three orthogonal treatments (default/precommit; immediate salient feedback; gain-framed messaging). Track immediate uptake, weekly retention, and 3-month follow-up after removal. Stratify by a brief baseline measure of self-control/stress vulnerability.\n\nIf you want, I can draft a detailed experiment protocol (sample sizes, metrics, randomization plan) for the first trial."
