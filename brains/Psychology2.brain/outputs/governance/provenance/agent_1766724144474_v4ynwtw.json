      "summary": "Summary (given divergence score 0.93 — substantial disagreement across branches)\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Human behavior is strongly shaped by both fast, intuitive processes (heuristics/System 1) and time/physiological factors (motivation/reward sensitivity). All three branches accept that predictable cognitive patterns can be used to design interventions.\n- Simple, low-cost interventions can improve outcomes: prompts/delays and implementation intentions are evidence-based ways to reduce errors and increase follow-through; scheduling work to match when someone feels better/more motivated can improve productivity.\n- Combining situational scaffolds (environmental or timing changes) with psychological scaffolds (plans, prompts, brief deliberation) is a plausible route to reduce failures of self-control and judgment.\n\n2) Conflicting points (where branches diverge or possibly contradict)\n- Mechanism wording in Branch 1: it claims “interventions that slow deliberation … can markedly reduce errors.” Practically, effective interventions typically increase deliberation on specific decisions (prompting reflection, brief delay) rather than “slowing” global deliberative capacity. This is a semantic/operational inconsistency that can be misread.\n- Scope and primacy of solutions:\n  - Branch 1 emphasizes meta-cognitive prompts/delays to overcome heuristic biases.\n  - Branch 3 emphasizes precommitment/implementation intentions to counter present bias.\n  - Branch 2 prioritizes aligning tasks with biological motivation windows (circadian/dopamine peaks).\n  These are not mutually exclusive but they prioritize different levers (judgment processes vs. foresight/commitment vs. motivational timing). High divergence indicates they may recommend different first-line interventions for the same problem.\n- Practical conflict: Branch 2’s reliance on identifying a “dopamine window” assumes stable, measurable intra-day reward sensitivity; in many people this is noisy and interacts with sleep, stress, and task context. If present bias (Branch 3) or strong heuristics (Branch 1) are dominant, mere timing may be insufficient—commitment devices or prompts might still be required.\n- Implementation conflict: If you schedule demanding work for a peak window (Branch 2) but still rely on System 1 habits (Branch 1) or face powerful immediate temptations (Branch 3), productivity gains may be reduced unless combined with planning or nudges.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\nSynthesis principle: Use a hybrid, hierarchical approach — optimize when you do tasks (Branch 2) and protect those periods with precommitment plans (Branch 3) plus targeted reflective prompts for high-stakes decisions (Branch 1).\n\nPractical next steps (n-of-1 experiments you can run quickly)\n- Identify your peak window:\n  - Track for 1–2 weeks: sleep/wake times, mood/energy ratings, simple productivity metric for tasks (30–60 min blocks).\n  - Tentatively label highest-consistency blocks as “peak.”\n- Schedule: assign high-effort/creative work to those peak blocks.\n- Layer commitment: before each peak block, set simple precommitments (calendar blocks with accountability, automatic website blockers, or implementation intentions like “If I open X, then I will close it and …”).\n- Use prompts/delays for critical judgments: for decisions with evident bias risk (high stakes, irreversible), add a brief forced delay or a “why” prompt checklist to invoke deliberation.\n- Measure: compare completion, quality, and subjective difficulty across matched tasks done in peak vs non-peak windows, and with vs without commitment/prompts. Run for 2–4 weeks and iterate.\n\nWhen to favor which lever\n- If errors are judgemental and systematic (e.g., framing, anchoring): prioritize Branch 1 interventions (prompts, forced pause).\n- If failure is failure-to-start or procrastination: prioritize Branch 2 (timing) + Branch 3 (implementation intentions).\n- If temptations repeatedly derail plans: prioritize Branch 3 (commitment devices) and add timing adjustments where feasible.\n\nConcise recommendation: combine timing (schedule hard work in your physiological peaks) with precommitments that lock in behavior, and use brief reflective prompts only for high-stakes decisions. Run short, tracked experiments to validate which combination works for you."
