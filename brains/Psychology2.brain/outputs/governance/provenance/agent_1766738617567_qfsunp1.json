      "summary": "Short summary: All three branches agree that cognitive shortcuts and context matter for behavior and system design. They emphasize different levers: Branch 1 (heuristics + nudges) focuses on steering choices via small architecture changes; Branch 2 (perceptual smoothing) focuses on making systems robust to variable labels via context/prototype representations; Branch 3 (anchoring) diagnoses a particularly powerful bias and prescribes specific countermeasures. These are largely complementary, with a few tensions about stability and the best remedial strategy.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Human cognition is shortcut-driven and context-sensitive: all branches treat behavior/perception as guided by fast, context-anchored processes rather than perfect, lexical-rule-based computations.\n- Anchoring is a real, predictable effect: Branches 1 and 3 both accept anchoring as a systematic bias that influences decisions.\n- Small design/representation changes can materially change outcomes: B1’s nudges and B2’s representation choices both claim modest changes yield robust effects (in behavior or model performance).\n- Practical focus on mitigation/design: each branch proposes actionable interventions (framing/defaults, training on label variability/prototypes, anchor-countering procedures).\n\n2) Conflicting points and tensions\n- Stability vs. contextual malleability:\n  - B1 treats biases as stable and therefore reliably steerable by small changes in choice architecture without changing underlying preferences.\n  - B2 implies perceptual/category acceptance is context- and prototype-dependent, which suggests labels and responses can shift substantially with context — i.e., less “stable” than B1 implies.\n  - Tension: If categories and biases are highly context-sensitive, small nudges may have variable or transient effects.\n- Intervention framing: steer vs. debias\n  - B1 emphasizes steering behavior via choice architecture (which can exploit biases).\n  - B3 emphasizes debiasing/defensive measures (private estimates, multiple anchors) to reduce anchoring.\n  - Tension: Some interventions in B1 (deliberate framing, defaults) could be used manipulatively and might conflict with B3’s aim to protect decision quality.\n- Recommended countermeasures differ in mechanism and feasibility:\n  - B3’s “generate 3+ independent reference points, include extreme anchor” is operational but resource-intensive and may itself introduce new biases (extreme anchors can still distort).\n  - B1’s suggestion that small framing changes suffice suggests lower-cost interventions — potential mismatch about cost/benefit and reliability.\n- Applicability to automated systems:\n  - B2’s prototype/context approach applies to machine training and label robustness; B1/B3 are about humans. Applying B1/B3 techniques (nudges, private estimates) to human-in-the-loop systems must consider interaction with model outputs (e.g., model-provided anchors).\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise)\n- Synthesis (principles to adopt)\n  1. Treat biases as predictable but context-sensitive. Expect both stable tendencies (e.g., anchoring) and shifts from contextual/prototype cues. Design for both.\n  2. Use context-aware, prototype-based representations in automated systems (train on label variability, multimodal cues, prototype embeddings) to increase robustness to taxonomy drift.\n  3. When intervening on humans, decide whether the goal is steering (nudge) or improving judgment (debias). Align interventions and ethics accordingly.\n  4. Combine defensive procedures against anchoring with choice-architecture design: require private initial estimates or blind aggregation when accuracy matters; use tested defaults and framing when the goal is welfare-improving steering.\n  5. Evaluate interventions empirically — interventions interact (framing × label variability × anchoring) and effects are not strictly additive.\n\n- Concrete next actions (experiments and design checklist)\n  1. Run factorial experiments (lab or A/B) that cross:\n     - Framing/default manipulations (B1),\n     - Label variability / prototype-context training for model outputs (B2),\n     - Anchor conditions and countermeasures (B3: private estimate vs public anchors vs multiple anchors).\n     Measure decision accuracy, persistence, and user satisfaction.\n  2. For system design: augment training data with label variants and context signals; learn prototype embeddings and use soft label matching; evaluate under taxonomy drift and noisy labels.\n  3. For high-stakes decisions: require a private initial estimate or blind aggregation; present multiple independent reference points only after solicitation of private judgment; randomize order of presented numbers to reduce single-anchor dominance.\n  4. For policy/nudge deployment: pre-register ethical criteria, A/B test nudges for welfare improvements, and monitor for long-term preference changes.\n  5. Monitor interactions: specifically test whether prototype-based contextualization reduces or amplifies anchoring from model-proposed anchors.\n\nShort recommendation: Integrate B2’s representational robustness into systems, treat B1’s nudging as a calibrated tool (use only when aligned with welfare), and adopt B3’s procedural safeguards (private estimates, multiple independent anchors) whenever accuracy and unbiased judgment are priorities. Run controlled experiments to quantify interactions before large-scale rollouts."
