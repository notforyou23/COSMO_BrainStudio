      "summary": "Summary (context: Cycle 124, Divergence 0.90 — high overlap with some differences)\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All three branches endorse using fast, low-cost strategies to reduce friction under time/cognitive constraints: lightweight/existence or non-emptiness checks (Branches 1 & 2) and fast heuristics/defaults (Branch 3).\n- They all recognize the need to pair quick routines with slower, deeper processes: Branches 1 and 2 explicitly call for periodic or escalated audits; Branch 3 implies corrective feedback to counteract bias.\n- All emphasize efficiency trade-offs: accept some risk to gain speed but manage that risk through structure (audits, escalation, defaults, feedback).\n- The psychological basis is shared: human dual-process/heuristic reasoning under uncertainty explains why satisficing checks are useful and why biases must be actively mitigated.\n\n2) Conflicting points\n- Framing of verification: Branch 1 presents lightweight checks primarily as workflow accelerants that must be audited to avoid blind spots. Branch 2 frames them more explicitly as a formally-calibrated satisficing heuristic integrated with escalation rules. The tension is between “ad-hoc lightweight check + periodic audit” (Branch 1) and “integrated heuristic with calibrated stop/escalate policy” (Branch 2).\n- Emphasis on bias mitigation: Branch 3 centers on designing defaults and immediate feedback to counter cognitive biases (anchoring/availability). Branches 1–2 mention deeper audits/escalation but give less emphasis to proactively shaping defaults/feedback loops. So Branch 3 pushes a proactive behavioral-design angle missing from 1.\n- Scope of acceptance criteria: Branch 1’s “first acceptable option” risks being interpreted as a looser acceptance threshold; Branch 2 argues for explicit calibration of “when to stop.” This is a practical conflict about how strict/defined the lightweight check’s acceptance rule should be.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Adopt a hybrid policy combining Branch 2’s calibrated satisficing with Branch 3’s proactive behavioral controls, informed by Branch 1’s operational caution:\n  - Standard lightweight verifier: existence/non-emptiness + basic schema sanity checks as the default fast path.\n  - Explicit stop/escalate policy: define measurable thresholds and escalation triggers (e.g., anomaly rates, confidence metrics, change windows) so the verifier is a documented heuristic, not ad-hoc.\n  - Audit cadence & targeting: schedule periodic deeper audits and use risk-based sampling (more frequent audits for high-impact changes, new sources, or when anomaly metrics rise).\n  - Behavioral mitigations: implement well-chosen defaults, immediate actionable feedback to submitters/owners on verifier failures/successes, and visible indicators of verification confidence to counter anchoring/availability biases.\n  - Instrumentation & metrics: track false-accept and false-reject rates, time-to-fix, audit findings, and escalation frequency. Use these to recalibrate thresholds and audit cadence.\n- Short-term next steps (first 2–4 weeks):\n  1. Define the lightweight verifier spec (exact checks) and the documented stop/escalate rules.\n  2. Implement logging/metrics for verification outcomes and set initial alert thresholds.\n  3. Pilot on a subset of builds/data with scheduled audits and collect false-accept/reject rates.\n  4. Add immediate feedback UI/messages and a default action pattern for owners.\n- Medium-term (1–3 months): analyze pilot data, recalibrate thresholds, expand rollout, and formalize audit cadence driven by measured risk.\n\nRationale in one line: Use fast, documented satisficing checks to speed iteration while committing to measurable escalation and behavioral design (defaults/feedback) to control bias and avoid systematic blind spots."
