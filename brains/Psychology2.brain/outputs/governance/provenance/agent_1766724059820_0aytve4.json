        "evolutionStory": "With the information provided, the “story” of this set of documents is one of consolidation rather than iterative revision.\n\n## What we can infer from the metadata you provided\n\n### 1) There’s no detectable version lineage\n- **Version Chains: 0** means none of the three documents is identified as a revision of another (no parent/child succession, no “v2 of v1”).\n- Historically, this suggests one of two common scenarios:\n  1) the documents were authored independently, or  \n  2) they *are* related in reality, but the signals used to detect lineage (shared IDs, filenames, tracked changes history, strong text overlap) aren’t present or weren’t captured.\n\n### 2) There are no explicit cross-document ties\n- **Relationships: 0** indicates the system doesn’t see citations, references, shared sections, or structural linking between the documents.\n- This often happens when documents are:\n  - stand-alone memos/policies that cover adjacent topics without referencing each other, or\n  - derived from the same source material but rewritten enough that automated relationship detection doesn’t register the connection.\n\n### 3) The collection got shorter over time (net -520 words)\n- The only concrete directional signal is the **net contraction of 520 words** from the earliest to the latest “version” (here meaning “earliest-to-latest in time,” not a formal revision chain).\n- In document history, a shrink like this typically reflects one (or more) of these editorial moves:\n  - **de-duplication** (removing repeated background, boilerplate, or restated rationale),\n  - **tightening** (cutting hedging language, examples, or extended explanations),\n  - **scope narrowing** (dropping a section that no longer applied—e.g., implementation detail, exceptions, or legacy context),\n  - **standardization** (aligning to a template that is shorter than the original narrative format).\n\n## A plausible narrative of the evolution\n\nEarly in the timeline, the collection likely began in a more expansive form—documents that carried more context, fuller explanations, or overlapping material (even if not explicitly linked). As time progressed, the set appears to have been **pared down**, leaving later documents more compact. Rather than a clean “draft → revision → final” sequence, the editorial history looks like **parallel artifacts** where the most visible long-term change is **compression**: material was removed or folded away, but not in a way that preserved traceable ancestry between files.\n\nIn other words, the collection’s evolution reads less like a family tree and more like a **pruning process**: content was reduced across the set, but the record does not show which document(s) donated language to which, or which replaced which.\n\n## What’s missing (and what would let me tell a sharper story)\nTo describe *key changes over time* beyond “it got shorter,” I’d need at least one of the following:\n- timestamps per document,\n- titles/filenames,\n- the actual text (or diffs),\n- any known intended workflow (e.g., “Doc B replaced Doc A”).\n\nIf you share the three documents (or even just their headings/section lists), I can reconstruct a more specific documentary history: what was cut (definitions, procedures, background), whether any text migrated between documents, and which document appears to be the “consolidated” endpoint that accounts for the -520 word shift.",

Prioritize seminal works, meta-analyses, recent high-impact reviews (last 10 years), and historical primary sources (e.g., works by Wundt, James, Piaget, Skinner, Freud, Lewin).\n**Completed:** 2025-12-26T04:38:35.405Z\n\n## Summary\n\nThe collected findings cluster into three complementary strands: (1) access to psychology’s historical primary sources, (2) meta-analytic evidence on cognition/affect and decision performance, and (3) contemporary longitudinal approaches that update classic developmental debates (Piaget–Vygotsky) with growth-model methods and mechanistic constructs (e.g., executive function, processing speed).\n\nHistorically, the workflow emphasis is practical and source-critical: begin with stable, openly hosted primary texts (e.g., PsychClassics, Project Gutenberg), then verify edition/translation provenance before quoting or page-citing—especially for works originally published in German or French. In parallel, the modern evidence base on decision-making suggests modest average effects with substantial heterogeneity: reflective thinking predicts slightly better normative performance, sleep restriction reliably harms neurocognitive functioning relevant to decisions, and emotion/context (e.g., anxiety) meaningfully shifts risk-related judgments. Intervention syntheses indicate that “nudges” can produce small-to-medium behavior change on average, whereas debiasing training tends to yield smaller improvements with limited transfer beyond trained contexts.\n\nDevelopmentally, recent longitudinal research reframes stage-like interpretations into continuous, multi-wave models where within-child change in information-processing and executive function predicts later higher-order outcomes (e.g., reasoning). Cultural-historical (Vygotskian) reviews stress conceptual precision—particularly distinguishing ZPD from generic “scaffolding”—and call for better operationalization of social support (type, timing, fading), aligning theory with intervention-relevant measurement.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n1. Primary-source access finding: High-utility repositories (e.g., York University’s PsychClassics; Project Gutenberg) provide full-text access to seminal works (e.g., Wundt, James, Watson), but accurate scholarly use often requires triangulating edition and translation details before quotation/page citation—especially for non-English originals.\n\n2. Cognition–decision performance finding (meta-analytic): Reflective thinking shows a modest positive association with normatively correct decision performance (approximately r≈.11 across 89 samples; N≈17,700), while intuitive thinking shows a modest negative association (approximately r≈−.09), with effects varying by task type, time pressure, and sample characteristics.\n\n3. Cognitive resource constraint finding (meta-analytic): Experimentally manipulated sleep restriction has a reliable negative effect on neurocognitive functioning relevant to decision quality (overall approximately g≈−0.38), including executive functioning and sustained attention.\n\n4. Affect–risk finding (meta-analytic): Fear/anxiety is associated with decreased risk taking and increased risk estimation (average approximately r≈0.22) but with high heterogeneity and stronger effects in tasks with tangible outcomes and in clinically anxious samples—indicating strong state- and task-dependence.\n\n5. Intervention effectiveness finding (meta-analytic): Choice-architecture nudges show an overall small-to-medium behavior-change effect (approximately d≈0.45; 200+ studies; 450+ effect sizes; n>2 million), with larger effects for decision-structure changes (e.g., defaults) than for re-description-only interventions; debiasing training in educational settings shows smaller improvements (approximately g≈0.26) with concerns about study quality and limited evidence of broad transfer.\n\n## Research Queries\n\n1. seminal works history of psychology primary sources\n2. meta-analysis cognition and decision-making 2015-2025\n3. developmental psychology Piaget Vygotsky longitudinal studies review\n\n## Sources\n\nTotal sources consulted: 106\n\nSee `bibliography.bib` for citation-ready BibTeX entries.\n",
