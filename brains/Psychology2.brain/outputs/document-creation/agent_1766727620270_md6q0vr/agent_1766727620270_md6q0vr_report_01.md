5. [CONSOLIDATED] Robust task-taxonomy and annotation work should ship as a coherent package—explicit codebook, machine-readable schema, concrete examples, and automated validators/tests—so labels are consistently applied and constraints are enforceable end-to-end.

6. How does cultural memory of past psychological theories (e.g., behaviorism vs. the cognitive revolution) shape contemporary individual decision-making biases and which heuristics are socially reinforced? Insight: Collective narratives about the history of psychology can prime which mental models and motivations are taught and trusted, subtly steering perception, learning, and policy preferences across generations.

7. Motivation: aligning demanding tasks with an individual's circadian-driven dopamine peaks—rather than arbitrary clock hours—can substantially boost intrinsic motivation and reduce procrastination, because reward sensitivity fluctuates predictably across the day. Practically, this means scheduling creative or high-effort work during your personal "dopamine window" (learned from sleep/wake patterns and mood tracking) yields bigger productivity gains than equal time allotted at mismatched times.

8. [CONSOLIDATED] Iterative feedback cycles tend to increase cognitive consistency by repeatedly reinforcing and stabilizing belief–action patterns, but whether they reduce bias or entrench it depends on feedback quality—diverse, timely, and disconfirming signals promote incremental belief updating, while selective or confirmatory feedback fosters echo chambers, overconfidence, and motivated reasoning that resists contradictory evidence.
