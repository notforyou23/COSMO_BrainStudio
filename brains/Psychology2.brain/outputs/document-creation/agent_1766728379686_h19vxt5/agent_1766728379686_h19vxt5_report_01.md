1. [CONSOLIDATED] Build a reproducible meta-analysis “starter kit” that standardizes inputs (templates/schemas), runs an automated end-to-end placeholder analysis from a single entrypoint, and produces validated outputs (tables/plots) with comprehensive, timestamped logs and manifests for traceability.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Build data-processing/research workflows as reproducible, automatable systems by standardizing inputs with explicit schemas/IDs, enforcing quality gates (validation, checksums, tests), and preserving traceability through consistent CLIs/APIs, logging, and provenance-aware storage.

3. [CONSOLIDATED] Robust, reusable research workflows come from formalizing the work into explicit schemas/codebooks with enforced validation and provenance-aware tooling, then running a single reproducible pipeline that generates standardized outputs plus auditable logs (e.g., timestamps, paths, checksums) to make analyses and annotations consistent, traceable, and repeatable.

4. [CONSOLIDATED] Standardize build verification by running the required validation tools against the current artifacts and persist both raw console output and structured run metadata (versions, inputs, outputs, exit codes) in a timestamped log directory for reproducibility and traceability.

1. [AGENT: agent_1766723822731_qlsh7fi] Cycle 1 consistency review (divergence 0.94):
Summary verdict: The three branches are largely complementary — they describe distinct mechanisms (cognitive heuristics, gut-brain biology, and action-planning) that can each influence real-world choice and procrastination — but they imply different loci for intervention (choice architecture vs. biological modulation vs. individual planning), which creates tensions about what “works” and why. Below are agreements, specific conflicts, and a recommended synthesis and next actions.

1) Areas of agreement
- All three treat choice outcomes as malleable: behavior is not fixed; interventions can shift decisions without assuming wholesale changes to deep preferences.
- Interventions can be low-cost and scalable (choice architecture tweaks, implementation intentions, dietary/probiotic changes).
- Mechanisms operate by changing proximate processes that shape choice (perception/attention/valuation/timing of action), so mediators should be targeted and measured.
- Experimental evaluation is needed: randomized tests with behavioral outcomes and mediators (e.g., time perception, response latency, compliance).
- Multi-level approaches are plausible: environmental design and individual strategies can be combined.

2) Conflicting points (mechanism and intervention focus)
- Locus of change
  - Branch 1: Changes should target external choice environments (defaults, framing) and assumes biases are cognitive processing shortcuts that persist unless environments are restructured.
  - Branch 2: Emphasizes

14. Motivation: aligning demanding tasks with an individual's circadian-driven dopamine peaks—rather than arbitrary clock hours—can substantially boost intrinsic motivation and reduce procrastination, because reward sensitivity fluctuates predictably across the day. Practically, this means scheduling creative or high-effort work during your personal "dopamine window" (learned from sleep/wake patterns and mood tracking) yields bigger productivity gains than equal time allotted at mismatched times.

15. [FORK:fork_3] A major limitation is that decision‑making research often relies on simplified lab tasks that lack ecological validity and real‑world incentives, limiting generalizability. To address this, embed naturalistic, incentivized decision tasks into longitudinal, sensor‑assisted field studies (e.g., mobile apps with real rewards) to capture richer, context‑dependent behavior.
