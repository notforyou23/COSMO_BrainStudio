3. [FORK:fork_34] Design atomic-claims as minimal, self-contained propositions with explicit subject, predicate, scope, and required provenance fields (source, timestamp, extraction method) and provide a rubric that defines each label with positive/negative examples, concrete edge-case rules, and a calibrated confidence scale for borderline cases. Key limitation: despite tight specs, claim boundary choices and nuance remain subjective, so expect systematic annotator disagreement that must be managed with adjudication, ongoing calibration, and inter-annotator agreement monitoring.

4. [FORK:fork_35] Under cognitive load people shift toward simple heuristics and default options, speeding decisions but increasing reliance on shortcuts. A key limitation is that this tendency raises systematic bias and error, and lab-based findings may overstate effects compared with complex real-world choices.

17. [FORK_RESULT:fork_8] Introspection is a fallible metacognitive process: people’s subjective reports often misrepresent their own mental states because limited access to unconscious processes, cognitive biases, and confabulation distort or fill gaps. To improve self-knowledge, treat introspective judgments as tentative and corroborate them with external feedback or behavioral measures (e.g., track decisions and outcomes, solicit others’ observations).

18. [FORK:fork_15] Fast, heuristic-driven decisions are like a city's shortcut lanes: they sacrifice exhaustive accuracy for speed, letting us navigate complexity by following learned patterns. That trade-off becomes powerful when we design environments (interfaces, cities, routines) that tune those shortcuts toward better outcomes—so small structural nudges rewire instinctive choices at scale.

20. [FORK:fork_16] Treating introspection as a Bayesian observer means self-reports are posterior estimates that combine noisy internal evidence (likelihood) with prior beliefs, so many introspective biases (overconfidence, anchoring) are predictable consequences of strong priors or high measurement noise. Therefore improving self-knowledge requires shifting priors or enhancing internal signal quality (feedback, calibration), not assuming introspection is inherently reliable.
