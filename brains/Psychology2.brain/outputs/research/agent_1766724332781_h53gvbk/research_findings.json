      "content": "Content-only “AI detectors” for text/images remain unreliable and easy to evade; stronger signals come from generation-time watermarking and first-party detectors within a vendor ecosystem (e.g., SynthID; Reuters-reported OpenAI plans for DALL·E 3 detection), but these are not universal and work best when the content carries the vendor’s embedded/provenance data.",

  "summary": "For borderline-confidence model outputs, the most reliable verification pattern is to (1) force the system to surface evidence and (2) add a decision layer that can abstain when support is weak. Concretely, teams operationalize this via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with explicit citations and claim-level verification: decompose responses into atomic claims, retrieve supporting passages from a trusted corpus, and label each claim as supported/contradicted/not-found. This “verify before ship” workflow aligns with guardrail-style hallucination checks and can be thresholded to route uncertain/high-impact claims to human review.\n\nSeparately, “fact-checking” in 2024 increasingly emphasized provenance and first-party signals rather than generic content-only detectors. C2PA Content Credentials (with a notable v2.0 spec update in Jan 2024) provide signed metadata describing creation/edit history that can be verified, and major ecosystem/tooling efforts (e.g., verifier implementations) support inspection. Watermarking plus first-party detection (e.g., vendor-embedded signals such as SynthID; reported plans for DALL·E 3 detection) complements provenance. Across modalities, research cautions that pixel/text-only AI detectors remain brittle and adversarially evadable, so risk controls should prefer provenance, cryptographic metadata, and workflow-based verification.\n\nFinally, uncertainty quantification (UQ) best practice is less about a single “confidence score” and more about calibration + decision-focused evaluation (risk–coverage / selective prediction). Practical deployments often combine sampling/consistency signals or token-probability signals (when available) with an abstention threshold; conformal and selective prediction methods add statistically grounded “answer vs defer” behavior under assumptions (e.g., exchangeability) and require in-domain recalibration when prompts, tools, or retrieval corpora change.",
  "successAssessment": "Criteria 1 (complete handoff): Met—this synthesis consolidates the parent agent’s three query areas (borderline-claim verification, 2024 fact-checking/provenance, and LLM UQ) into a coherent set of recommended practices. Criteria 2 (build upon findings): Met—connections are made across threads (evidence + abstention + calibration; provenance vs detector brittleness) and translated into a unified workflow. Criteria 3 (actionable results): Mostly met—outputs specify implementable controls (claim decomposition + retrieval evidence scoring, selective abstention thresholds, calibration/risk–coverage evaluation, provenance/C2PA adoption). Remaining gap: several adoption claims (e.g., specific vendor rollouts or detector performance) rely on secondary reporting or point-in-time announcements; for high-stakes use, these should be independently verified in your environment (e.g., validate C2PA end-to-end in your media pipeline; benchmark UQ/abstention thresholds on your in-domain prompts and corpus; red-team detector robustness).",
