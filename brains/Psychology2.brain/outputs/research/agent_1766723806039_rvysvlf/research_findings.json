  "mission": "Conduct a comprehensive literature search across peer-reviewed journals, classic texts, and reputable books/websites to collect primary sources and authoritative secondary sources on: cognition, behavior, perception, development, motivation, decision-making, and the history of psychology. Prioritize seminal works, meta-analyses, recent high-impact reviews (last 10 years), and historical primary sources (e.g., works by Wundt, James, Piaget, Skinner, Freud, Lewin).",

  "summary": "The collected findings cluster into three complementary strands: (1) access to psychology’s historical primary sources, (2) meta-analytic evidence on cognition/affect and decision performance, and (3) contemporary longitudinal approaches that update classic developmental debates (Piaget–Vygotsky) with growth-model methods and mechanistic constructs (e.g., executive function, processing speed).\n\nHistorically, the workflow emphasis is practical and source-critical: begin with stable, openly hosted primary texts (e.g., PsychClassics, Project Gutenberg), then verify edition/translation provenance before quoting or page-citing—especially for works originally published in German or French. In parallel, the modern evidence base on decision-making suggests modest average effects with substantial heterogeneity: reflective thinking predicts slightly better normative performance, sleep restriction reliably harms neurocognitive functioning relevant to decisions, and emotion/context (e.g., anxiety) meaningfully shifts risk-related judgments. Intervention syntheses indicate that “nudges” can produce small-to-medium behavior change on average, whereas debiasing training tends to yield smaller improvements with limited transfer beyond trained contexts.\n\nDevelopmentally, recent longitudinal research reframes stage-like interpretations into continuous, multi-wave models where within-child change in information-processing and executive function predicts later higher-order outcomes (e.g., reasoning). Cultural-historical (Vygotskian) reviews stress conceptual precision—particularly distinguishing ZPD from generic “scaffolding”—and call for better operationalization of social support (type, timing, fading), aligning theory with intervention-relevant measurement.",
  "successAssessment": "The success criteria were not met. The work produced a small set of relevant sources and credible, specific meta-analytic effect-size summaries plus several classic primary-source pointers, but it did not create the required annotated bibliography (minimum 30 sources) in APA style, did not provide 150–300 word annotations with tags for domain/method/level of evidence, and did not save outputs to runtime/outputs/annotated_bibliography.json and runtime/outputs/annotated_bibliography.md. Coverage is also incomplete relative to the mission (e.g., perception, motivation, broader behavior/development subareas, and a fuller set of historical figures like Freud, Lewin, Pavlov, Piaget primary texts). To meet the criteria, the next step would be a structured literature expansion (seeded by these meta-analyses and classics), followed by standardized APA entries, annotations, tagging, and export to the specified files.",
