      "content": "For statistical claim verification, the reliable path is to find primary producing agencies/datasets using targeted search (e.g., `site:.gov`/`site:.edu` plus methodology/documentation terms), then cite dataset landing pages/tables with identifiers, release/vintage dates, geography, and methodology notes (e.g., data.census.gov’s built-in citation tools and Census citation guidance).",

  "summary": "Borderline-confidence QA outputs should be handled as a selective prediction and risk-management problem, not as a prompt to the model to “be more sure.” The most reliable operational pattern is to require verifiable support for answers (grounded in retrieved evidence with attribution) and otherwise abstain or defer to a human or a slower verification pipeline. This aligns with NIST’s AI RMF / GenAI profile and TEVV framing: calibrate, test in-context, and measure failure modes continuously.\n\nPractically, teams combine evidence-first verification (retrieve-then-verify, claim-by-claim checking, and strict citation requirements) with robustness checks (multi-sample consistency, verifier models, rule-based constraint checks). When integrating external “fact-checking APIs,” the current ecosystem primarily supports (a) retrieval of existing published fact-checks via ClaimReview feeds (notably Google Fact Check Tools API) and (b) workflow automation such as claim spotting/triage (e.g., ClaimBuster) and review operations tooling (e.g., Meedan’s Check). For statistical claims, best practice is to locate and cite primary datasets/tables (often via `site:.gov` and `site:.edu` query patterns and tools like data.census.gov’s citation workflow), capturing dataset/table identifiers, vintage, and methodology notes.",
  "successAssessment": "The handoff was completed by converting the parent agent’s collected sources into a concrete, operational synthesis focused on borderline-confidence QA verification. The response builds directly on the provided findings by (a) translating them into a clear decision/workflow model (selective prediction + abstention), (b) enumerating specific verification techniques to implement, and (c) clarifying what external ‘fact-checking APIs’ realistically provide and how to combine them in a pipeline. The results are actionable (thresholding, grounding requirements, claim decomposition, consistency/verifier checks, and primary-source search/citation templates), meeting the success criteria well; the main remaining gap is that no domain-specific acceptance thresholds or KPIs were quantified, which would require product context and evaluation data.",
