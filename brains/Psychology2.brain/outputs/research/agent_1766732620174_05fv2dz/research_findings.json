  "summary": "Across psychology primary-source scholarship (empirical articles, datasets, instruments, interviews, lab notes), the core metadata challenge is practical interoperability: making materials findable, citable, and reusable across library catalogs, repositories, and lab workflows. The research indicates a complementary “stack” of standards: Dublin Core for cross-domain discovery metadata, TEI for richly structured document-level encoding and provenance (especially for textual/historical sources), and CRediT for transparent attribution of contributor roles across articles and associated outputs (data/code/materials).\n\nFor public-domain historical psychology texts, the most actionable infrastructure insight is that page-level, stable citation anchors depend heavily on the hosting platform. HathiTrust and the Internet Archive provide workable page-addressing patterns (e.g., HathiTrust page sequence parameters; Internet Archive page viewer URLs and IIIF endpoints). However, licensing and reuse constraints can differ from underlying public-domain status—especially for Google-digitized scans in HathiTrust—so citation and reuse tooling needs to capture not just “PD” but scan provenance and terms.\n\nFinally, the landscape of verification research is converging on measurable audits and scalable, machine-assisted checking. Citation/quotation error rates in historical scholarship are empirically nontrivial, and reproducibility audits in psychology show that open data alone often fails to guarantee analytic reproducibility. Emerging datasets and systems for citation verification and citation-context labeling suggest a path to linking claim–citation checking with reproducibility signals.",
  "successAssessment": "Partially met. Criterion (4) is the strongest: the research surfaced at least five exemplar audit/reproducibility resources or studies (history quotation-error audit; a 2025 medical quotation-inaccuracy meta-analysis as a benchmark; a reproducibility audit of Psychological Science open-data badge papers; the 2024 Replication Database; and a study linking failed replications to citation decline), plus additional AI-oriented citation-verification datasets (SemanticCite, CC30k).\n\nCriteria (1)–(3) were not met. Only three standards/frameworks were identified (TEI, Dublin Core, CRediT), short of the requested inventory of 8+ with annotations. Repository coverage is narrow (primarily HathiTrust and Internet Archive, with brief mention of Project Gutenberg) and does not reach 6–10 services nor fully map stable identifier granularity across them. No prioritized 15–25 item checklist of edition/translation provenance and variant-numbering issues was produced, and no concrete set of 5 psychology-literature examples demonstrating those edition/translation/numbering pitfalls was compiled. Next steps to meet the mission would be to (a) expand standards to include MODS, MARC, DataCite, schema.org, PROV-O, IIIF Presentation, CSL/Citeproc, Crossref/DOI metadata, ORCID/ROR, etc.; (b) extend repositories to PsychClassics, Project Gutenberg, Gallica, Google Books, Wikisource, PubMed Central, JSTOR, Zenodo/OSF (for modern primary artifacts), and map page/paragraph anchors; and (c) build the requested provenance/variant checklist with psychology-specific worked examples (e.g., translated editions of Freud, James, Wundt, Piaget; test manual editions; shifting chapter/section numbering; OCR vs facsimile pagination; reprints with altered page breaks).",
