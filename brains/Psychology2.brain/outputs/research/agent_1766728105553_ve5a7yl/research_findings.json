  "summary": "The research indicates that “primary-source scholarship in psychology” is best supported not by a psychology-specific metadata standard, but by a layered, interoperable stack. In practice, discovery metadata (Dublin Core or MODS) is complemented by archival hierarchy (EAD3), object packaging/structure for multi-file digitized items (METS, including the newly released METS 2 in 2025), and preservation/technical metadata (PREMIS plus NISO MIX for images). For text-centric sources (letters, notebooks, transcripts), TEI P5 remains a robust edition/encoding ecosystem, with TEI CMIF as a pragmatic profile for correspondence. For psychology primary sources that are actually research outputs (datasets, instruments, questionnaires), DDI Lifecycle (3.3) and the newer DDI-CDI (2025) address richer cross-domain interoperability needs.\n\nRepository practices most relevant to reproducibility and citation center on stable identifiers and explicit rights signals. HathiTrust emphasizes a volume identifier (htid) plus persistent Handle URLs and conservative rights codes; Internet Archive uses a per-item identifier but often relies on uploader-declared rights, implying higher verification burden; Gallica consistently exposes ARK identifiers and has clear reuse framing (attribution required, commercial reuse often licensed), with metadata under France’s Open Licence (Etalab) and source/retrieval-date expectations. Tooling trends suggest that lightweight protocol/tool design should lean on established citation/rendering infrastructures (CSL + citeproc) and proven “plugin surfaces” (COinS/OpenURL, Zotero integrations), while monitoring emerging provenance standards like C2PA for cryptographically verifiable media provenance rather than reinventing provenance from scratch.",
  "successAssessment": "Criterion 1 (≥8 metadata standards/schemas): Met. Standards/schemas evidenced include Dublin Core, MODS, EAD3, METS (and METS 2), PREMIS, NISO MIX, TEI P5, TEI CMIF, DDI Lifecycle 3.3, and DDI-CDI v1.0—each directly applicable to describing, structuring, preserving, editing, or exchanging psychology-relevant primary sources.\n\nCriterion 2 (≥6 repositories with URLs + identifier/licence notes): Partially met. The research provides detailed identifier and rights/licensing notes for three high-yield repositories—HathiTrust (htid + Handle; rights codes), Internet Archive (item identifier; uploader-declared rights), and Gallica (ARK; reuse conditions + Etalab metadata licence). Additional repositories named in the mission (e.g., PsychClassics, Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive already covered, plus others like Wikimedia Commons, Europeana, BHL, Open Library, institutional archives) were not inventoried in the collected findings and would need follow-on compilation to reach six with comparable detail.\n\nCriterion 3 (≥5 tools/plugins/pipelines for provenance/variant detection or citation normalization): Met. Covered candidates include C2PA/Content Credentials (cryptographic media provenance), SemanticCite (prototype citation-claim support classification), CSL + citeproc engines (citation rendering backbone), JabRef CSL integration for LibreOffice (authoring workflow), z2csl (Zotero↔CSL field mapping normalization), Omeka COinS (OpenURL metadata embedding for Zotero capture), Omeka Zotero Import (library-to-exhibit ingestion), TEI Publisher (single-source TEI publishing), and EVT (TEI-oriented edition visualization). Limitation patterns noted: provenance standards depend on upstream adoption (credentials must be present), and repository rights signals (esp. IA) may be unreliable without independent verification.\n\nCriterion 4 (gap analysis ≤300 words + ≥4 stakeholder groups): Partially met from the available evidence; below is a concise gap analysis and stakeholder list that logically follows the findings but would benefit from targeted validation interviews.\n\nGap analysis (≤300 words): (1) Rights/licensing ambiguity remains a major technical blocker for reuse and reproducibility: IA’s uploader-declared signals and differing “PD reproduction” reuse policies (e.g., Gallica commercial constraints) require a rights-verification and citation-note convention that can travel with exported metadata. (2) Crosswalking gaps persist between archival/edition stacks (EAD/METS/TEI/PREMIS) and citation stacks (CSL/COinS/Zotero), causing loss of provenance details (scan source, manifest, page image references, OCR/transcription lineage) in typical bibliographic exports. (3) Provenance tooling is bifurcating: cryptographic media provenance (C2PA) is promising but adoption-dependent, while semantic citation-checking prototypes are not yet integrated into everyday edition/repository workflows; a lightweight tool should prioritize capture of verifiable identifiers (htid/Handle/ARK/IA ID), retrieval dates, and transformation steps in a simple, exportable record.\n\nPrioritized stakeholder groups for endorsement: (1) Digital library/repository operators (HathiTrust, IA, BnF/Gallica, institutional repositories) to align identifier/rights and export fields; (2) Metadata and digital-preservation communities (LoC/METS-PREMIS groups, DDI Alliance, TEI Consortium) for schema alignment and profiles; (3) Reference-manager/citation infrastructure maintainers (CSL community, Zotero/JabRef ecosystems, Omeka plugin maintainers) to ensure capture/export interoperability; (4) History of psychology and archival user communities (societies, research libraries, special collections curators, digital edition editors) to validate required provenance fields and citation heuristics.",
