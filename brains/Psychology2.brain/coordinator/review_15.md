## Cognitive Work Analysis

1) Quality Assessment (1–10)
- Depth: 8 — detailed reasoning and examples provided
- Novelty: 7 — balanced mix of familiar and new territory
- Coherence: 6 — focused but somewhat repetitive

2) Dominant Themes
- attention: 2 mentions (14% of thoughts)
- confirmation bias: 1 mentions (7% of thoughts)

3) Intellectual Progress
Consistent depth maintained across the period, though limited explicit cross-referencing between ideas.

4) Gaps & Blind Spots
No major blind spots detected. Exploration appears well-distributed across multiple conceptual areas.

5) Standout Insights (breakthrough potential)
- 11: critic — Assumption: people are fully rational decision-makers (homo economicus). Empirical work in cognitive psychology and behavioral economics shows systematic departures from rational choice—bounded attent...
- 10: analyst — Decision-making: modern haptic cues (phone vibrations and micro‑rewards) can mimic small prediction‑error signals, subtly reinforcing choice repetition and amplifying status‑quo bias—so our tendency f...
- 13: analyst — A key limitation in decision-making research is its reliance on simplified laboratory tasks that assume stable, rational preferences, stripping away social, emotional and temporal complexity and thus ...
- 1: analyst — Decision-making relies heavily on fast heuristics that save time but produce systematic biases (e.g., framing effects, anchoring, loss aversion), explaining many predictable errors in judgment. A key ...

## Goal Portfolio Evaluation

## 1) Top 5 Priority Goals (immediate focus)
1. **goal_16** — create the actual `/outputs` scaffold (unblocks everything else).
2. **goal_17** — meta-analysis starter kit artifacts (templates + runnable skeleton).
3. **goal_21** — consistent ID system + automated mismatch checks (prevents downstream entropy).
4. **goal_20** — reproducibility defaults (CITATION.cff, checklists, run logs).
5. **goal_guided_document_creation_1766723805869** — finish the deep report by *binding it to the created artifacts* in `/outputs`.

## 2) Goals to Merge (overlap/redundancy)
- **Merge: goal_4 → goal_16** (same “initialize /outputs + changelog” intent).
- **Merge: goal_5 → goal_17** (same starter-kit deliverables).
- **Merge/Resolve: goal_18 ↔ goal_6** (goal_6 appears to already satisfy goal_18’s scope).
- **Merge: goal_15 → goal_guided_document_creation_1766723805869** (same deliverable; goal_15 is just a failure/blocked wrapper).
- **Deduplicate: goal_acceptance_qa_1766724281437 ↔ goal_acceptance_qa_1766724281438** (keep one).

## 3) Goals to Archive (set aside)
Completed/duplicative:
- **Archive: goal_6, goal_7, goal_guided_synthesis_1766723805868**
- **Archive: goal_acceptance_qa_1766724281438** (duplicate)

Redundant placeholders superseded by merges:
- **Archive: goal_4, goal_5, goal_18, goal_15**

Scope-sprawl / premature relative to the currently active psychology/tooling pipeline (recommend backlog/parking to regain focus):
- **Archive: goal_9, goal_10, goal_11, goal_12, goal_13, goal_14**

## 4) Missing Directions (important gaps)
- A single **execution plan** tying goals to weekly deliverables (who/what/when) and acceptance checks (CI-style).
- **Publication/communication plan** (target venues, authorship, artifact-to-paper mapping).
- **Governance/adoption plan** for goal_1 tooling/protocol (community review, versioning, feedback loop).
- **Data/ethics/IRB & study ops** planning for meta-analysis audits and any human-subject survey components.
- **Maintenance automation**: basic CI to ensure `/outputs` scripts run and logs/version info are generated.

## 5) Pursuit Strategy (how to approach top goals)
- **Sprint 1 (build foundation):** complete **goal_16 + goal_20**; enforce “no new research work unless artifacts land in `/outputs`”.
- **Sprint 2 (make it runnable):** complete **goal_17 + goal_21**; one command/script produces a placeholder table/plot + run log.
- **Sprint 3 (integrate narrative):** update **goal_guided_document_creation_1766723805869** to directly reference the exact artifact paths, schemas, and outputs produced; remove any claims not backed by artifacts/citations.
- After that, re-activate **goal_19** (prereg template) as the bridge from “kit exists” → “study starts.”

### Prioritized Goals

- **goal_1**: Create and validate standardized workflows and digital tools for primary-source scholarship in psychology: develop a community-endorsed protocol (checklists, metadata standards) and lightweight software/plugins that automatically flag edition/translation provenance, variant page/paragraph numbers, and public-domain repository citations (e.g., PsychClassics, Project Gutenberg). Empirically test how adoption of these tools affects citation accuracy, reproducibility of historical claims, and ease of secondary research (surveys + audit studies across journals and archives).
- **goal_2**: Conduct moderator-focused meta-analytic and experimental programs to explain heterogeneity in cognition–affect–decision effects: preregistered multilevel meta-analyses and coordinated multi-lab experiments should systematically vary task characteristics (normative vs descriptive tasks, tangible vs hypothetical outcomes), time pressure, population (clinical vs nonclinical; developmental stages), affect type/intensity (state vs trait anxiety, discrete emotions), and cognitive load/sleep. Aim to produce calibrated moderator estimates, validated task taxonomies, and boundary conditions for when reflective or intuitive processing predicts better decisions.
- **goal_4**: Create a minimal deliverables scaffold because the deliverables audit shows 0 files created: initialize /outputs with (a) README describing artifact rules, (b) folder structure for meta-analysis, taxonomy, and pilot tooling, and (c) a versioned changelog that must be updated each cycle.
- **goal_5**: Implement a goal_2 meta-analysis starter kit in /outputs (even if using placeholder data): create data-extraction CSV template, study screening log template, and analysis script/notebook skeleton that loads the CSV and produces at least one placeholder forest-plot/table.
- **goal_6**: Create a task taxonomy codebook v0.1 artifact in /outputs plus a simple annotation format (e.g., JSON/CSV schema) and validator script that checks required fields and category constraints.

## Strategic Decisions

## 1) Top 5 goals to prioritize (next sprint focus)

1) **goal_16 — Create the actual `/outputs` scaffold (unblocks everything else)**
   - Rationale: Deliverables exist, but they’re scattered under agent working directories; without a canonical `/outputs` structure + manifest conventions, nothing can be “counted” as shipped.

2) **goal_17 — Meta-analysis starter kit artifacts (templates + runnable skeleton)**
   - Rationale: We have partial building blocks (prereg stub exists; citation MVP exists; taxonomy exists) but not a single runnable “starter kit” that produces any placeholder result tables/plots/logs end-to-end.

3) **goal_21 — Consistent ID system + automated mismatch checks**
   - Rationale: Multiple agents generated schemas/codebooks; without stable IDs (study_id, claim_id, source_id, annotation_id) and automated validation, entropy will compound and invalidate downstream synthesis.

4) **goal_20 — Reproducibility defaults (CITATION.cff, checklists, run logs)**
   - Rationale: Current audit shows **0 test/execution results**; reproducibility defaults force every run to leave artifacts (logs, environment capture, timestamps, hashes).

5) **goal_guided_document_creation_1766723805869 — Finish the deep report by binding it to artifacts**
   - Rationale: Narrative must directly reference *actual paths + schemas + generated outputs*. Any claims not backed by artifacts/citations should be removed or flagged as TBD.

---

## 2) Key insights (what matters most from this review)

1) **Artifact volume improved, but the loop is not closed**
   - 21 files created (19 code), yet **no execution proofs** (no run logs, no test outputs, no generated tables). This keeps confidence borderline and blocks integration.

2) **Outputs are not centralized**
   - Deliverables are present in agent directories (e.g., code-creation folders, runtime/outputs references), but the system still lacks a clearly enforced, canonical `/outputs` deliverable contract.

3) **Strong foundation pieces now exist**
   - We have:
     - a **preregistration template** (DocumentCreationAgent),
     - a **citation/primary-source access MVP** (CodeCreationAgent),
     - a **task taxonomy codebook + schema + example annotations + validator code** (CodeCreationAgent),
     - synthesis/literature work that can populate the kit once the pipeline runs.

4) **QA correctly flagged borderline confidence—and the fix is procedural**
   - The right response isn’t “rewrite better,” it’s: **execute + verify + log**. Treat acceptance as selective prediction: only accept claims that have traceable evidence and reproducible outputs.

5) **Next bottleneck is operational discipline, not ideation**
   - The system has plenty of conceptual content; what’s missing is a build-test-run cadence that reliably emits versioned artifacts.

---

## 3) Strategic directives (next 20 cycles)

1) **Adopt a “No new research unless it lands in `/outputs`” rule**
   - Every cycle must produce at least one of:
     - a generated file in `/outputs`,
     - a run log in `/outputs/runlogs`,
     - a passing validator/test output,
     - an updated manifest with checksums.

2) **Convert current code into a runnable, one-command pipeline**
   - Target: `make all` (or `python -m ...`) that:
     - validates schemas,
     - runs the citation lookup on a small DOI list,
     - produces a sample CSV/JSON summary,
     - writes a run log (timestamp, git hash, environment).

3) **Enforce an ID + schema contract before scaling annotation/meta-analysis**
   - Freeze v0.1 of:
     - `study_id`, `source_id`, `doi`, `claim_id`, `annotation_id`,
     - JSON schema validation in CI,
     - “fail build if mismatch” checks.

4) **Implement minimal CI-style acceptance checks**
   - Even a lightweight local CI script is enough initially:
     - run validators,
     - run a tiny demo job,
     - confirm expected output files exist,
     - record results to `/outputs/qa/`.

5) **Bind the narrative report to the artifacts and remove ungrounded sections**
   - The deep report becomes an *index* of what exists:
     - links to schemas,
     - links to generated outputs,
     - a “what is still missing” section with tracked issues.

---

## 4) Urgent goals to create (to close the deliverables gap)

The deliverables audit explicitly shows: **“Code files exist but no test/execution results.”**  
So the urgent goals must be **code execution + validation + consolidation into `/outputs`**.

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Execute and validate the task taxonomy artifacts: run the validator against the created files (task_taxonomy_codebook_v0.1.json, annotation_schema_v0.1.json, annotation_example_v0.1.jsonl) and write a timestamped run log + pass/fail report into /outputs/qa/. Reference the existing files created under code-creation/agent_1766724059832_btjb5f6/outputs/ and ensure results are copied/replicated into the canonical /outputs structure.",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Audit shows 0 execution/test results despite existing taxonomy schemas and validator code; we need proof the artifacts work and a logged acceptance output to close the loop."
  },
  {
    "description": "Execute and validate the citation/primary-source access MVP: run the existing prototype (from code-creation/agent_1766724059834_ostilln, including api_server.py and related runtime/outputs references) on a small test DOI list, then generate and save (a) a results JSON/CSV and (b) a run log (inputs, timestamp, environment, success rates) into /outputs/citations/ and /outputs/runlogs/.",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "A citation MVP was created but there is no recorded execution, no success metrics, and no generated outputs; validation is required before integrating into the starter kit."
  },
  {
    "description": "Create/standardize the canonical /outputs scaffold and consolidate deliverables: mirror/copy the already-created artifacts (prereg template, taxonomy codebook/schema/example, citation MVP outputs) into a single repo-level /outputs directory with a manifest (file list, hashes, provenance) and minimal README describing how to reproduce each artifact.",
    "agentType": "code_creation",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Current deliverables are fragmented across agent directories; without a canonical /outputs structure, nothing is reliably discoverable, reproducible, or reviewable."
  },
  {
    "description": "Implement a minimal 'acceptance checks' runner that produces deterministic QA outputs: a script (or Makefile target) that runs schema validation + demo citation run + writes results to /outputs/qa/ and /outputs/runlogs/. Include a single command to execute locally and a checklist file to record pass/fail.",
    "agentType": "code_creation",
    "priority": 0.9,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "The system repeatedly accumulates code without execution evidence; an acceptance runner operationalizes the 'close the loop' requirement and prevents regression."
  }
]
```

If you want, I can also provide a **one-page “Sprint 1 board”** (tasks, owners/agents, acceptance criteria, and expected files under `/outputs`) that maps directly onto the urgent goals above.
