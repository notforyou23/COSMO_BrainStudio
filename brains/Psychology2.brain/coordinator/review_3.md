## Cognitive Work Analysis

1) Quality Assessment (1–10)
- Depth: 8 — detailed reasoning and examples provided
- Novelty: 7 — exploring fresh territory beyond tracked themes
- Coherence: 6 — focused but somewhat repetitive

2) Dominant Themes
- Exploring territory beyond standard tracked themes
- No single dominant pattern detected

3) Intellectual Progress
Consistent depth maintained across the period, though limited explicit cross-referencing between ideas.

4) Gaps & Blind Spots
No major blind spots detected. Exploration appears well-distributed across multiple conceptual areas.

5) Standout Insights (breakthrough potential)
- 1: analyst — Decision-making relies heavily on fast heuristics that save time but produce systematic biases (e.g., framing effects, anchoring, loss aversion), explaining many predictable errors in judgment. A key ...
- 2: critic — Assumption: Fast heuristics in decision-making are merely error-prone shortcuts.  
Insight: While heuristics trade off comprehensive calculation for speed and can produce systematic biases in novel or...

## Goal Portfolio Evaluation

## 1) Top Priority Goals (immediate focus)
1. **goal_2** — highest scientific payoff; clear, publishable outputs (moderator estimates + task taxonomy).
2. **goal_3** — complementary high payoff; but heavier lift (longitudinal RCTs) so stage after pilots.
3. **goal_1** — strong enabling/infra goal; can run in parallel as a lightweight MVP + protocol.
4. **goal_guided_research_1766723805867** — already complete; only keep if you’ll actively maintain/update.

## 2) Goals to Merge (overlap/redundancy)
- **Merge: goal_2 + goal_3** (shared focus on decision quality, boundary conditions, mechanisms/interventions). Keep as one umbrella program with two workstreams: (A) meta-analytic/task taxonomy (from goal_2) → (B) intervention/longitudinal tests (from goal_3).

## 3) Goals to Archive
- **Archive: goal_guided_research_1766723805867** (completed; keep outputs as a reference library rather than an active goal).
- No mandate-triggered archives (none are >10 pursuits with <30% progress; none monopolize cycles).

## 4) Missing Directions (not represented)
- A **concrete execution pipeline**: milestones, timelines, preregistration templates, analysis plans, sample-size/power strategy.
- **Dissemination/translation**: target journals, open materials/data plan, community adoption plan for goal_1.
- **Feasibility scaffolding**: pilots, IRB/data access, multi-lab coordination plan, funding/grant strategy.

## 5) Pursuit Strategy (how to approach top goals)
- Pick **one flagship “next 8–12 weeks” deliverable**:
  - Either **goal_2**: preregister one focused meta-analysis + build a task taxonomy codebook; or
  - **goal_1**: ship a minimal protocol + small plugin prototype and run a tiny citation-audit study.
- Stage **goal_3** behind pilots: define a single cohort + 2–3-wave design first; don’t start full longitudinal RCT until measures, mediators, and retention strategy are validated.
- Fix the “0 pursued” issue by enforcing **weekly micro-commitments** (1–2 concrete artifacts/week: preregistration draft, codebook, prototype, dataset extraction).

### Prioritized Goals

- **goal_guided_research_1766723805867**: Conduct a comprehensive literature search across peer-reviewed journals, classic texts, and reputable books/websites to collect primary sources and authoritative secondary sources on: cognition, behavior, perception, development, motivation, decision-making, and the history of psychology. Prioritize seminal works, meta-analyses, recent high-impact reviews (last 10 years), and historical primary sources (e.g., works by Wundt, James, Piaget, Skinner, Freud, Lewin).
- **goal_1**: Create and validate standardized workflows and digital tools for primary-source scholarship in psychology: develop a community-endorsed protocol (checklists, metadata standards) and lightweight software/plugins that automatically flag edition/translation provenance, variant page/paragraph numbers, and public-domain repository citations (e.g., PsychClassics, Project Gutenberg). Empirically test how adoption of these tools affects citation accuracy, reproducibility of historical claims, and ease of secondary research (surveys + audit studies across journals and archives).
- **goal_2**: Conduct moderator-focused meta-analytic and experimental programs to explain heterogeneity in cognition–affect–decision effects: preregistered multilevel meta-analyses and coordinated multi-lab experiments should systematically vary task characteristics (normative vs descriptive tasks, tangible vs hypothetical outcomes), time pressure, population (clinical vs nonclinical; developmental stages), affect type/intensity (state vs trait anxiety, discrete emotions), and cognitive load/sleep. Aim to produce calibrated moderator estimates, validated task taxonomies, and boundary conditions for when reflective or intuitive processing predicts better decisions.
- **goal_3**: Implement longitudinal, mechanism-oriented intervention trials that bridge developmental growth models and policy-relevant behavior change: (a) design multi-wave randomized trials combining executive-function and processing-speed measures with fine-grained operationalizations of social support (ZPD: type, timing, fading) to test causal chains from within-child cognitive growth to reasoning and real-world decision outcomes; (b) compare transfer and durability of intervention types (nudge/choice architecture, targeted debiasing training, sleep-restoration protocols) within the same cohorts, measuring both proximal cognitive mediators and distal behavioral endpoints to identify what produces broad, lasting transfer.

## Strategic Decisions

## 1) Top 5 goals to prioritize (by goal ID) + rationale

1. **goal_2**  
   *Rationale:* Highest near-term scientific payoff with clear publishable artifacts (focused meta-analysis + task taxonomy/codebook). Also naturally forces concrete deliverables (dataset, extraction sheet, analysis scripts, preregistration).

2. **goal_1**  
   *Rationale:* Enabling infrastructure that can run in parallel with goal_2. A lightweight MVP (protocol + small prototype) directly addresses the current “no deliverables” failure mode and creates reusable tooling.

3. **goal_3**  
   *Rationale:* High upside but heavier lift; should be staged behind pilots. Start by specifying a minimal longitudinal design only after goal_2 yields task taxonomy + candidate mechanisms and measures.

4. **goal_guided_research_1766723805867** *(move to maintenance/reference mode)*  
   *Rationale:* Marked complete; keep as a curated reference library only if it is actively maintained. Otherwise, archive to reduce cognitive clutter and avoid “busywork without outputs.”

5. **(NEW / urgent) Deliverables Pipeline Goal** *(created below via URGENT GOALS JSON)*  
   *Rationale:* The audit shows **0 files created** despite multiple agent runs. The system needs a hard gate: every cycle must produce a tangible artifact in `/outputs` (code, preregistration, codebook, dataset stub). This goal is the operational backbone for all others.

---

## 2) Key insights (most decision-relevant observations)

1. **Critical operational bottleneck: zero tangible outputs.**  
   The deliverables audit shows an “outputs directory exists but no files created” situation. This is the single biggest risk: it prevents learning, review, replication, and publication momentum.

2. **Goals are conceptually strong but lack an execution pipeline.**  
   The review explicitly notes missing milestones, prereg templates, analysis plans, power strategy, IRB/data access path, and dissemination targets. Without these, work will remain exploratory rather than cumulative.

3. **goal_2 and goal_3 overlap and should be treated as one program with staged workstreams.**  
   Use **goal_2** to define the task taxonomy + effects + boundary conditions; then use that to constrain and de-risk **goal_3** interventions and longitudinal tests.

4. **Agent findings support a tractable core hypothesis space.**  
   The ResearchAgent summary indicates a *modest positive association* between reflective thinking and normative decision performance—promising for a meta-analysis framing and for selecting candidate mediators/measures.

5. **Coherence is acceptable but mildly repetitive; synthesis is underpowered.**  
   The system is exploring multiple conceptual areas, but connections between ideas aren’t being turned into artifacts (codebooks, DAGs, preregistered hypotheses, analysis scripts).

---

## 3) Strategic directives for the next 20 cycles (high-level, action-forcing)

1. **Institute a “No Artifact = Failed Cycle” rule.**  
   Every cycle must produce at least one of: a versioned document, a dataset stub (CSV), a code file, a preregistration draft, a codebook update, or an executed analysis output—saved into `/outputs`.

2. **Pick one flagship deliverable for the next 8–12 weeks: goal_2 as the anchor.**  
   Concretely: “Preregister one focused meta-analysis + ship task taxonomy codebook v0.1 + extraction template + analysis notebook skeleton.” Treat everything else as secondary until these exist.

3. **Stage goal_3 behind validated measurement and feasibility.**  
   In the next 20 cycles, do *not* attempt a full longitudinal RCT. Instead: define (a) the minimal cohort, (b) 2–3 wave schedule, (c) retention plan, (d) primary outcomes + mediators, and (e) a pilot power/precision strategy.

4. **Operationalize synthesis: enforce explicit cross-referencing.**  
   Require that new artifacts explicitly reference prior artifacts (e.g., taxonomy categories map to meta-analysis moderators; intervention components map to mechanisms; measures map to constructs). This increases coherence without adding length.

5. **Add dissemination and reproducibility defaults now (not later).**  
   Decide target venues (2–3 journals/conferences), adopt an open materials plan, define repository structure, and write a one-page “Methods at a glance” that can be reused in preregistration/manuscript drafts.

### Minimal “success criteria” for the next 20 cycles (so strategy cashes out)
- `/outputs` contains: README + changelog + at least **5** versioned artifacts (templates/scripts/docs).  
- A **runnable** meta-analysis skeleton exists (even with dummy data) that generates at least one table/figure.  
- Taxonomy codebook v0.1 exists + schema validator passes on a sample annotation file.  
- A prototype tool exists for primary-source lookup/citation auditing (even if low accuracy at first).  
- One preregistration draft exists and is internally consistent with the taxonomy + extraction template.

If you want, I can convert this into a week-by-week plan (8 weeks) with exact artifact names (filenames), acceptance criteria, and dependencies.

### Key Insights

1. **Critical operational bottleneck: zero tangible outputs.**

### Strategic Directives

1. **Institute a “No Artifact = Failed Cycle” rule.**
2. **Pick one flagship deliverable for the next 8–12 weeks: goal_2 as the anchor.**
3. **Stage goal_3 behind validated measurement and feasibility.**
