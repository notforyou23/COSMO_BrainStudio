## Goal Portfolio Evaluation

## 1) Top 5 Priority Goals (immediate focus)
1. **goal_4** — create the /outputs scaffold so future work produces persistent artifacts.
2. **goal_5** — meta-analysis starter kit (templates + runnable placeholder analysis) to operationalize goal_2.
3. **goal_guided_document_creation_1766723805869** — finish the deep-report deliverable (already started; high priority).
4. **goal_15** — resolve the blocking failure mode (no-output) so document creation can reliably complete.
5. **goal_2** — define the first concrete meta-analytic slice (scope, inclusion criteria, moderator schema) now that goal_5 is underway.

## 2) Goals to Merge (overlap/redundancy)
- **goal_acceptance_qa_1766724281437** + **goal_acceptance_qa_1766724281438** (duplicate QA goals).
- Consider consolidating as an “AI verification” program umbrella: **goal_9**, **goal_10**, **goal_11**, **goal_12**, **goal_14** (high conceptual overlap; split later into phased milestones).

## 3) Goals to Archive (set aside)
**Archive: goal_acceptance_qa_1766724281437, goal_acceptance_qa_1766724281438, goal_6, goal_7, goal_guided_synthesis_1766723805868**

Rationale: these are completed and currently add clutter; keep them as “done” artifacts, not active goals.

### Rotation mandate (monopolized cycles)
- **goal_6** (32 pursuits ≈ 24% of recent cycles) → rotate out (archiving as completed satisfies this).
- **goal_7** (28 pursuits ≈ 21% of recent cycles) → rotate out (archiving as completed satisfies this).

## 4) Missing Directions (important gaps)
- A single **integrated roadmap** tying psychology scholarship-tooling (goals 1–3) to concrete deliverables, timelines, and success metrics.
- **Resourcing/ops plan**: datasets/sources, author roles, expected hours, tooling stack, and “definition of done” per artifact.
- **Publication + dissemination plan** (target venues, preregistration plan, artifact release/licensing, community adoption pathway).
- **Risk/ethics/IRB** planning for audits/surveys and intervention trials.

## 5) Pursuit Strategy (how to approach top goals)
- **Goal_4 first (1 session)**: create folders + README rules + changelog; enforce “no work counts unless an artifact lands in /outputs.”
- **Goal_5 next (1–2 sessions)**: templates + minimal runnable script producing a placeholder forest plot/table from dummy data.
- **Goal_15 (1 session)**: diagnose why “agents produced no output” (missing prompt constraints? missing file paths? no acceptance checks?) and add a fail-fast checklist.
- **goal_guided_document_creation_1766723805869 (2–4 sessions)**: write from the already-completed synthesis; lock an outline; fill sections iteratively; add citations last.
- **goal_2 (parallel, small bites)**: pick one tight domain slice + moderator set; encode directly into the goal_5 extraction template so analysis is immediately executable.

### Prioritized Goals

- **goal_1**: Create and validate standardized workflows and digital tools for primary-source scholarship in psychology: develop a community-endorsed protocol (checklists, metadata standards) and lightweight software/plugins that automatically flag edition/translation provenance, variant page/paragraph numbers, and public-domain repository citations (e.g., PsychClassics, Project Gutenberg). Empirically test how adoption of these tools affects citation accuracy, reproducibility of historical claims, and ease of secondary research (surveys + audit studies across journals and archives).
- **goal_2**: Conduct moderator-focused meta-analytic and experimental programs to explain heterogeneity in cognition–affect–decision effects: preregistered multilevel meta-analyses and coordinated multi-lab experiments should systematically vary task characteristics (normative vs descriptive tasks, tangible vs hypothetical outcomes), time pressure, population (clinical vs nonclinical; developmental stages), affect type/intensity (state vs trait anxiety, discrete emotions), and cognitive load/sleep. Aim to produce calibrated moderator estimates, validated task taxonomies, and boundary conditions for when reflective or intuitive processing predicts better decisions.
- **goal_4**: Create a minimal deliverables scaffold because the deliverables audit shows 0 files created: initialize /outputs with (a) README describing artifact rules, (b) folder structure for meta-analysis, taxonomy, and pilot tooling, and (c) a versioned changelog that must be updated each cycle.
- **goal_5**: Implement a goal_2 meta-analysis starter kit in /outputs (even if using placeholder data): create data-extraction CSV template, study screening log template, and analysis script/notebook skeleton that loads the CSV and produces at least one placeholder forest-plot/table.
- **goal_6**: Create a task taxonomy codebook v0.1 artifact in /outputs plus a simple annotation format (e.g., JSON/CSV schema) and validator script that checks required fields and category constraints.

## Strategic Decisions

## 1) Top 5 goals to prioritize (specific goal IDs + rationale)

1. **goal_4 — create the `/outputs` scaffold**
   - Rationale: This is the system’s primary bottleneck historically (“zero tangible outputs”). Even with recent files created, you still have **0 test/execution results** and **0 analysis outputs**. A hardened `/outputs` scaffold + rules (“no work counts unless an artifact lands in `/outputs`”) is the enforcement mechanism that prevents regression.

2. **goal_15 — resolve the blocking failure mode (no-output) so document creation reliably completes**
   - Rationale: The deliverables audit shows a familiar pattern: plenty of code created, but **no executed proofs** and no “final forms” (plots/tables/validated outputs). goal_15 should implement fail-fast checks: artifacts must be runnable, validated, and produce at least one demonstrable output file per cycle.

3. **goal_5 — meta-analysis starter kit (templates + runnable placeholder analysis)**
   - Rationale: This operationalizes the research program: turning literature synthesis into an executable pipeline. Also directly addresses the audit gap: **0 analysis outputs**. goal_5 should culminate in at least one generated result artifact (e.g., placeholder forest plot + summary table saved to `/outputs`).

4. **goal_guided_document_creation_1766723805869 — finish the deep-report deliverable**
   - Rationale: You already have substantial synthesis inputs from specialist agents (bibliography + synthesis reports). Converting that into a coherent “flagship report” is the fastest path to a publishable artifact and a stable reference point for all subsequent cycles.

5. **goal_2 — define the first concrete meta-analytic slice (scope, inclusion criteria, moderator schema)**
   - Rationale: goal_2 becomes highly actionable now that you have (a) preregistration stub created and (b) a meta-analysis starter kit underway. goal_2 should be tightened into a “first executable slice” that can be extracted and analyzed with minimal ambiguity.

---

## 2) Key insights (most important observations from this review)

1. **Artifact volume improved, but the loop is still not closed**
   - You now have **21 files created (19 code, 2 docs)**, but **0 test/execution results** and **0 analysis outputs**. The bottleneck has shifted from “no files” to “no verified, runnable outputs.”

2. **Validation/QA is signaling risk (56% confidence) and needs a selective-acceptance workflow**
   - Two QA agents report borderline confidence with a recommendation akin to “integrate with flagship but verify.” Research agents explicitly suggest a **selective prediction/abstention** approach: accept only claims with strong evidence; otherwise defer or mark uncertain.

3. **You have strong building blocks for operational research infrastructure**
   - Concrete deliverables exist:  
     - a preregistration + analysis plan stub (DocumentCreationAgent)  
     - a citation/primary-source access MVP server script (CodeCreationAgent)  
     - a task taxonomy codebook + schema + validator components (CodeCreationAgent)  
   - These are infrastructure primitives—now they must be executed, tested, and demonstrated.

4. **The program needs an integrated roadmap tying “theory → pipeline → publishable outputs”**
   - Current work is rich but somewhat fragmented (synthesis, QA theory, tooling). The next stage needs a single throughline: **one flagship question → one extraction schema → one runnable analysis → one written report**.

---

## 3) Strategic directives (high-level directions for the next 20 cycles)

1. **Enforce “execution-first deliverables” (close the implementation loop every cycle)**
   - Definition of done for a cycle: at least one of the following is produced and saved to `/outputs`:
     - execution log proving a tool runs end-to-end
     - a generated analysis artifact (plot/table)
     - a validated dataset/schema pass report  
   - If code is written but not executed, the cycle is considered incomplete.

2. **Converge on one flagship meta-analytic slice (reduce scope, increase finish rate)**
   - For the next 20 cycles, prioritize depth over breadth:
     - lock inclusion/exclusion criteria
     - lock a moderator schema
     - create an extraction template that directly feeds the starter analysis script
   - Avoid expanding to multiple domains until one slice is end-to-end.

3. **Adopt a “selective generation / claim-level verification” publication workflow**
   - For any substantive report claims: break into atomic claims → attach citations or mark as uncertain → only publish verified claims.
   - This will directly address the QA borderline confidence finding and prevent “confident but ungrounded synthesis.”

4. **Integrate tooling into a coherent research ops stack**
   - Connect the artifacts you already have:
     - citation-access MVP → builds the corpus / PDFs
     - taxonomy codebook + schema → structures annotation/extraction
     - meta-analysis starter kit → produces results
     - prereg template → governs decisions and reduces drift
   - The directive is integration, not more new tooling.

5. **Ship the deep report iteratively with staged acceptance**
   - Stage 1: outline + figures/tables placeholders (even if dummy)
   - Stage 2: verified claims + citations
   - Stage 3: final narrative polish + limitations + prereg linkage  
   - Each stage must produce a versioned artifact in `/outputs`.

---

## 4) URGENT goals to create (to close deliverables gaps)

The audit flags a **MEDIUM severity gap: “Code files exist but no test/execution results”** and also **0 analysis outputs**. These urgent goals are designed to produce concrete execution artifacts and validation logs tied to the files actually created.

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Run a smoke-test execution of the citation/primary-source access MVP created by CodeCreationAgent (e.g., api_server.py and related runtime/outputs artifacts). Produce a saved execution log, a sample input DOI list, and a sample output JSON/CSV in /outputs proving the pipeline runs end-to-end.",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Deliverables audit shows citation-access MVP code exists but there are 0 test/execution results. This goal closes the implementation loop with runnable proof and concrete outputs."
  },
  {
    "description": "Execute and validate the task taxonomy tooling: run the validator against the existing /outputs artifacts (task_taxonomy_codebook_v0.1.json, annotation_schema_v0.1.json, annotation_example_v0.1.jsonl). Save a validation report (pass/fail + errors) and an execution transcript to /outputs.",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Multiple taxonomy/schema artifacts were created, but none were executed. Validation proof is required before downstream annotation/extraction can be trusted."
  },
  {
    "description": "Generate the first analysis output artifact from the meta-analysis starter workflow: run a placeholder meta-analysis on dummy data (or minimal hand-entered data) and output at least one table and one plot (e.g., forest plot) saved to /outputs with a reproducible script + run log.",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Audit indicates 0 analysis outputs. This goal forces the system to produce tangible analytical artifacts and establishes the runnable pattern needed for goal_5/goal_2."
  }
]
```

If you want, I can also propose a single-page “20-cycle cadence” (what must ship by cycle 5/10/15/20) aligned to the priorities above—kept tight and measurable.

### Key Insights

1. **Artifact volume improved, but the loop is still not closed**

### Strategic Directives

1. **Enforce “execution-first deliverables” (close the implementation loop every cycle)**
2. **Converge on one flagship meta-analytic slice (reduce scope, increase finish rate)**
3. **Adopt a “selective generation / claim-level verification” publication workflow**
