Keep as one umbrella program with two workstreams: (A) meta-analytic/task taxonomy (from goal_2) → (B) intervention/longitudinal tests (from goal_3).\n\n## 3) Goals to Archive\n- **Archive: goal_guided_research_1766723805867** (completed; keep outputs as a reference library rather than an active goal).\n- No mandate-triggered archives (none are >10 pursuits with <30% progress; none monopolize cycles).\n\n## 4) Missing Directions (not represented)\n- A **concrete execution pipeline**: milestones, timelines, preregistration templates, analysis plans, sample-size/power strategy.\n- **Dissemination/translation**: target journals, open materials/data plan, community adoption plan for goal_1.\n- **Feasibility scaffolding**: pilots, IRB/data access, multi-lab coordination plan, funding/grant strategy.\n\n## 5) Pursuit Strategy (how to approach top goals)\n- Pick **one flagship “next 8–12 weeks” deliverable**:\n  - Either **goal_2**: preregister one focused meta-analysis + build a task taxonomy codebook; or\n  - **goal_1**: ship a minimal protocol + small plugin prototype and run a tiny citation-audit study.\n- Stage **goal_3** behind pilots: define a single cohort + 2–3-wave design first; don’t start full longitudinal RCT until measures, mediators, and retention strategy are validated.\n- Fix the “0 pursued” issue by enforcing **weekly micro-commitments** (1–2 concrete artifacts/week: preregistration draft, codebook, prototype, dataset extraction).",

          "Cycle 1 consistency review (divergence 0.94):\nSummary verdict: The three branches are largely complementary — they describe distinct mechanisms (cognitive heuristics, gut-brain biology, and action-planning) that can each influence real-world choice and procrastination — but they imply different loci for intervention (choice architecture vs. biological modulation vs. individual planning), which creates tensions about what “works” and why. Below are agreements, specific conflicts, and a recommended synthesis and next actions.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All three treat choice outcomes as malleable: behavior is not fixed; interventions can shift decisions without assuming wholesale changes to deep preferences.\n- Interventions can be low-cost and scalable (choice architecture tweaks, implementation intentions, dietary/probiotic changes).\n- Mechanisms operate by changing proximate processes that shape choice (perception/attention/valuation/timing of action), so mediators should be targeted and measured.\n- Experimental evaluation is needed: randomized tests with behavioral outcomes and mediators (e.g., time perception, response latency, compliance).\n- Multi-level approaches are plausible: environmental design and individual strategies can be combined.\n\n2) Conflicting points (mechanism and intervention focus)\n- Locus of change\n  - Branch 1: Changes should target external choice environments (defaults, framing) and assumes biases are cognitive processing shortcuts that persist unless environments are restructured.\n  - Branch 2: Emphasizes internal, biological modulation of subjective time perception via gut-brain signaling — implying changing physiology can shift intertemporal choice.\n  - Branch 3: Focuses on individual-level planning to automate action, bypassing deliberation.\n  Conflict: Should interventions primarily change environments, biology, or individual plans? Each implies different causal lever and scalability/ethics.\n\n- Nature of the target\n  - Branch 1 treats biases as systematic cognitive errors that require architectural fixes, not changes in subjective time perception.\n  - Branch 2 frames preference shifts as changes in perceived temporal distance (a perceptual/neurochemical mediator), not just valuation biases addressed by framing.\n  Conflict: Is impatience best modeled as a valuation bias or as altered time perception? The answer matters for intervention choice.\n\n- Degree of voluntariness and autonomy\n  - Branch 1 and 3 preserve individual agency (nudges + planning) and aim to work within preferences.\n  - Branch 2 involves altering physiology (diet/probiotics), raising different ethical/privacy/consent issues and uncertainty about side effects.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Synthesis principle: Combine levels. Use choice architecture to reduce decision friction and default unfavorable options, use implementation intentions to automate task-initiation, and treat gut-brain modulation as a plausible adjunctive route to alter time perception that requires stronger empirical validation before deployment.\n- Short-term experiments (preregistered RCTs)\n  - Factorial design crossing (A) choice-architecture nudges vs. control, (B) implementation-intention training vs. control, (C) safe gut-brain manipulation vs. placebo (e.g., dietary timing or validated probiotic with prior safety data).\n  - Primary outcomes: objectively measured intertemporal choices, task initiation and completion, procrastination metrics.\n  - Mediators: subjective time-perception scales, serotonin/vagal biomarkers (if feasible), response times, reported decision effort.\n  - Safety/ethics: restrict biological arms to interventions with established safety; obtain ethics approval and informed consent.\n- Measurement priorities\n  - Include both behavioral outcomes and mechanistic mediators so you can parse which pathway drove change (environmental salience vs. time perception vs. action automation).\n  - Use ecological/longitudinal measures (daily diaries, passive phone sensors) to assess real-world durability.\n- Operational recommendation for practitioners (if immediate action needed)\n  - Implement defaults and friction-reducing environmental tweaks for critical decisions.\n  - Teach and deploy implementation intentions as a low-cost behavioral tool to reduce procrastination.\n  - Consider dietary/sleep/circadian hygiene as low-risk supports for self-control (promote evidence-backed practices first); do not recommend routine probiotic/pharmacological interventions until stronger causal human evidence exists.\n- If constrained to one intervention now: start with implementation intentions plus a small set of choice-architecture changes — high benefit, low risk, easy to scale — and collect data to inform whether biological modulation is worth pursuing in your population.\n\nIf you want, I can draft a specific factorial trial protocol (sample size estimates, measures, timeline) or an implementation checklist (default settings + implementation-intention templates) tailored to your population."

    "content": "## 1) Top 5 goals to prioritize (by goal ID) + rationale\n\n1. **goal_2**  \n   *Rationale:* Highest near-term scientific payoff with clear publishable artifacts (focused meta-analysis + task taxonomy/codebook). Also naturally forces concrete deliverables (dataset, extraction sheet, analysis scripts, preregistration).\n\n2. **goal_1**  \n   *Rationale:* Enabling infrastructure that can run in parallel with goal_2. A lightweight MVP (protocol + small prototype) directly addresses the current “no deliverables” failure mode and creates reusable tooling.\n\n3. **goal_3**  \n   *Rationale:* High upside but heavier lift; should be staged behind pilots. Start by specifying a minimal longitudinal design only after goal_2 yields task taxonomy + candidate mechanisms and measures.\n\n4. **goal_guided_research_1766723805867** *(move to maintenance/reference mode)*  \n   *Rationale:* Marked complete; keep as a curated reference library only if it is actively maintained. Otherwise, archive to reduce cognitive clutter and avoid “busywork without outputs.”\n\n5. **(NEW / urgent) Deliverables Pipeline Goal** *(created below via URGENT GOALS JSON)*  \n   *Rationale:* The audit shows **0 files created** despite multiple agent runs. The system needs a hard gate: every cycle must produce a tangible artifact in `/outputs` (code, preregistration, codebook, dataset stub). This goal is the operational backbone for all others.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Key insights (most decision-relevant observations)\n\n1. **Critical operational bottleneck: zero tangible outputs.**  \n   The deliverables audit shows an “outputs directory exists but no files created” situation. This is the single biggest risk: it prevents learning, review, replication, and publication momentum.\n\n2. **Goals are conceptually strong but lack an execution pipeline.**  \n   The review explicitly notes missing milestones, prereg templates, analysis plans, power strategy, IRB/data access path, and dissemination targets. Without these, work will remain exploratory rather than cumulative.\n\n3. **goal_2 and goal_3 overlap and should be treated as one program with staged workstreams.**  \n   Use **goal_2** to define the task taxonomy + effects + boundary conditions; then use that to constrain and de-risk **goal_3** interventions and longitudinal tests.\n\n4. **Agent findings support a tractable core hypothesis space.**  \n   The ResearchAgent summary indicates a *modest positive association* between reflective thinking and normative decision performance—promising for a meta-analysis framing and for selecting candidate mediators/measures.\n\n5. **Coherence is acceptable but mildly repetitive; synthesis is underpowered.**  \n   The system is exploring multiple conceptual areas, but connections between ideas aren’t being turned into artifacts (codebooks, DAGs, preregistered hypotheses, analysis scripts).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Strategic directives for the next 20 cycles (high-level, action-forcing)\n\n1. **Institute a “No Artifact = Failed Cycle” rule.**  \n   Every cycle must produce at least one of: a versioned document, a dataset stub (CSV), a code file, a preregistration draft, a codebook update, or an executed analysis output—saved into `/outputs`.\n\n2. **Pick one flagship deliverable for the next 8–12 weeks: goal_2 as the anchor.**  \n   Concretely: “Preregister one focused meta-analysis + ship task taxonomy codebook v0.1 + extraction template + analysis notebook skeleton.” Treat everything else as secondary until these exist.\n\n3. **Stage goal_3 behind validated measurement and feasibility.**  \n   In the next 20 cycles, do *not* attempt a full longitudinal RCT. Instead: define (a) the minimal cohort, (b) 2–3 wave schedule, (c) retention plan, (d) primary outcomes + mediators, and (e) a pilot power/precision strategy.\n\n4. **Operationalize synthesis: enforce explicit cross-referencing.**  \n   Require that new artifacts explicitly reference prior artifacts (e.g., taxonomy categories map to meta-analysis moderators; intervention components map to mechanisms; measures map to constructs). This increases coherence without adding length.\n\n5. **Add dissemination and reproducibility defaults now (not later).**  \n   Decide target venues (2–3 journals/conferences), adopt an open materials plan, define repository structure, and write a one-page “Methods at a glance” that can be reused in preregistration/manuscript drafts.\n\n---\n\n## 4) URGENT GOALS TO CREATE (to close the deliverables gap)\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Create a minimal deliverables scaffold because the deliverables audit shows 0 files created: initialize /outputs with (a) README describing artifact rules, (b) folder structure for meta-analysis, taxonomy, and pilot tooling, and (c) a versioned changelog that must be updated each cycle.\",\n    \"agentType\": \"code_creation\",\n    \"priority\": 0.95,\n    \"urgency\": \"high\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The audit indicates an outputs directory exists but contains no files; without a scaffold and artifact discipline, subsequent cycles will continue producing no tangible work products.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Implement a goal_2 meta-analysis starter kit in /outputs (even if using placeholder data): create data-extraction CSV template, study screening log template, and analysis script/notebook skeleton that loads the CSV and produces at least one placeholder forest-plot/table.\",\n    \"agentType\": \"code_creation\",\n    \"priority\": 0.95,\n    \"urgency\": \"high\",\n    \"rationale\": \"No analysis outputs exist; a runnable pipeline forces concrete progress and makes later literature extraction incremental rather than reinvented.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Create a task taxonomy codebook v0.1 artifact in /outputs plus a simple annotation format (e.g., JSON/CSV schema) and validator script that checks required fields and category constraints.\",\n    \"agentType\": \"code_creation\",\n    \"priority\": 0.95,\n    \"urgency\": \"high\",\n    \"rationale\": \"goal_2 depends on a taxonomy, but no documents or schemas exist; a code-enforced schema prevents drift and enables multi-annotator consistency checks.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Build a lightweight citation/primary-source access MVP prototype saved to /outputs (e.g., script that takes a DOI list and attempts to locate open full-text via known repositories/APIs, logging success/failure) to support goal_1.\",\n    \"agentType\": \"code_creation\",\n    \"priority\": 0.95,\n    \"urgency\": \"high\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The system identified primary-source repositories as high-utility, but produced no tool or artifact; a minimal prototype converts that insight into reusable infrastructure.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Create a one-page preregistration template + analysis plan stub (saved in /outputs) tailored to the flagship goal_2 meta-analysis, including primary outcome definition, inclusion criteria, moderator plan, and sensitivity analyses.\",\n    \"agentType\": \"document_creation\",\n    \"priority\": 0.9,\n    \"urgency\": \"high\",\n    \"rationale\": \"The review explicitly flags missing prereg templates and analysis plans; producing this document converts strategy into an executable protocol and reduces future rework.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Minimal “success criteria” for the next 20 cycles (so strategy cashes out)\n- `/outputs` contains: README + changelog + at least **5** versioned artifacts (templates/scripts/docs).  \n- A **runnable** meta-analysis skeleton exists (even with dummy data) that generates at least one table/figure.  \n- Taxonomy codebook v0.1 exists + schema validator passes on a sample annotation file.  \n- A prototype tool exists for primary-source lookup/citation auditing (even if low accuracy at first).  \n- One preregistration draft exists and is internally consistent with the taxonomy + extraction template.\n\nIf you want, I can convert this into a week-by-week plan (8 weeks) with exact artifact names (filenames), acceptance criteria, and dependencies.",
