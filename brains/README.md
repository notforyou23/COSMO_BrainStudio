# 🧠 COSMO Brain Library

Welcome to the heart of the platform. This directory contains the **distilled research artifacts** (Knowledge Graphs) that power the COSMO Brain Studio. 

Each `.brain` folder is a self-contained environment representing thousands of hours of synthetic research, synthesis, and evidence-gathering.

## 📦 Included Brains
