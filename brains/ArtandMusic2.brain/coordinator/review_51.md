## Cognitive Work Analysis

1) Quality Assessment (1–10)
- Depth: 8 — detailed reasoning and examples provided
- Novelty: 7 — balanced mix of familiar and new territory
- Coherence: 5 — moderate thematic coherence

2) Dominant Themes
- algorithmic: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)
- recommendation: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)
- emergent: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)
- attention: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)

3) Intellectual Progress

4) Gaps & Blind Spots
No major blind spots detected. Exploration appears well-distributed across multiple conceptual areas.

5) Standout Insights (breakthrough potential)
- 35: critic — Assumption: art and music exist mainly for aesthetic pleasure — while aesthetics matter, their primary functions historically and cognitively are communicative, social, and ritualistic, shaping identi...
- 41: critic — **Insight:** Art and music are unified human capacities for meaning-making that translate cognitive patterns—emotion, memory, and cultural narrative—into sensory forms; their creativity and aesthetics...
- 43: analyst — Creativity: impose a specific constraint (e.g., single chord progression or three-color palette and a 30-minute limit) to force unexpected combinations—this method, used historically in forms like son...
- 42: curiosity — Question:
How might mapping the structural arcs of visual narratives (composition, color progression, spatial rhythm) onto musical form (harmony, tempo, motif development) create new modes of cross-se...
- 46: analyst — Expression: regularly pair a brief musical improvisation (5–10 minutes) with an immediate visual response (sketch or color wash) to force nonverbal translation between sound and image; this trains you...

## Goal Portfolio Evaluation

## 1) Top 5 priority goals (immediate focus)
1. **goal_58** (tracker + artifact discoverability reconciliation; resolves contradictions blocking QA)
2. **goal_46** (actually execute scaffold/tooling; produce logs/results so audits stop showing “0 runs”)
3. **goal_95** (single aggregated QA report generator = makes progress measurable and enforceable)
4. **goal_81** (create the tangible pilot deliverables: draft report + one complete pilot case study)
5. **goal_48** (a concrete 12–case-study backlog so work can scale without ambiguity)

## 2) Goals to merge (redundant clusters)
- **Tracking / discoverability:** goal_8 + goal_58 + goal_66 + goal_94 (+ goal_64 as the tracker artifact)
- **Rights artifacts:** goal_26 + goal_32 + goal_82
- **Case-study rubric:** goal_27 + goal_33 + goal_80 + goal_96
- **QA gate spec:** goal_28 + goal_57 + goal_74 + goal_73 + goal_91
- **Execution + logs:** goal_46 + goal_56 + goal_65 + goal_86 + goal_92 + goal_99
- **Validation harness (“one command” runner):** goal_47 + goal_89 + goal_98
- **Schema validation reports:** goal_67 + goal_78 + goal_90 + goal_100
- **Draft report + pilot case study:** goal_31 + goal_81 + goal_87
- **Case-study schema + “new case study” CLI:** goal_34 + goal_69 + goal_76 + goal_88
- **Link checking:** goal_60 + goal_93

## 3) Goals to archive (set aside)
**Rotate/Archive (monopolized cycles / already complete):** goal_2, goal_26, goal_27, goal_32, goal_96, goal_97, synthesis_47  
**Archive (low-value/premature vs current delivery pipeline):** goal_36, goal_37, goal_38, goal_39, goal_40, goal_41, goal_42, goal_43, goal_44, goal_45  
**Archive (blocked/obsolete as written; replace with backlog + pilot-first execution):** goal_29  

*(No goals meet the mandate “>10 pursuits and <30% progress” based on the provided stats.)*

## 4) Missing directions (important gaps)
- A single, explicit **definition of “done”** for the final deliverable (word count, #case studies, citation style, required sections) tied to one canonical root.
- **Release/versioning discipline**: changelog + version tags for report and case-study schema (so QA can compare runs).
- A minimal **timeboxed execution plan** (1–2 week sprint board) with dependency ordering (scaffold → index/tracker → QA → pilot → scale).

## 5) Pursuit strategy (how to approach top goals)
- **Unify the filesystem reality first:** do **goal_58** so every artifact has one canonical path and is indexed.
- **Make progress testable:** run **goal_46** and immediately commit the logs; then implement/run **goal_95** so every run yields PASS/FAIL + actionable failures.
- **Ship one complete “golden” example:** finish **goal_81** (draft + one pilot case study fully rights/citations/metadata complete) and run QA on it.
- **Scale only after the golden example passes:** create **goal_48** backlog and then add case studies using the same validated pipeline.

### Prioritized Goals

- **goal_2**: Test and extend the DMN–ECN network account in ecologically valid, domain-specific creative practice: multimodal causal studies combining fMRI/EEG, real-world artistic tasks, neurofeedback or noninvasive stimulation, and longitudinal performance assessments. Key questions: how do generation–evaluation dynamics vary by art form, expertise level, and cultural background? Do network-targeted interventions produce transferable gains in originality, craft, or audience-validated creativity, and what are the boundary conditions and individual differences?
- **goal_8**: Reconcile tracking inconsistency as a concrete artifact (audit shows 0 files): create TRACKING_RECONCILIATION.md that defines a single source of truth for pursued goals, progress %, and QA status, and updates the portfolio to resolve the 'ACTUALLY PURSUED: 0 of 8' conflict.
- **goal_9**: Complete and standardize the intake checklist for each query: require the exact claim text (verbatim), the source/context (who made it, date, link or screenshot), and at least one provenance anchor (dataset name/DOI/link or paper title/author). Provide template examples and validation rules so agents cannot start work until these fields are filled.
- **goal_10**: Specify evidence-targeting parameters per workstream: for primary-source verification supply dataset identifiers and any keywords/author names; for systematic review searches supply PICO elements (Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparator, Outcomes) and date range (2019–2025); for fact-checking supply the suspected misinformation channels and geographic/temporal scope. Use these parameters to produce a pre-defined search plan and prioritized sources list (e.g., repositories, Cochrane, major journals, Reuters/AP/PolitiFact).
- **goal_26**: Create /outputs/RIGHTS_AND_LICENSING_CHECKLIST.md and /outputs/RIGHTS_LOG.csv (fields: asset_id, url, rightsholder, license type, usage permissions, attribution text, restrictions, verification date, reviewer).

2. Narratives are not just beliefs; they are embedded in micro-level pedagogical signals (trait vs. strategy feedback), assessment architectures (single-shot vs. iterative portfolios), and gatekeeping rubrics—functioning as implicit policy regimes that allocate opportunity and thus shape who becomes “c...
3. The dominant causal mechanism is a self-reinforcing selection loop: institutions use cheap, high-noise proxies (polish, charisma, early bloom) that correlate with prior access, label the result as “genius,” then preferentially invest in those students—making the narrative ‘true by construction.’...

## Strategic Decisions

## 1) Top 5 goals to prioritize (next up, in order)

1) **goal_46 — Execute scaffold/tooling + produce logs/results**  
   **Rationale:** The deliverables audit shows **49 code files but 0 test/execution results**. This is the main blocker: until we run the tools and emit QA artifacts, progress remains unauditable.

2) **goal_58 — Tracker + artifact discoverability reconciliation (single source of truth)**  
   **Rationale:** Many artifacts exist across multiple generated paths; without canonical indexing and consistent paths, QA agents keep reporting “no artifacts found” even when they exist.

3) **goal_95 — Single aggregated QA report generator (measurable PASS/FAIL)**  
   **Rationale:** We need one authoritative “status page” per run that merges: required-files presence, schema validation, linkcheck, and report/case-study completeness. This turns work into enforceable gates.

4) **goal_81 — Tangible pilot deliverables: draft report + 1 complete pilot case study**  
   **Rationale:** A “golden example” (end-to-end, rights + citations + metadata + analysis) is required before scaling case studies. It also stress-tests the schema and QA gate.

5) **goal_48 — Concrete 12–case-study backlog (scaled pipeline-ready)**  
   **Rationale:** Once the golden example passes QA, we need a clearly tagged and scored backlog so production can proceed without ambiguity and without re-litigating selection criteria.

---

## 2) Key insights (most important observations from this review)

1) **Artifacts exist, but the system has not “closed the loop.”**  
   The audit reports **71 files created** and substantial scaffolding, but **0 execution outputs** (no validation reports, no linkcheck results, no run logs). The next gains come from running—not creating more scripts.

2) **Discoverability/path consistency is still a hidden failure mode.**  
   Multiple agents produced overlapping artifacts (schemas, reports, templates). Even if each is “correct,” QA can still fail if it can’t reliably find the canonical ones.

3) **You already have the ingredients for a robust QA gate—just not an integrated run.**  
   There are validators, linkcheck tooling, trackers, and templates. The missing step is: a deterministic runner → writes outputs → updates tracker → produces one summary.

4) **One “golden” case study is the leverage point.**  
   A single fully compliant case study (rights/citations/tags/exemplars) will expose schema gaps, rubric ambiguity, and QA friction quickly—then everything else becomes repetition.

5) **Theme coherence is improving, but operational coherence is the priority.**  
   The conceptual work (DMN–ECN, institutional adaptation) is strong; execution hygiene (versioning, run outputs, indexing) is what will unlock momentum.

---

## 3) Strategic directives (high-level directions for the next ~20 cycles)

1) **Shift from “produce artifacts” to “run + verify + publish QA outputs.”**  
   Every cycle should end with at least one new file in `runtime/outputs/qa/` or `runtime/outputs/logs/` showing what ran and what passed/failed.

2) **Establish canonical paths and freeze them.**  
   Pick one canonical location each for:
   - report draft  
   - case study schema  
   - case study index  
   - rights log  
   - QA reports  
   Then update tools/README to point only to those, and deprecate duplicates.

3) **Implement a single command workflow.**  
   “One command” should: scaffold → validate schema → linkcheck → compile summary QA → update tracker. This reduces drift and makes audits deterministic.

4) **Promote the pilot case study to “golden test fixture.”**  
   Treat the pilot case study as the regression test: if tooling changes break it, tooling is not ready.

5) **Add lightweight release discipline.**  
   Introduce version tags for:
   - report (`DRAFT_REPORT_vX.md`)  
   - schema (`METADATA_SCHEMA_vX.json`)  
   - QA output (`qa_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.json`)  
   This makes progress comparable across runs.

If you want this plan tightened into a 1-week sprint board (day-by-day with explicit “Definition of Done” per item), tell me your preferred cadence (5-day or 7-day) and whether runs must be reproducible on a clean machine or only in the current environment.

### ⚡ Urgent Goals Created


1. **Run the existing validation toolchain (e.g., runtime/outputs/tools/validate_outputs.py, schema validator, and any scaffold init) and commit the resulting execution artifacts: write a timestamped run log to runtime/outputs/logs/ and write machine-readable QA outputs to runtime/outputs/qa/ (at minimum: qa_summary.json and a per-check report). This directly addresses the audit gap: 49 code files exist but 0 test/execution results.**
   - Agent Type: `code_execution`
   - Priority: 0.95
   - Urgency: high
   - Rationale: The deliverables audit explicitly flags 'Code files exist but no test/execution results'. Until tools are executed and QA artifacts are produced, progress cannot be verified and QA agents will continue to report missing/undiscoverable outputs.


2. **Execute the link-check runner (runtime/outputs/tools/linkcheck_runner.py) against exemplar URLs referenced by the pilot case study/schema, and write results to runtime/outputs/qa/linkcheck_report.json plus a human-readable markdown summary (runtime/outputs/qa/linkcheck_report.md).**
   - Agent Type: `code_execution`
   - Priority: 0.9
   - Urgency: high
   - Rationale: A link-check tool was created, but no execution results exist. Links are a common QA failure mode and must be validated to make the pilot case study 'golden' and stable.


3. **Run the 'add_case_study' / case-study stub generator CLI (created in tooling) to generate one new case-study stub, then validate it against the canonical METADATA_SCHEMA.json / case-study.schema.json and record pass/fail outputs in runtime/outputs/qa/. Update PROJECT_TRACKER.json with the run results and canonical file paths.**
   - Agent Type: `code_execution`
   - Priority: 0.9
   - Urgency: high
   - Rationale: Multiple schema + CLI artifacts exist, but they have not been proven to work together. This closes the integration loop and reduces duplication/path confusion by forcing a single canonical workflow.


4. **Generate a single aggregated QA report artifact (runtime/outputs/qa/QA_REPORT.md and runtime/outputs/qa/qa_report.json) that summarizes: required-files presence, schema validation, linkcheck status, and pilot case study completeness; ensure it references the actual canonical paths and timestamps of the executed runs.**
   - Agent Type: `document_creation`
   - Priority: 0.85
   - Urgency: high
   - Rationale: Even after executing tools, the system needs one human-readable and one machine-readable 'source of truth' to make audits fast and to operationalize goal_95 (aggregated QA reporting).
