## Cognitive Work Analysis

1) Quality Assessment (1–10)
- Depth: 8 — detailed reasoning and examples provided
- Novelty: 7 — balanced mix of familiar and new territory
- Coherence: 5 — moderate thematic coherence

2) Dominant Themes
- attention: 2 mentions (10% of thoughts)
- algorithmic: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)
- emergent: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)

3) Intellectual Progress
Consistent depth maintained across the period, though limited explicit cross-referencing between ideas.

4) Gaps & Blind Spots
No major blind spots detected. Exploration appears well-distributed across multiple conceptual areas.

5) Standout Insights (breakthrough potential)
- 35: critic — Assumption: art and music exist mainly for aesthetic pleasure — while aesthetics matter, their primary functions historically and cognitively are communicative, social, and ritualistic, shaping identi...
- 41: critic — **Insight:** Art and music are unified human capacities for meaning-making that translate cognitive patterns—emotion, memory, and cultural narrative—into sensory forms; their creativity and aesthetics...
- 11: critic — Assumption: artistic value comes mainly from originality. That's misleading—what feels original often arises from novel recombination, context, or framing of familiar elements rather than pure novelty...
- 37: analyst — A key limitation in creativity within art and music is persistent cultural gatekeeping: historical institutions and canons have narrowly defined what counts as "innovative," systematically marginalizi...
- 39: curiosity — Question: How could a performer in a moth-wing suit using silent speech translate insect-like signaling into a multisensory work that fuses choreography, timbre, and visual pattern to make silence its...

## Goal Portfolio Evaluation

## 1) Top 5 priority goals (immediate focus)
1. **goal_68** — pick a single canonical root + required subfolders (stops path fragmentation).
2. **goal_46** — actually run the existing scaffold generator and save execution logs (turn “plans” into real artifacts).
3. **goal_64** — create a single source-of-truth tracker ledger (unblocks coordination + QA).
4. **goal_28** — define one QA gate with explicit pass/fail acceptance checks (prevents more “0 files / non-discovery” regressions).
5. **goal_21** — generate `/outputs/report/DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md` + 1 complete pilot case study end-to-end (first real deliverable).

## 2) Goals to merge (redundant/overlapping clusters)
- **Outputs scaffold / structure**: goal_4, goal_18, goal_30, goal_46, goal_65, goal_77, goal_79  
- **Draft report + pilot case study**: goal_5, goal_21, goal_31, goal_81, goal_guided_document_creation_1766612081856  
- **Case study rubric**: goal_6, goal_27, goal_33, goal_80  
- **Rights artifacts**: goal_26, goal_32, goal_82, (plus rights portion of goal_18)  
- **Tracking + reconciliation + index**: goal_8, goal_19, goal_58, goal_64, goal_66  
- **QA gate + running QA**: goal_28, goal_47, goal_53, goal_57, goal_59, goal_73, goal_74, goal_75  
- **Schema/catalog + tools**: goal_20, goal_34, goal_69, goal_76, goal_78  
- **Link-checking**: goal_60, goal_70

## 3) Goals to archive (set aside)
**Rotation mandate (>20% cycles):** goal_70 (rotate to maintenance; don’t spend primary cycles on it right now).

**Archive (low-value/premature or fragments / duplicates):**  
Archive: **goal_29, goal_36, goal_37, goal_38, goal_39, goal_40, goal_41, goal_42, goal_43, goal_44, goal_45**  

*(No goal meets the “>10 pursuits and <30% progress ⇒ archive” mandate.)*

## 4) Missing directions (important gaps)
- A single “north star” spec: target audience, scope boundaries, success metrics (word count, #case studies, citation rules) tied to QA.
- A concrete case-study acquisition plan (where exemplars will come from, minimum authoritative-source standard, licensing strategy per source type).
- A de-duplication/retirement policy (when merged goals get closed, how IDs map to the canonical goal).

## 5) Pursuit strategy (minimal, execution-first)
- **Sprint order:** goal_68 → goal_46 → goal_64 → goal_28 → goal_21.  
- **Rule:** no new research expansion until the pipeline produces (a) discoverable files in the canonical root, (b) tracker entries pointing to them, and (c) a QA gate pass/fail report.  
- **After the pilot passes QA:** re-activate content-scale goals (e.g., goal_3) by adding 2–3 more case studies using the same schema/rubric/rights workflow.

### Prioritized Goals

- **goal_2**: Test and extend the DMN–ECN network account in ecologically valid, domain-specific creative practice: multimodal causal studies combining fMRI/EEG, real-world artistic tasks, neurofeedback or noninvasive stimulation, and longitudinal performance assessments. Key questions: how do generation–evaluation dynamics vary by art form, expertise level, and cultural background? Do network-targeted interventions produce transferable gains in originality, craft, or audience-validated creativity, and what are the boundary conditions and individual differences?
- **goal_3**: Investigate institutional adaptation to generative AI and its effects on authorship, valuation, and gatekeeping in the arts: comparative case studies and experimental field trials with galleries, ensembles, publishers, festivals, and funding bodies to evaluate new attribution norms, curatorial criteria, labor arrangements, and economic models. Key questions: how do institutions decide legitimacy for AI-assisted work; what new metrics or curation practices emerge to distinguish human contribution; and how do these changes affect cultural diversity, power dynamics, and who gains/loses from lowered barriers to novelty?
- **goal_4**: Create tangible deliverables in the outputs directory (audit shows 0 files): scaffold a /outputs structure and generate initial artifact set including REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md, METADATA_SCHEMA.json, and WORKLOG.md so future cycles can update concrete files rather than only producing insights.
- **goal_5**: Produce a first-pass synthesis draft in /outputs (audit shows 0 documents): create DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md that instantiates the planned era timeline + taxonomy (creativity/aesthetics/narrative/expression), includes placeholders for case studies, and explicitly connects the timbre↔palette mnemonic insight to the report thesis.
- **goal_6**: Create a case study selection rubric and tagging rules as a concrete artifact in /outputs (audit shows 0 files): generate CASE_STUDY_RUBRIC.md with inclusion/exclusion criteria, evidence strength levels, cross-domain comparability rules, and a required minimum metadata set.

2. Narratives are not just beliefs; they are embedded in micro-level pedagogical signals (trait vs. strategy feedback), assessment architectures (single-shot vs. iterative portfolios), and gatekeeping rubrics—functioning as implicit policy regimes that allocate opportunity and thus shape who becomes “c...
3. The dominant causal mechanism is a self-reinforcing selection loop: institutions use cheap, high-noise proxies (polish, charisma, early bloom) that correlate with prior access, label the result as “genius,” then preferentially invest in those students—making the narrative ‘true by construction.’...

## Strategic Decisions

## 1) Top 5 goals to prioritize (specific goal IDs + rationale)

1) **goal_68 — choose a single canonical root + required subfolders**
- Rationale: The audit shows artifacts scattered across multiple agent output locations (e.g., `code-creation/...` and `runtime/outputs/...`). Until one canonical root is enforced, QA will keep “missing” files and downstream automation will remain brittle.

2) **goal_46 — run the existing scaffold generator and save execution logs**
- Rationale: We now have substantial scaffolding/code (e.g., `init_outputs.py`, `validate_outputs.py`, `linkcheck_runner.py`) but the deliverables audit still reports **0 test/execution results**. This is the single biggest blocker to end-to-end confidence.

3) **goal_64 — create a single source-of-truth tracker ledger**
- Rationale: Many artifacts exist, but without one ledger mapping *goal → artifact paths → status → QA results*, coordination and QA discovery will continue to fail (as seen in “QA skipped: no artifacts discovered”).

4) **goal_28 — define one QA gate with explicit pass/fail acceptance checks**
- Rationale: We have QA agents, but they’re not consistently finding artifacts or producing a deterministic pass/fail outcome tied to concrete checks. A single QA gate prevents further “plans without verification.”

5) **goal_21 — generate `/outputs/report/DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md` + 1 complete pilot case study end-to-end**
- Rationale: Several draft reports were created, but they appear auto-compiled and not reliably anchored to the canonical root + schema + rights + citations + QA. We need one “golden path” case study that passes validation and becomes the template for scaling.

---

## 2) Key insights (most important observations from this review)

1) **Implementation exists; validation does not.**  
   The audit shows ~37 created files (27 code), including validators and runners, yet **no execution artifacts** (no logs, no QA reports, no run outputs). This is the primary systemic failure mode.

2) **Artifact discoverability is still failing.**  
   At least one QA run reports “skipped: no artifacts discovered,” despite multiple documents being created. This indicates path fragmentation and/or missing registry entries—not lack of work.

3) **The system is ready for an execution-first pivot.**  
   The toolchain ingredients are present: scaffold init, validators, link-check runner, trackers. The next gains come from running them in a tight loop and saving outputs.

4) **Content synthesis is ahead of pipeline reliability.**  
   There are multiple synthesis/report drafts and strong conceptual progress (e.g., narratives of genius vs craft; DMN–ECN paradigms), but without a stable pipeline, scaling content will compound inconsistency.

5) **One pilot “golden case study” is the leverage point.**  
   A single case study that is schema-valid, rights-logged, link-checked, and referenced by the draft report will turn the project from “document pile” into a reproducible production workflow.

---

## 3) Strategic directives (high-level directions for the next 20 cycles)

### Directive A — Enforce a single canonical output root + discovery rules
- Decide and enforce **one** canonical root (recommended based on created tooling): `runtime/outputs/`
- Require every agent artifact to land under it (or be copied in with a deterministic sync step).
- Add “no new artifacts accepted” unless registered in the tracker (goal_64).

### Directive B — Switch to an execution-first operating rhythm (generate → run → log → gate)
For every cycle touching tooling:
1) run the script(s),
2) write logs to `runtime/outputs/logs/`,
3) write machine-readable QA outputs to `runtime/outputs/qa/`,
4) update tracker status.

This directly addresses the “0 execution results” gap.

### Directive C — Establish one QA gate that blocks progress (and make it boring)
Create a single command (or single documented procedure) that produces:
- `validation_report.json` (presence checks, schema checks)
- `linkcheck_report.json` (URL reachability)
- `qa_summary.md` (human-readable)
and returns a pass/fail outcome.

No scaling until the gate passes on the pilot.

### Directive D — Produce one “golden path” pilot case study, then templatize
- Select one pilot exemplar (even if conservative/public-domain-friendly).
- Fully populate: metadata/tags, analysis, citations, rights log entry, and exemplar URL(s).
- Ensure report references it and that validators can find it deterministically.
Then freeze the template: “this is what ‘done’ looks like.”

### Directive E — Only after pipeline passes: expand research scope in controlled batches
Once the gate passes:
- Add 2–3 additional case studies using the same schema/rubric/rights workflow.
- Only then re-activate deeper research expansions (e.g., DMN–ECN experimental paradigms, institutional adaptation threads) as *case-study-backed* sections in the report.

## 4) Urgent goals to create (to close deliverables gaps)

The audit’s critical gap is **missing_validation**: code exists but **no test/execution results**. Create these urgent execution goals to generate tangible logs + QA artifacts under the canonical root.

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Run the existing validation/scaffold tooling (e.g., runtime/outputs/tools/validate_outputs.py and any init_outputs.py workflow) and save execution artifacts: stdout/stderr logs to runtime/outputs/logs/ and a machine-readable validation report to runtime/outputs/qa/ (e.g., validation_report.json). This directly addresses the deliverables audit showing 27 code files but 0 test/execution results.",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "The deliverables audit explicitly flags 'Code files exist but no test/execution results'. Until we execute validate/init and persist logs/reports, QA cannot confirm the pipeline works end-to-end."
  },
  {
    "description": "Execute the link-check pipeline using the existing runtime/outputs/tools/linkcheck_runner.py against the current pilot case study artifacts, and write results to runtime/outputs/qa/linkcheck_report.json plus an execution log in runtime/outputs/logs/.",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.9,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "A link-check runner exists per audit, but there are no execution artifacts. Running it produces concrete QA outputs and verifies exemplar URL handling for the pilot case study."
  },
  {
    "description": "Run schema validation for the existing case study metadata using the produced METADATA_SCHEMA.json and emit a schema validation report to runtime/outputs/qa/schema_validation_report.json, with run logs saved under runtime/outputs/logs/. If schema validation is already integrated into validate_outputs.py, confirm by executing it and extracting an explicit schema section in the report.",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.9,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Schema artifacts exist (METADATA_SCHEMA.json) but QA currently lacks proof that any case study is schema-valid. This converts static schemas into verified guarantees."
  }
]
```

---

### What “done” looks like after these steps (practical acceptance targets for the next 20 cycles)
- `runtime/outputs/qa/validation_report.json` exists and reports required files present.
- `runtime/outputs/qa/schema_validation_report.json` exists and shows the pilot case study passes (or lists specific failures to fix).
- `runtime/outputs/qa/linkcheck_report.json` exists with per-URL status codes.
- `runtime/outputs/logs/` contains timestamped execution logs for each run.
- `PROJECT_TRACKER.json` (goal_64) lists each artifact path + last QA status.
- The pilot case study is referenced from `runtime/outputs/report/DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md` and can be located by tooling without manual searching.

If you want, I can also propose the exact QA gate checklist (file presence + schema + linkcheck + tracker consistency) in a single, minimal pass/fail rubric so “QA skipped” cannot happen again.
