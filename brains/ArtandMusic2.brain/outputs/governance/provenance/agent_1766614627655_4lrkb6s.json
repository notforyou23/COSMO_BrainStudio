    "mission": "Design a coherent, testable research framework and study roadmap for longitudinal mixed-methods investigation into how historical narratives of creativity (genius vs. craft/process) shape contemporary arts and music pedagogy, student beliefs, skill development, creative productivity, resilience, and gatekeeping outcomes. Produce operational definitions, candidate measures (survey items, observational protocols, portfolio metrics, and administrative outcome indicators), sampling and longitudinal design options, and a prioritized set of interventions to test for shifting 'genius' myths toward process-oriented mindsets.",
