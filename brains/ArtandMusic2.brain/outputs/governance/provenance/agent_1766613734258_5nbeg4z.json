      "summary": "1) Areas of agreement\n- All three branches treat art and music as human practices shaped by both innate tendencies and cultural/contextual factors: basic emotional responses recur cross-culturally (Branch 1) while forms and meanings are culturally mediated (Branches 1–3 implications).\n- Pattern, structure, and communicative intent are central across modalities: Branch 2’s cognitive grammar of pattern maps to Branch 3’s emphasis on expressive clarity and to Branch 1’s common affective building blocks.\n- Technical skill is instrumental rather than absolute: Branch 3 concedes technique helps but is subordinate to expression, novelty, and affect—this aligns with Branch 1’s point that cultural shaping and function are often more decisive than raw universality or virtuosity.\n- Cross‑fertilization between domains is expected and historically confirmed: innovations in one medium influence the other (Branch 2) and such transfers can prioritize expression/meaning over mere technical display (Branch 3).\n\n2) Conflicting points\n- Degree of universality vs. cultural specificity (Branch 1 vs. Branch 2 emphasis): Branch 1 stresses culturally mediated “universals,” while Branch 2 proposes a stronger cognitive commonality across modalities that may be read as more universal. Tension: is similarity due to deep shared cognition or to convergent cultural practices?\n- Separation vs. unity of modalities (Branch 2 vs. Branch 1/3): Branch 2 argues for a shared cognitive grammar tying music and visual art closely together; Branch 1 highlights culturally specific forms that can make modalities diverge in meaning and function. Branch 3, while compatible with unity in cognitive aims, still centers discipline-specific techniques, implying practical separations.\n- Role of technical mastery (Branch 3 vs. a strict expressive/novelty view): Branch 3 moderates between prioritizing technique and expression; it conflicts with any extreme that either denies the value of skill or that makes skill the sole criterion of “good” work.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions\n- Synthesis statement (concise): Art and music rest on shared cognitive capacities for pattern, timing, and affect, but their realized forms, meanings, and valued skills are heavily mediated by cultural context and practical goals. Technical mastery is a valuable tool for realizing expressive intent, but not an end in itself—innovation and clarity of communication often outweigh virtuosity.\n- Practical next steps (actions you can take)\n  1. Adopt a cross‑modal practice routine: alternate short daily exercises (10–15 minutes) that translate material across modalities (e.g., convert a rhythmic motif into a visual pattern, or paint a short musical phrase). This operationalizes Branch 2 while building expressive fluency (Branch 3).\n  2. Use targeted skill drills tied to expressive goals: identify 2–3 technical skills that directly serve the emotions or effects you want (e.g., dynamic control for tension/release, color blending for mood) and practice them deliberately 3–4 times/week rather than chasing general perfection.\n  3. Contextual reflection: for any work, sketch its intended cultural/social function and audience briefly before creating. That aligns practice with Branch 1’s point on cultural mediation and helps choose which techniques or innovations to prioritize.\n  4. Evaluate by communicative criteria: when assessing works, use mixed metrics—technical control, novelty, and communicative clarity—so you avoid privileging one at the expense of the others.\n- Quick research/learning prompt: review 3 cross‑disciplinary case studies (e.g., Kandinsky/Schonberg synesthetic explorations, Stravinsky–visual art interactions, contemporary multimedia performance) to see how cognitive commonalities and cultural contexts played out historically; use findings to refine your practice priorities.\n\nConcise conclusion: Integrate the branches by treating shared cognitive patterns as fertile ground for cross‑modal innovation, while letting cultural function guide choices of form and the selective deployment of technical mastery to serve expressive aims."
