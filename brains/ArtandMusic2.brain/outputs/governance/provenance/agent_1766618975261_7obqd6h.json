    "mission": "Design a rigorous, multimodal experimental program to test and extend the DMN–ECN network account in ecologically valid, domain-specific creative practice (visual art and music). Produce a prioritized set of experimental paradigms combining fMRI/EEG, real-world creative tasks, neurofeedback/noninvasive stimulation, and longitudinal performance assessments, with clear operationalizations of generation vs. evaluation, sampling plans across art forms, expertise levels, and cultural backgrounds, and candidate outcome measures (behavioral, neural, audience-validated).",
