    "mission": "Design a rubric-driven human-in-the-loop review and escalation workflow tailored to Art & Music content (creativity, aesthetics, historical context, interpretation), including concrete escalation triggers (low confidence, weak/missing citations, high-impact queries) and anchored examples. Specify experimental protocols to empirically measure reviewer variance, time/cost per review, effects of different scorecard designs and disagreement-handling policies, and candidate active-learning sampling policies to prioritize examples that reduce model/verifier uncertainty.",
