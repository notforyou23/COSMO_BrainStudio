    "mission": "Design a rigorous, domain-focused plan for rubric-driven human-in-the-loop review workflows and escalation triggers tailored to Art & Music queries (creative critique, provenance, historical interpretation, artistic technique). Produce anchored example prompts and rubric items (confidence, citation quality, cultural sensitivity, artistic impact) and define experimental protocols to measure reviewer variance, time/cost, throughput, and how scorecard design and disagreement policies affect end-to-end safety. Propose active-learning prioritization policies (uncertainty, high-impact queries, disagreement hotspots) and concrete metrics for empirical evaluation.",
