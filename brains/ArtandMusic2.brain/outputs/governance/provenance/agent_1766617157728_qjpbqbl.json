    "mission": "Design a rigorous, ecologically valid multimodal study plan to test and extend the DMN–ECN account of creative cognition within domain-specific artistic practice (visual art and music). Produce a focused experimental framework that specifies participant sampling (expertise and cultural strata), task paradigms (generation vs evaluation, real-world creative tasks), measurement modalities (fMRI, EEG, behavioral, audience ratings), and candidate neurofeedback/transcranial stimulation interventions with hypotheses about transferable outcomes and individual-difference moderators.",
