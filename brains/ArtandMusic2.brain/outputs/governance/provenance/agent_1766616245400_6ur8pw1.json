[AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Verification is increasingly implemented as “generate → verify → revise” rather than single-shot answering; common patterns include multi-sample self-consistency, best-of-N with a verifier, and retrieve-then-verify (checking entailment/support from retrieved evidence before finalizing).\n\n2. [AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Selective answering requires calibrated confidence: teams commonly calibrate model scores so the system can abstain or trigger extra checks when uncertainty is near a decision boundary, and apply risk-controlled filtering to keep expected error below a target (including conformal-style “sample-then-filter” approaches for open-ended QA).\n\n3. [AGENT: agent_1766612249730_02kggt6] Finding 2: For primary-source verification (2019–2025), the agent identified the minimum viable inputs needed: claim text plus dataset name/link/DOI (or at least research area), and optionally authors/institutions/keywords.\n\n4.

Insight: predictive-timing mechanisms (originally studied for rhythm in music) also structure how we parse visual narratives—so rhythm-based predictive coding links auditory and visual aesthetics, suggesting a shared neurocomputational scaffold for expectation, surprise, and emotional contour across art forms.\n\n7. How does Western-centric modern creativity research risk imposing individualistic, market-driven aesthetics onto non-Western visual and performing traditions, and what methods can decenter that bias to reveal alternative modes of expression and narrative? Key limitation: many studies prioritize measurable, individual authorship and creativity metrics, overlooking communal, processual, or ritual-based practices that resist such quantification.\n\n8. [AGENT: agent_1766612383475_dwl00ez] {\"title\":\"RIGHTS_AND_LICENSING_CHECKLIST.md plus a RIGHTS_LOG.csv template to track permissions for images/audio/video examples used in case studies.\",\"type\":\"report\",\"format\":\"markdown\",\"filePath\":\"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766612383475_dwl00ez/agent_1766612383475_dwl00ez_report_01.md\",\"createdAt\":\"2025-12-24T21:40:20.941Z\",\"wordCount\":1133,\"mode\":\"memory_based\"}\n\n9. [FORK:fork_1] If we assume art and music require human intention, then AI-generated outputs function as tools or raw material whose artistic value depends on a human agent who frames, selects, or modifies them. This reframes debates about authorship and ethics toward the intentions and choices of the human users rather than the capabilities of the algorithm.\n\n10. [FORK:fork_2] Treat each fugue voice as an independent rhythmic stream with its own metric subdivision and accent profile, and map subject entries to synchronized pulse points so imitation appears as timed phase-shifts rather than identical repeats. This preserves contrapuntal hierarchy while producing evolving polyrhythms where intervallic imitation becomes predictable phase relationships across layers.\n\n11. [CONSOLIDATED] Artistic meaning is not guaranteed—or exhausted—by a creator’s human intention; it is largely an emergent, socially mediated relation between an artifact and its interpreters, where context, reception, and collaborative or nonhuman processes can generate significance and shape whether something is recognized as “art.”\n\n12. [AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Verifier quality matters: research notes that rationale-aware verification better distinguishes “lucky correct” answers from genuinely valid reasoning, motivating specialized verifiers beyond brittle prompt/regex checks.\n\n13. [AGENT: agent_1766612249730_02kggt6] Finding 4: For fact-checking, the agent highlighted that context/source (who said it, when, link/screenshot text) is required to find reputable debunks and track updates/corrections by date.\n\n14. [AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Human review works best when selective and rubric-driven: define review triggers (low confidence, weak citations in RAG, high-risk/policy-sensitive queries) and use scorecards with anchored examples plus pass/fail gates; treat annotator disagreement as a signal for escalation or stronger evidence requirements.\n\n15.

Only 0 findings vs 1 success criteria\n\n16. [AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Practical calibration tooling exists: netcal supports post-hoc calibration (e.g., temperature scaling) and reliability metrics; uncertainty-calibration adds bootstrap CIs for calibration error; MAPIE enables conformal prediction sets/intervals when QA can be cast as candidate classification/reranking, supporting risk-controlled deployment.\n\n17.
