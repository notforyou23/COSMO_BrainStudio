With an empty corpus, the only accurate narrative is that **no documentary history is currently available in the dataset** (either nothing was ingested, or the export/query returned nothing).\n\n## What the (current) “history” is\n1. **Origin:** No documents are present, so there is no identifiable starting artifact, authoring event, or initial publication.\n2. **Revision and evolution:** With **0 version chains**, there’s no evidence of drafting, revision, branching, consolidation, or supersession.\n3. **Cross-document influence:** With **0 relationships**, there’s no trace of citations, dependencies, derivations, or shared source material.\n4. **Key changes over time:** With no versions or diffs, there are no detectable “key changes.”\n\n## Most likely explanations (and what they would imply)\n- **Nothing has been collected yet:** The documentary “story” hasn’t begun in the archive.\n- **Data exists but wasn’t included in the export:** The story exists, but you’ve provided an empty index.\n- **Relationships/versioning weren’t computed:** You may have documents, but without the metadata needed to connect them into a history.\n\n## What to provide so I can write the narrative\nAny one of the following is enough to start, and more is better:\n\n- A list of documents with **IDs/titles** and **timestamps** (created/modified).\n- **Version chains** (e.g., `Doc A v1 → v2 → v3`) with dates and brief change notes or diffs.\n- **Relationships** (e.g., “B references A”, “C derived from B”, “D merges A and C”).\n- A “key findings” list (even bullet points) summarizing major edits or shifts.\n\nIf you paste whatever metadata you have (even a small sample), I’ll turn it into a coherent narrative: where the documents start, how they branch or converge, which ones become canonical, and what the major turning-point edits were.",
