      "summary": "Summary (context): All three branches converge on building a canonical, machine-readable way to record artworks and performances (metadata + logs) so they can be discovered, preserved, analyzed, and reused — while explicitly keeping space for interpretive nuance, creator intent, and the ephemerality of performance. Divergence score 0.87 indicates substantial alignment but some significant tensions about scope and how mechanistic the format should be.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Core goal: Create an interoperable, canonical schema (JSON-friendly) that captures provenance, creator intent, technical parameters, and performance logs to improve preservation, discoverability, reproducibility, and reuse.\n- Layered approach: There should be a minimal/core metadata layer and extensible fields for richer data (tempo, gestures, dynamics, audience reaction, sensory metadata).\n- Non-erasure principle: The format must preserve interpretive nuance and artistic agency rather than reduce works to purely deterministic recipes.\n- Use cases: Scholarly research, archival retrieval, remixing/simulation, auditability, and collaborative multimedia creation are all supported by the same underlying data model.\n- Practical requirements: Versioning, stable identifiers, clear provenance, timestamps, and machine-readable structured fields are essential.\n- Governance/participation: Standards should be community-driven with stakeholders from museums, performers, composers, technologists, and rights-holders.\n\n2) Conflicting points (and implications)\n- Degree of determinism vs. interpretive openness\n  - Branch 2 leans toward treating performances as reproducible data (timelines, parametric gestures) to enable simulation/remix.\n  - Branch 1 and 3 emphasize preserving nuance and intent — worry that over-structured logs could freeze interpretation or privilege exact “replication” over re-interpretation.\n  - Implication: Too rigid a schema risks stifling artistic variation and agency; too loose a schema reduces machine utility.\n- Granularity of performance logging\n  - Branch 2 proposes fine-grained runner-style logs (tempo-continuous, gesture-level, audience reaction).\n  - Branch 1/3 favor capturing high-level performance descriptors and provenance plus optional detailed logs.\n  - Implication: High granularity improves reproducibility and analytics but raises data volume, privacy, consent, and archival cost issues.\n- Audience/reactivity capture and ethics\n  - Branch 2 explicitly includes audience reaction as structured data.\n  - Branch 1/3 are less explicit about collecting behavioral/biometric data and emphasize context and consent.\n  - Implication: Capturing audience data enables new research and interactivity but introduces privacy risks and consent/rights/legal complexity.\n- Who controls interpretation and reuse\n  - Branch 2’s reproducible-data framing can enable downstream algorithmic remixing/audit; creators may fear loss of control.\n  - Branch 1/3 emphasize preserving creator intent and narrative, suggesting metadata fields for permitted reuse and interpretive notes.\n  - Implication: Licensing, moral rights, and attribution must be embedded to balance openness with creator control.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\nA. Adopt a layered, extensible canonical schema\n   - Core (required): identifiers, title, creators, date, medium/type, provenance chain, creator intent summary, licensing/rights, performance context (venue, date), essential descriptive tags, schema version, and minimal performance descriptors (e.g., tempo range, duration, high-level dynamics).\n   - Extended (optional namespaces): time-series runner logs (tempo curves, gesture parametrics), synchronized audio/video references, audience metadata (with consent flags), sensor metadata, machine-readable scores, rehearsal/edition history.\n   - Expressive fields: free-text/structured “interpretive intent” and “affordances for variation” so creators specify which parameters are normative vs. open to reinterpretation.\n\nB. Policy, ethics, and access controls\n   - Include consent, privacy, and data-sensitivity flags; require provenance of any audience/biometric capture and opt-in workflows.\n   - Embed license and moral-rights tags; support express reuse options (e.g., “preserve gestures but do not publicly share raw biometric logs”).\n   - Versioning and audit trail: immutable snapshots + diffs for edits/re-interpretations.\n\nC. Governance and implementation roadmap\n   - Convene a multi-stakeholder working group (museums, ensembles, composers, archivists, data/privacy experts, label/rights orgs, technologists).\n   - Produce a minimal JSON template + one or two extended example profiles (museum painting provenance; live music performance runner).\n   - Run pilots: two museums + two ensembles to test ingestion, searchability, reuse scenarios, and ethical workflows.\n   - Build reference tooling: validators, exporters (from DAWs, score editors, museum CMS), viewers that preserve textual interpretive notes alongside data visualizations.\n   - Define success metrics: findability improvements, archival fidelity, reuse cases enabled, artist satisfaction, privacy incident rate.\n\nD. Technical example (practical step)\n   - Draft and publish a 1–2 page minimal JSON schema (core fields) and one extended runner profile (tempo/dynamics/gesture arrays + consent flags) to solicit community feedback within 3 months.\n\nE. Short-term priorities (first 6 months)\n   - Form working group and publish core schema draft.\n   - Create 2 pilot integrations (one museum accession record -> JSON; one live performance recorded with optional runner logs).\n   - Produce policy template for consent/licensing to accompany schema adoption.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft the minimal JSON core schema + one extended performance-runner profile.\n- Outline a pilot plan (stakeholders, data flows, metrics) tailored to a specific museum or ensemble."
