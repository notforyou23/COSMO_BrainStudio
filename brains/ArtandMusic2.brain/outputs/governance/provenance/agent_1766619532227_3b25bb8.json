Assuming creativity in art and music is purely individual ignores the dense social, cultural and historical scaffolding that defines techniques, genres, and what audiences value—styles and \"originality\" are learned, shared, and institutionally shaped. That assumption also obscures power, access, and collaboration, making claims of solitary genius often misleading.\n\n11. [FORK:fork_2] Treat each fugue voice as an independent rhythmic stream with its own metric subdivision and accent profile, and map subject entries to synchronized pulse points so imitation appears as timed phase-shifts rather than identical repeats. This preserves contrapuntal hierarchy while producing evolving polyrhythms where intervallic imitation becomes predictable phase relationships across layers.\n\n12.

[AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Verification is increasingly implemented as “generate → verify → revise” rather than single-shot answering; common patterns include multi-sample self-consistency, best-of-N with a verifier, and retrieve-then-verify (checking entailment/support from retrieved evidence before finalizing).\n\n2. [AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Selective answering requires calibrated confidence: teams commonly calibrate model scores so the system can abstain or trigger extra checks when uncertainty is near a decision boundary, and apply risk-controlled filtering to keep expected error below a target (including conformal-style “sample-then-filter” approaches for open-ended QA).\n\n3.

[FORK:fork_11] Art and music are often framed as vehicles for communication or aesthetic pleasure, but that assumption overlooks their autonomous roles as embodied practices that produce social cohesion, ritual, and cognitive experimentation. A key limitation is that it treats creators and audiences as passive senders/receivers rather than active participants in dynamic, emergent systems where meaning, identity, and affect are continuously negotiated.\n\n16. [FORK:fork_10] Mapping structural arcs (compositio) of visual narratives—tracking shot composition, panel rhythm, focal shifts and thematic beats—makes visible how pacing, emphasis and viewer gaze produce meaning and allows systematic comparison or optimization of storytelling choices. A key limitation is reductionism: such maps flatten multimodal, cultural and affective nuances of perception, risking misreading or overgeneralizing how diverse audiences actually experience the work.\n\n17.
