    "mission": "Design an end-to-end experimental plan for rubric-driven human-in-the-loop (HITL) escalation in the Art & Music domain: specify review workflows, escalation triggers (low confidence, weak/missing citations, high-impact queries), anchored example cases, scorecard layouts, disagreement-handling policies, and active-learning prioritization strategies. Produce a clear experimental protocol to measure reviewer variance, per-item review time/cost, and the effect of scorecard design and disagreement policies on safety (error rate on high-impact items) and throughput, including data collection, metrics, and analysis methods.",
