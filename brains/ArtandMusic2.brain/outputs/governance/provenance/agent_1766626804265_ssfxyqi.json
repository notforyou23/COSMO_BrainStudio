    "mission": "Design a rubric-driven review and escalation workflow tailored to Art & Music content that defines concrete escalation triggers (low model confidence, weak/missing citations, high-impact queries about provenance or critique). Produce anchored examples of labeled items across severity levels, a protocol for disagreement resolution, and a test plan to empirically measure reviewer variance, throughput (time/cost), and the effect of scorecard design and active-sampling policies on end-to-end safety and throughput.",
