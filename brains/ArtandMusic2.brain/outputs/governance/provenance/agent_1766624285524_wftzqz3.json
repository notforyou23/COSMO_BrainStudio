The mission’s requirement is exactly such an explicit acceptance criterion with mandatory documentation artifacts.\n\n---\n\n## Operational rule for pilot runs (what must happen every time)\n\nFor each pilot claim analysis run:\n\n1. Produce the Claim Card artifact (per existing globs and schema path).\n2. Run schema validation against `config/claim_card.schema.yaml`.\n3. Write the **schema validation report** into `/outputs/qa/`.\n4. Produce a QA report file named `QA_REPORT.*` into `/outputs/qa/`.\n5. Confirm both reports indicate **PASS**.\n6. Only then can the claim analysis be labeled “complete”.\n\nBecause `qa.fail_fast: true`, any failure at steps 2–5 should halt the completion path.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCOSMO already has a structured QA gate system (`qa_gates.yaml`, `version: 1`) with fail-fast behavior and an explicit Claim Card schema (`config/claim_card.schema.yaml`). The mission adds a **hard completion gate** for the pilot workflow: **a claim analysis is not complete unless `/outputs/qa/` contains both (1) a passing schema validation report and (2) passing `QA_REPORT.*` artifact(s)**. This requirement is concrete (specific directory + specific artifact naming) and matches COSMO’s stated emphasis on repeatable validation against explicit QA criteria with transparent documentation.",
