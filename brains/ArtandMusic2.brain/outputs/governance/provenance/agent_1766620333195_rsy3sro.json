      "summary": "Overall note: the high divergence score (0.92) means these branches share core ideas but emphasize different aims (historical analysis, compositional technique, practical performance), so a synthetic approach will need to surface and reconcile those emphases.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Art and music operate as parallel, translatable languages: stylistic elements in one medium can be mapped to elements in the other to convey meaning.\n- Technology is a major driver of change in form, distribution, authorship, and audience — it reconfigures who makes meaning and who experiences it.\n- Cross-sensory, deliberate translation (mapping visual motifs → musical parameters) amplifies emotional and narrative effect.\n- Empirical or iterative practice (staging experiments, collecting audience responses) is a useful method to test hypotheses about perception and authenticity.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Ontology of authenticity: \n  - Branch 1 frames shifts as historical data that reveal values, power, and communication (authenticity as historically situated and politically legible).\n  - Branch 2 implies technological mixing/translation can create new expressive strategies — potentially reframing authenticity as procedural or craft-based (skillful mapping), which risks downplaying structural power/ownership concerns.\n  - Branch 3 treats authenticity operationally (an artist’s deliberate mapping and audience response) — which can conflict with Branch 1’s more systemic/political framing.\n- Scope and goal:\n  - Branch 1 is analytic and macro-historical.\n  - Branch 2 is compositional and theoretical (how to translate narrative tools between domains).\n  - Branch 3 is pragmatic and experimental.\n  Tension: whether the priority is critique/contextualization (Branch 1), formal method development (Branch 2), or audience-tested practice (Branch 3).\n- Political/ethical implications:\n  - Branch 1 emphasizes values and power; Branches 2 and 3 focus on craft and experience and do not make power dynamics explicit. This gap risks overlooking questions of access, authorship, and cultural appropriation when implementing mappings or technologies.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Goal: Integrate historical/political framing with compositional method and practical testing so results are both formally innovative and socially informed.\n\nPractical steps:\n1. Literature & case-review (2–4 weeks)\n   - Collect 6–10 historical/technological case studies (e.g., printing, photography, recording, synthesizers, digital sampling) showing how tech shifts altered authorship, distribution, and conceptions of authenticity.\n   - Extract patterns relevant to mapping practices and audience reception.\n\n2. Design a compositional mapping framework (2–3 weeks)\n   - Define a small set of correspondences (e.g., color hue → key/modal center; saturation → timbral brightness; visual texture → rhythmic density).\n   - Include parameters for performer interpretation vs. algorithmic control (who decides mappings).\n\n3. Prototype performance & audience study (one public run + iterative repeat)\n   - Stage a short piece where a visual sequence drives live musical parameters (as in Branch 3).\n   - Collect structured audience feedback: perceived narrative clarity, emotional intensity, perceived authenticity, who/what felt authorial (artist, tech, performer).\n   - Also conduct brief interviews focusing on whether the work felt historically/ socially situated or purely formal.\n\n4. Analyze & iterate (2 cycles)\n   - Compare audience responses against historical insights: do mappings that foreground maker/technology increase or decrease perceived authenticity? Do certain mappings obscure power/agency?\n   - Adjust mappings and presentation to foreground context (e.g., provide program notes tying choices to historical precedents, or include participatory elements to distribute authorship).\n\nEvaluation criteria (keep concise):\n- Emotional fidelity: does the audience consistently read intended narrative/emotion?\n- Perceived authenticity: do audiences attribute meaning to artist, medium, or technology?\n- Ethical transparency: are origins, sampling, and cultural sources disclosed and acknowledged?\n- Accessibility/agency: who participates in creation and interpretation?\n\nConcise recommendation:\n- Run the integrated project: combine Branch 1’s historical framing with Branch 2’s mapping concepts and Branch 3’s live experiment. Use iterative public tests to surface how technology + practice reshapes perceptions of authenticity, and explicitly track power/ownership and audience agency as core outcomes."
