        "evolutionStory": "With the information provided, there isn’t actually any documentary history to reconstruct yet: you’ve listed **0 documents**, **0 version chains**, and **0 relationships**, and the “Key findings” section is empty. That means there’s no evidence base (no timestamps, authors, revisions, successors, merges, or cross-references) from which to narrate evolution.\n\n## Narrative (based strictly on the supplied record)\nThis corpus begins—and ends—as an absence. There are no surviving items to establish an origin point, no subsequent versions to show revision, and no relationships to indicate influence, derivation, citation, or consolidation. If documents once existed, they are not represented in the dataset you’ve shared; if they never existed, then the “story” is that no documentary trail was created or retained. Either way, the record functions like an empty archive: it tells us less about development and more about **missing provenance**.\n\n## What would be needed to tell a real evolution story\nTo write a proper document-history narrative, I’d need at least one of the following:\n- **A list of documents** (IDs/titles), ideally with **created/modified dates** and **authors/owners**\n- **Version chains** (e.g., Doc A v1 → v2 → v3; forks/branches; merges)\n- **Relationships** (e.g., “supersedes,” “derived from,” “references,” “attached to,” “same project as”)\n- Any **key findings** (e.g., “policy split into SOP + checklist,” “template standardized,” “language tightened,” “scope changed”)\n\n## If you paste even a small dataset, I’ll produce the narrative\nSend whatever you have (tables, JSON, or screenshots). Minimal workable example:\n\n- Document list: `doc_id, title, created_at, last_modified_at, owner`\n- Versions: `doc_id, version_id, timestamp, change_summary, parent_version_id`\n- Relationships: `source_doc_id, relation_type, target_doc_id, timestamp(optional)`\n\nOnce you provide that, I can write the “story” you’re asking for: origins, phases of change, branching/merging, stabilization, major rewrites, and how documents shaped one another over time.",
