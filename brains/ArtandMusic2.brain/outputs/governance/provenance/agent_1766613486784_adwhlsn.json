      "summary": "Divergence (0.91) is high — these branches share overlaps but also emphasize different explanatory levels (individual talent vs. social/functional roles vs. agency/origins). Below is a compact map of agreements, key conflicts, and a concrete synthesis + next steps.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Creativity is multi-causal. All branches accept that individual factors (talent, perception, cognition) interact with external factors (education, social networks, technology, cultural norms).\n- Meaning is not strictly fixed. Branches 2 and 3 converge on the idea that meaning is constructed in the interaction between the work and its audiences rather than being a single immutable message imposed by the creator.\n- Non‑human systems can produce experienceable art. Branch 3’s claim that audiences can legitimately assign meaning to generative outputs aligns with Branch 2’s focus on function (tuning expectations) and with Branch 1’s attention to the role of available technologies.\n- Social context matters for innovation. Branch 1 and Branch 2 both emphasize social scaffolding — networks, shared expectations, cultural affordances — as central to artistic impact.\n\n2) Conflicting points (tensions to resolve)\n- Primacy of innate gift vs. contextual explanation: Branch 1’s opening assumption elevates innate individual differences, which can be read as downplaying the systemic/contextual accounts emphasized elsewhere. The branches agree the innate matters, but disagree on how dominant it is.\n- Role of creator intention vs. provenance/authorship importance: Branch 3 argues human intention is not necessary for meaningful art; Branch 2’s functional account is agnostic about source but frames art primarily as a prediction‑updating system. Tension arises in practice and ethics: if meaning is audience‑constructed, how (and should) authorship, credit, and authenticity influence reception, value, and cultural transmission?\n- Evaluation criteria and value judgments: Branch 1 tends toward explanations of how innovation emerges (training, networks) which can imply value judgments about “real” creativity; Branch 3 challenges purity tests about origin (human vs algorithmic). This creates conflict over standards for assessment, curation, and reward.\n- Mechanism focus vs. measurement: Branch 2 proposes a cognitive-mechanistic model (prediction‑updating) but doesn’t specify operational measures; Branch 3 proposes an empirical audience test. There is a gap between conceptual account and operationalization.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\nSynthesis (framework to adopt)\n- Use an interactional model: creativity and artistic meaning = f(individual predispositions, learned skills/practice, social networks/cultural affordances, and technological/media tools). Source (human vs. algorithmic) is one input among many, not a binary determinant of value.\n- Adopt a functional view of meaning: treat artworks as systems that shape predictions and social coordination; reception depends on context, framing, and prior expectations — including beliefs about authorship.\n- Maintain normative safeguards: recognize audiences can legitimately experience meaning from generative works while keeping provenance, authorship, and ethical attribution explicit.\n\nConcrete next research & practice steps\n1. Run the proposed blind audience study, but broaden design:\n   - Conditions: human-made, algorithmic (unlabeled), algorithmic labeled as human, human labeled as algorithmic — to parse effects of provenance framing.\n   - Measures: subjective ratings (meaning, emotional impact, novelty), qualitative interviews, and behavioral proxies for prediction‑updating (surprise, expectation change). If possible add physiological (pupil, EEG) or implicit measures.\n   - Sampling: cross-cultural and varied expertise levels (experts vs. novices) to test socialization effects from Branch 1.\n2. Operationalize Branch 2’s theory:\n   - Include experimental tasks that measure expectation violation and updating (e.g., predict next phrase, measure revision), so you can link compositional features to cognitive effects.\n3. Analyze individual differences:\n   - Collect background (training, exposure, network measures) to estimate how much variance is explained by innate predisposition, training, and social context.\n4. Policy/curation practice:\n   - Adopt transparent provenance metadata in exhibitions and platforms; develop guidelines for crediting hybrid works; use audience data to inform curation without erasing authorship.\n5. Iteration loop for creators (actionable design insight):\n   - Use audience feedback to tune generative systems to reliably scaffold intended expectations/emotions; test effects of contextual framing (program notes, social cues).\n\nBottom line: integrate the branches rather than choose one. Treat creativity and meaning as emergent, context-sensitive phenomena produced by interacting factors (including AI). Empirically test how provenance framing, training/socialization, and compositional features drive prediction‑updating and perceived meaning — then apply those findings to responsible design, attribution, and curation."
