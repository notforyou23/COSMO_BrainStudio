[CONSOLIDATED] Standardize case-study capture into a shared taxonomy and schema-driven, machine-validated workflow—using common templates and lightweight automation—to make inclusion/quality criteria, metadata (citations/URLs, rights/licensing), and claim-level verification explicit, consistent, reproducible, and enforceable across all entries.\n\n3. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, schema-driven workflow for collecting case studies—using shared templates, a single intake index, and automated CLI validation—to ensure every entry is consistently structured, reproducible, and compliant with required citations, rights/licensing notes, and authoritative source URLs.\n\n4. [FORK:fork_5] As societies shift from communal, ritual-based life toward more individualised, commodified and mediated relations, visual and performing arts mirror that by fragmenting narratives, foregrounding personal subjectivity, and turning participation into spectacle or consumption. One key limitation: art reflects and negotiates social change but cannot by itself explain or reverse underlying economic and power structures that drive those shifts.\n\n5.
