[CONSOLIDATED] Reliable document generation depends on using a consistent template/schema to produce structured deliverables (e.g., a draft report plus a pilot case study) and then running a basic QA/validation pass to ensure all required provenance and compliance metadata—especially citations, rights notes, and URLs—are present and complete.\n\n3.

[CONSOLIDATED] Define a shared, machine-validated metadata standard (schemas + templates) and lightweight tooling (CLI/workflows) so case studies and related artifacts are created consistently, include required provenance/rights/authoritative links, and can be reliably cataloged, validated, and reused.\n\n2. [CONSOLIDATED] When adding a new artifact type (e.g., case studies), ensure consistency and discoverability by formalizing its metadata schema and providing a CLI that generates the required files/stubs in the correct output location while automatically updating the project’s central index.\n\n3. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, reproducible `/outputs` workspace—complete with core scaffolds (README, report outline, templates, metadata/schema, artifact indexes) and embedded rights/licensing controls (checklist + log)—so all generated deliverables are consistently organized, traceable, and legally reviewable from intake through final reporting.\n\n4.

[FORK:fork_23] Bold innovation need not reject tradition — use tradition as a scaffold to test risky formal moves in dialogue with history, peers, and audiences so novelty is rooted and legible. Be critical: relying too much on tradition can dilute radical potential, and institutional/commercial pressures often corrode genuine experimentation.\n\n\n*... and 43 more findings in memory*\n",
