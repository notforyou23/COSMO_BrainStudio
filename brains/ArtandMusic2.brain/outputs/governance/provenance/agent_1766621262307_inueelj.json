(Mission statement.)\n- It should be the canonical “QA gate” style step (consistent with the idea of “explicit acceptance/QA criteria with transparent documentation,” and the “canonical QA gate” artifact described in memory).\n- One plan version additionally calls for **emitting a validation summary to `/outputs/logs/validation.txt`**. (Validator plan attempt at `2025-12-24T22-17-09-292Z`.)\n\nBecause the mission allows either a Python script or Makefile task, this implementation uses a Python script at:\n\n- `outputs/tools/validate_outputs.py`\n\nIt is written to:\n1) validate required files exist,  \n2) write a human-readable summary to `outputs/logs/validation.txt`, and  \n3) exit `0` on success and `1` on failure.\n\n> Note: Some planning variants mention “run the scaffold generator first.” The only *explicit, stable* requirement in the mission you gave is the presence check + nonzero exit codes + documenting usage in `WORKLOG.md`. This script focuses strictly on that required gate, and logs the results to the `outputs/logs/validation.txt` path named in the planning notes.\n\n---\n\n## File: `outputs/tools/validate_outputs.py`\n\nSave the following as `outputs/tools/validate_outputs.py`:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"\noutputs/tools/validate_outputs.py\n\nValidates that required project artifacts exist under /outputs.\n\nRequired files (per mission):\n- REPORT_OUTLINE.md\n- CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md\n- METADATA_SCHEMA.json\n- WORKLOG.md\n\nBehavior:\n- Writes a validation summary to: outputs/logs/validation.txt\n-\n\n9.

[CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, schema-driven workflow for collecting case studies—using shared templates, a single intake index, and automated CLI validation—to ensure every entry is consistently structured, reproducible, and compliant with required citations, rights/licensing notes, and authoritative source URLs.\n\n2. [CONSOLIDATED] Reliable document generation depends on using a consistent template/schema to produce structured deliverables (e.g., a draft report plus a pilot case study) and then running a basic QA/validation pass to ensure all required provenance and compliance metadata—especially citations, rights notes, and URLs—are present and complete.\n\n3. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish lightweight, reusable workflow artifacts (a checklist plus a single source-of-truth log) that systematically capture context and verification evidence so externally sourced case-study media can be safely referenced and integrated through an iterative “generate → verify → revise” process.\n\n4. [CONSOLIDATED] Successful exemplar/report pipelines start by scaffolding a standardized, automation-friendly project structure—clear templates and schemas plus a single source-of-truth intake table—so content creation and code generation stay consistent, repeatable, and easy to extend.\n\n5.
