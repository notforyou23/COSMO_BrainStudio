    "mission": "Produce a concrete, methodologically rigorous experimental plan to test the ‘normative’ dimension of Kantian taste across individuals and cultures. The plan should include (a) preregisterable behavioral paradigms and cross-cultural survey items that distinguish private preference from taste-claim norms, (b) neuroimaging (fMRI/EEG) contrasts and task timing that isolate social-cognitive and valuation processes when people make/receive taste-claims, and (c) a statistical analysis strategy (multilevel models, preregistered contrasts, power/sample-size guidance).",
