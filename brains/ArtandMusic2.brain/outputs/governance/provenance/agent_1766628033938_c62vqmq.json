      "summary": "Summary judgment\n- High-level agreement: all three branches converge on the idea that musical structures and temporal thinking can be translated into visual practice (and vice versa) to deepen narrative and emotional impact. They share a focus on deliberate cross-modal design—using repeatable structural devices (motif, rhythm, layering, silence) to shape perception over time.\n- Main tension (explains the high divergence score): Branches 1–2 are largely theoretical/practice-oriented about structural translation; Branch 3 is pragmatic and experimental, narrowing to a short, local multimedia performance with testing constraints. Tension arises between expansive theoretical proposals and the tight, testable scope of Branch 3.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Structural principles matter: rhythm, repetition, contrast, development/arc, and silence/space are effective primitives across audio and visual media.\n- Temporalization of visual elements: color, translucency, brushwork, and sequencing can be treated as time-based parameters that unfold like musical scores.\n- Motif and recurrence enhance narrative memory and emotional engagement: leitmotif-like visual motifs (shape, color, gesture) can cue emotional associations analogously to musical motifs.\n- Multisensory grammar: coordinating visual events with harmonic/motivic events increases coherence and perceived meaning.\n- Feasibility of small-scale prototyping: a focused 5–10 minute work is sufficient to test hypotheses about engagement and perception.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Scope vs. specificity: Branch 1 advocates using complex musical techniques (polyphony, temporal modulation) which can require sophisticated compositional design and audience literacy; Branch 3 demands rapid prototyping and testing within four weeks—may conflict with complexity/time required to realize high-fidelity polyphonic correspondences.\n- Medium translation fidelity: Branch 2’s proposal to treat color as a temporal medium (layered translucency, rhythmic brushwork) assumes viewers perceive temporal unfolding in static canvases or projections; Branch 1’s emphasis on time-based musical devices implies live or time-based visual presentation (video, light, sequencing). If Branch 3 uses projected visuals, it's compatible; if it uses static canvases, the mapping is weaker.\n- Cultural/readership assumptions: Branch 1 posits shared structural principles “across media and cultures.” That generalization risks overlooking culturally specific associations (scales, color symbolism, narrative expectations) which may affect engagement in Branch 3’s local test.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\nA. Adopt a scaled, mixed-complexity prototype approach (resolves scope tension)\n- Core idea: build a 5–10 minute multimedia piece that uses a small set of transferable musical-to-visual mappings—simple leitmotif, one polyphonic texture layered over a drone, clear tempo modulations—paired with visual motifs (color band, repeated shape, translucency layers) that evolve over time.\n- Keep it testable: limit variables so causal inference is possible (e.g., test presence/absence of leitmotif or tempo change).\n\nB. Practical four-week plan (for Branch 3)\nWeek 1 — Design & materials\n- Define a 3–5 element motif set: 1 musical motif (melodic cell), 1 harmonic/dronal bed, 1 visual motif (shape/color), 1 texture approach (translucent layers or rhythmic brush strokes in projection).\n- Choose local folk story and extract a simple narrative arc (setup, conflict, resolution) mapped to time segments.\n- Logistics: recruit 4–6 performers (1-2 live instruments, 1 field recording operator, 1 projection operator), book a small space, prepare equipment.\n\nWeek 2 — Development\n- Compose short musical materials (leitmotif + a counter-melody for polyphony; plan one tempo modulation point).\n- Create visual assets: layered translucent projections or rapid sequence of painted frames; plan synchronization cues.\n- Draft a simple score/synchronization sheet linking cues (timestamps or click track).\n\nWeek 3 — Rehearsal & iteration\n- Run 3 full run-throughs, record them.\n- Observe where emotional peaks align/misalign with intended cues; make 1–2 targeted adjustments (timing, color saturation, motif repetition).\n\nWeek 4 — Test & gather data\n- Present to one small audience cohort (10–20 people).\n- Collect mixed data: short post-performance questionnaire (Likert items on engagement, perceived narrative clarity, temporal perception), 1–2 short interviews, and behavioral observation (applause duration, attention lapses).\n- Optional A/B variant: if time, run two slightly different versions (e.g., with vs. without visual leitmotif) to compare effects.\n\nMetrics to collect (keeps inference tight)\n- Self-report: emotional engagement (1–7), clarity of narrative arc, perceived synchronicity between sound and image, perceived time flow (did the piece feel too long/short/just right).\n- Qualitative notes: moments cited by audience as memorable and why.\n- Observational: start/stop attention, visual focus.\n\nC. Artistic-techniques guidance (bridging Branch 1 & 2)\n- Leitmotif mapping: tie a short melodic cell to a distinct color/shape; vary instrumentation or hue when motif is transformed to signal narrative development.\n- Polyphony as layering: represent musical polyphony with layered translucency—multiple semi-transparent visual layers moving at independent tempi to create visual counterpoint.\n- Temporal modulation: slow down/speed up both music and visual movement in parallel; for static projection, use opacity/fade rate and sequencing to simulate tempo change.\n- Rhythmical brushwork: use looped brush-stroke animations or sequenced projection frames to create visual rhythm synchronized to percussion or pulse.\n- Silence/negative space: use pauses in sound to emphasize visual detail; conversely, introduce visual stillness against sustained sound.\n\nD. Cultural sensitivity & validation\n- Before final performance, consult 1–2 local cultural informants about folk story framing and color/narrative assumptions.\n- Phrase questions in audience survey to capture culturally specific associations.\n\nShort recommended next step (one-line)\n- Commit to the four-week prototype plan with constrained variables (1 leitmotif, 1 visual motif, 1 tempo modulation) and run the small-audience test to gather empirical data that will inform scaling to more complex polyphonic/temporal experiments.\n\nIf you want, I can draft the exact synchronization sheet, a short questionnaire, or a 4-week timeline with specific deadlines and roles assigned."
