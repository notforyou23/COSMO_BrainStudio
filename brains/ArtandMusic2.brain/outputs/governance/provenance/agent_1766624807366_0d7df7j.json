      "summary": "Summary judgment: All three branches converge on turning the moth‑wing suit into a multimodal communicative system that uses gesture and light to carry meaning. They differ chiefly on how formalized and prescriptive that system should be, and on whether the emphasis is aesthetic/communicative (emergent negotiation) or codified/readable (lexicon/phonology).\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Multimodality: Gesture + fabric + lighting (and timing) become the primary carriers of propositional and emotional content.\n- Gesture-as-sign: Wing-folds, micro‑flutters and controlled movement can be intentionally mapped to meaning.\n- Audience negotiation: Interpretation is active — meaningful reception requires communal attention and cues (visual, temporal, contextual).\n- Performative mediation: The performer can translate non‑verbal or procedural material (e.g., “clerk” routines) into embodied narrative.\n- Value of rehearsal & refinement: All branches imply iteration—rehearsal, testing, and refinement are needed to make mappings work in performance.\n\n2) Conflicting points\n- Formalization vs. emergence:\n  - Branch 3 demands a simple, consistent, readable lexicon (8–12 gesture–meaning pairs) with rehearsed disambiguation mechanisms.\n  - Branches 1 and 2 emphasize emergent, negotiated meaning and aesthetic ambiguity (tactile‑visual lexicon; visible phonology/score), resisting strict codification.\n- Conceptual framing:\n  - Branch 1 frames the system as embodied syntax and communal negotiation (phenomenological/experiential emphasis).\n  - Branch 2 frames gestures as a visual phonology/visible music score, focusing on tempo, timbre and motif development.\n- Role of technology and measurement:\n  - Branch 3 explicitly calls for lipreaders/subvocal sensors to map silent speech to gesture.\n  - Branches 1 and 2 do not require technology and lean toward sensory/aesthetic techniques.\n- Intended audience outcome:\n  - Branch 3 aims for readability/translation (the clerk’s lines become decipherable).\n  - Branches 1–2 allow more interpretive openness—meaning can be communal, layered, or suggestive rather than direct.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next action\nGoal: Combine the aesthetic richness and motif development of Branches 1–2 with the pragmatic clarity of Branch 3 via an iterative, data‑informed creative process.\n\nImmediate next steps (practical, 6–8 week plan)\n1. Creative workshop series (Weeks 1–2)\n   - Run exploratory improvisation sessions emphasizing texture, timing, and motif (Branch 1 & 2 priorities).\n   - Surface candidate gestures/motifs (aim for a larger pool, e.g., 20–30 distinct micro‑movements).\n2. Motif curation & prototyping (Weeks 3–4)\n   - Identify 10–12 high‑salience gestures that reliably convey distinct affective/propositional cues in rehearsals.\n   - Prototype lighting cues and timing patterns that co‑occur with each gesture to improve discriminability.\n3. Readability testing (Weeks 5–6)\n   - Run blind audience tests with: naïve viewers, trained lipreaders, and performers. Test both unaided and with lighting cues.\n   - Optionally pilot a subvocal sensor in a limited trial to compare sensor‑aided mapping vs. purely performative mapping.\n   - Collect confusion matrices and qualitative feedback about interpretive variance.\n4. Iterate and codify (Weeks 7–8)\n   - From test data, finalize a practical lexicon of ~8–12 gesture+lighting mappings that balance expressivity and readability.\n   - Document choreography notes, timing windows, and contingencies for ambiguous readings.\n5. Continue development\n   - Use the remaining motifs and emergent material as atmospheric/interpretive layers in performance (retain space for communal negotiation and musical‑score-like motif development).\n\nMetrics to use\n- Recognition rate per gesture (target > 70% for core lexicon in basic tests).\n- Confusion pairs (which gestures often get mixed; redesign lighting/timing to disambiguate).\n- Audience qualitative ratings: perceived expressivity, narrative clarity, emotional resonance.\n\nRoles to recruit\n- Movement director/choreographer experienced with micro‑gesture.\n- Lighting designer comfortable with temporal cues.\n- Lipreader consultant and (if chosen) a technical specialist for subvocal sensor prototyping.\n- Small test audience panels.\n\nConcise rationale\n- This synthesis preserves Branches 1–2’s expressive, communal strengths while applying Branch 3’s clarity where the performance requires reliable communication (e.g., key lines or plot beats). Keep some gestures deliberately ambiguous for aesthetic effect; codify only what must be read consistently.\n\nIf you want, I can\n- Draft a sample 8–12 gesture lexicon framework (gesture name, intended meaning, lighting cue, timing note).\n- Propose a short test protocol and questionnaire for the readability sessions. Which would you prefer next?"
