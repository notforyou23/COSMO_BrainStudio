        "content": "Below are the complete, ready-to-save contents for two new workflow artifacts to place in `/outputs/`:\n\n1) `RIGHTS_AND_LICENSING_CHECKLIST.md`  \n2) `RIGHTS_LOG.csv` (template)\n\nThey are grounded only in the provided COSMO knowledge: the project’s deliverables include *case studies* (with “2–3 sentence justifications and preliminary source leads”) integrated into a final plan document (`runtime/outputs/plan_project_scope_and_outline.md`), and the process emphasizes structured inputs, context capture, and “generate → verify → revise” iteration. The checklist and log operationalize those needs specifically for permissions/rights tracking for *images/audio/video examples used in case studies*.\n\n---\n\n## File: `/outputs/RIGHTS_AND_LICENSING_CHECKLIST.md`\n\n```md\n# Rights & Licensing Checklist (Case Study Media)\n\n## Purpose and scope\nThis checklist governs how we select, document, and approve **images, audio, and video examples used in case studies** so that the final integrated project plan document (`runtime/outputs/plan_project_scope_and_outline.md`) can include media references with traceable permissions.\n\nThis workflow is designed to support:\n- **Case study compilation** (Sub-goal sg_4): “exactly 12 candidates” with justifications and **preliminary source leads**.\n- **Integration** (Sub-goal sg_6): cross-links between case studies and other project components.\n- A verification mindset aligned to observed patterns: **“generate → verify → revise”** (agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw).\n\n> Output artifacts created/maintained by this workflow:\n- `/outputs/RIGHTS_LOG.csv` (the single source of truth for permissions)\n- Any supporting evidence files (screenshots, emails, license texts) referenced by row in the log\n\n---\n\n## When to use this checklist\nUse this checklist whenever a case study draft proposes an **image/audio/video example**, including:\n- media to embed directly in case study writeups,\n- thumbnails/stills for videos,\n- audio clips,\n- performance recordings,\n- any externally hosted media we link and describe as an “example.”\n\nThis checklist is required before sg_6 (integration) finalizes the plan document narrative and cross-links.\n\n---\n\n## Roles (mapped to known agent types)\nThese responsibilities use the agent types already defined in the project plan (sg_1–sg_6):\n\n- **Research agent (sg_4)**: proposes media examples and fills *source lead* details; creates initial log entries.\n- **Project manager (sg_1 / sg_5)**: ensures every case study media item has a log row and an approval status; enforces schedule review checkpoints.\n- **Editorial agent (sg_6)**: only integrates media references that have a completed rights record and an approval status.\n- **QA / verifier** (pattern from acceptance QA work): checks completeness and context (who/when/where/what) before approval.\n\n---\n\n## Rights workflow overview (generate → verify → revise)\nThis workflow follows the same iterative verification pattern noted in QA research:\n1) **Generate**: propose media example(s) for a case study.\n2) **Verify**: capture minimum viable rights inputs + context; confirm permission terms are documented.\n3) **Revise**: if rights are unclear, replace the media example, narrow to a safer reference, or secure explicit permission.\n\nNo media item moves to “Approved” without verification inputs recorded in the RIGHTS_LOG.\n\n---\n\n## Checklist: minimum viable inputs per media item\nThe goal is not “perfect legal analysis”; it is *traceable documentation* sufficient for downstream integration and auditing.\n\n### A. Identify the media item (required)\n- [ ] **Case Study ID/Name**: matches the case study list used in sg_4 (12 candidates, ranked 1–12).\n- [ ] **Media type**: image / audio / video.\n- [ ] **What it is**: title/caption/brief description (what the item depicts or contains).\n- [ ] **Source lead**: URL or repository pointer (a “preliminary source lead” is explicitly required for case studies in sg_4).\n\n### B. Capture rights context (required; aligned to QA “context/source required” finding)\nTo avoid dead-ends and to enable later correction tracking, record context as emphasized in fact-checking guidance:\n\n- [ ] **Who**: creator/rights holder/organization as presented at the source.\n- [ ] **When**: publication date or “as accessed” date for the rights statement.\n- [ ] **Where**: the exact page/location where rights/license info is stated.\n- [ ] **What**: the rights claim itself (quoted or summarized) and any restrictions.\n\nThis mirrors the acceptance QA finding that **context/source (“who said it, when, link/screenshot text”) is required** to track updates/corrections by date (agent_1766612249730_02kggt6 Finding 4).\n\n### C. Record the permission basis (required)\nFor each media item, select and document *one* permission basis, and capture evidence:\n\n- [ ] **License stated at source** (record license name + link/text)\n- [ ] **Direct permission obtained** (record requester, recipient, date, and granted scope)\n- [ ] **Owner/collection terms** (record institution/collection and the specific terms shown)\n\nIf you cannot fill this section from available information:\n- [ ] Mark the item as **“Needs rights verification”** and do not integrate it into sg_6 outputs.\n\n### D. Evidence attachment/trace (required)\n- [ ] Store/attach an **evidence snippet** reference (e.g., screenshot text, copied license statement, or an email excerpt).\n- [ ] Link the evidence reference in the log row (file path or stable pointer).\n\nThis implements the same “minimum viable inputs” thinking used elsewhere:\n- Primary-source verification needed “claim text plus dataset name/link/DOI (or at least research area)” (agent_1766612249730_02kggt6 Finding 2).\nFor rights, the parallel is: **rights text + link + access date** (at minimum).\n\n---\n\n## Approval gates (what “Approved” means)\nA media item can be marked **Approved** only if:\n- [ ] All fields in Sections A–D are completed in `RIGHTS_LOG.csv`\n- [ ] The rights context (who/when/where/what) is captured\n- [ ] The permission basis is clear enough to state “Approved” with a recorded scope\n\nIf any are missing, status must remain:\n- “Needs rights verification” **or**\n- “Do not use / replace”\n\nEditorial integration (sg_6) must treat non-approved items as out of scope.\n\n---\n\n## QA checklist for reviewers (fast pass)\nUse this as a quick audit before sg_6 integration:\n\nFor each proposed case study media example:\n- [ ] There is a matching row in `RIGHTS_LOG.csv`\n- [ ] The row includes:\n  - [ ] source lead (URL/location)\n  - [ ] rights statement context (who/when/where/what)\n  - [ ] evidence reference (screenshot/email/license text pointer)\n  - [ ] an explicit status (Approved / Needs rights verification / Do not use)\n- [ ] If status is not Approved, the media is not referenced/embedded in the integrated plan\n\n---\n\n## Integration rule (for `plan_project_scope_and_outline.md`)\nWhen integrating case studies (sg_6):\n- Only reference media items whose RIGHTS_LOG status is **Approved**.\n- For each integrated media item, include a short media citation line that corresponds to the log row (e.g., “Media: [RIGHTS_LOG row id]”).\n\nThis enforces internal consistency similar to sg_6 success indicators (case studies map to eras/themes; schedule references defined outputs), but applied to permissions: *integrated media references must map to an Approved rights record*.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nThis checklist converts the project’s established working practices—structured minimum inputs, context capture for verification, and a “generate → verify → revise” loop—into a concrete rights workflow for case study media. Maintaining `RIGHTS_LOG.csv` as the auditable source of truth ensures sg_4 case study sourcing remains usable during sg_6 integration, while preventing unverified images/audio/video from entering the final plan output.\n```\n\n---\n\n## File: `/outputs/RIGHTS_LOG.csv`\n\n```csv\nrights_log_id,case_study_id,case_study_rank,media_type,media_title_or_caption,media_description,source_lead_url_or_location,creator_or_rights_holder,rights_statement_text,rights_statement_who,rights_statement_when,rights_statement_where,evidence_reference,permission_basis,permission_scope,requester,permission_contact,request_date,permission_response_date,status,reviewer,review_date,notes\nRL-0001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\n```\n\n",
