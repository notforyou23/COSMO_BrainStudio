## Summary

Across the history of creativity in the arts and music, the dominant explanatory frame shifts from inspiration (divine/irrational “fury”) to craft (rules, imitation, technique) and then to Romantic “genius” (autonomous originality and self-expression). In the 20th century, creativity becomes increasingly process-oriented and empirically studied: psychoanalytic accounts (e.g., Freud on fantasy/daydreaming) are followed by stage/process models (e.g., Wallas) and, mid-century onward, by measurement-oriented psychology (e.g., Guilford’s divergent thinking) and later sociocultural models that treat creativity as validated by communities and institutions (e.g., Csikszentmihalyi’s Domain–Field–Person).

Aesthetics theory similarly broadens over time: from ancient mimesis/catharsis and Enlightenment theories of aesthetic judgment (Kant) to historically situated accounts of art’s cultural role (Hegel), and then to contemporary approaches centered on institutions, context, and experience (including performance/event-based aesthetics and participatory practices). Recent work in neuroscience and technology studies adds a network-based account of creative cognition (generation vs. evaluation dynamics) and foregrounds AI as a practical and philosophical disruptor—shifting debates toward authorship, evaluation, and gatekeeping when novelty becomes easier to produce than to curate or legitimate within an artistic domain.

## Key Findings

1. Historical shift: Western art/music creativity narratives move from “inspiration” and rule-based craft toward Romantic-era “genius,” a conceptual legacy that continues to influence how artistic talent and originality are discussed and taught.

2. Process models helped normalize creativity as a workflow rather than a single flash: Wallas’s four-stage model (preparation, incubation, illumination, verification) remains an influential template for structuring creative practice and training.

3. Modern creativity research pivots toward measurable cognition and later sociocultural validation: Guilford’s 1950 call accelerated empirical study (e.g., divergent thinking), while systems views (e.g., Csikszentmihalyi) emphasize that creativity depends on domain conventions and field-based gatekeeping (critics, teachers, institutions).

4. Neuroscience converges on a network interaction account: creative ideation and refinement are associated with coordinated dynamics between default mode (generation/association) and executive control (evaluation/selection) networks, with recent work reporting causal gains in originality after neurofeedback training of DMN–ECN coupling.

5. Contemporary aesthetics and cultural discourse increasingly treat AI as a core variable: the key question shifts from whether outputs are “creative” to how authorship, standards of appropriateness/usefulness, and institutional evaluation adapt when generative tools change production and distribution workflows.
