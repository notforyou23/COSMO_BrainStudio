Collect at least 25 high-quality sources (peer-reviewed articles, major books, museum/culture institution pages, authoritative interviews) and metadata (author, year, URL, short annotation).",

  "summary": "Across the history of creativity in the arts and music, the dominant explanatory frame shifts from inspiration (divine/irrational “fury”) to craft (rules, imitation, technique) and then to Romantic “genius” (autonomous originality and self-expression). In the 20th century, creativity becomes increasingly process-oriented and empirically studied: psychoanalytic accounts (e.g., Freud on fantasy/daydreaming) are followed by stage/process models (e.g., Wallas) and, mid-century onward, by measurement-oriented psychology (e.g., Guilford’s divergent thinking) and later sociocultural models that treat creativity as validated by communities and institutions (e.g., Csikszentmihalyi’s Domain–Field–Person).\n\nAesthetics theory similarly broadens over time: from ancient mimesis/catharsis and Enlightenment theories of aesthetic judgment (Kant) to historically situated accounts of art’s cultural role (Hegel), and then to contemporary approaches centered on institutions, context, and experience (including performance/event-based aesthetics and participatory practices). Recent work in neuroscience and technology studies adds a network-based account of creative cognition (generation vs. evaluation dynamics) and foregrounds AI as a practical and philosophical disruptor—shifting debates toward authorship, evaluation, and gatekeeping when novelty becomes easier to produce than to curate or legitimate within an artistic domain.",
  "successAssessment": "The success criteria were not met. The provided material summarizes three query result sets and cites roughly a dozen sources, but it does not deliver an annotated bibliography with >=25 high-quality entries, nor does it include the required markdown and JSON outputs (runtime/outputs/annotated_bibliography.md and runtime/outputs/annotated_bibliography.json) with 50–150 word annotations per entry. To meet the criteria, the next step would be to expand source collection to at least 25 authoritative items (major books, peer-reviewed articles, museum/cultural institution pages, and reputable interviews) and compile them into the specified markdown + JSON formats with consistent metadata (author, year, URL, annotation length).",
