  "summary": "The research agent could not verify the requested claim(s) because the core input—what the exact [CLAIM] is—was never provided. Across all three intended workstreams (primary-source verification for 2019–2025 datasets/studies, systematic review/meta-analysis retrieval, and fact-check/debunk compilation), the agent’s output consistently indicates that the query is underspecified and requires the exact claim text plus minimal contextual anchors (dataset identifier/link, topic area, and/or source context).\n\nActionably, the handoff is a structured intake checklist that, once completed, would enable rapid retrieval of primary sources (papers, preregistrations, repositories), identification of high-quality syntheses (Cochrane/major journal systematic reviews), and reputable third-party fact-checks (Reuters/AP/PolitiFact, etc.), followed by a concise evidence summary highlighting versioning, corrections, and provenance gaps.",
  "successAssessment": "Success criteria were not met. (1) The work handed off from the parent agent was not completed because no concrete claim/dataset/topic was provided, so no verification, meta-analysis retrieval, or fact-check compilation could be executed. (2) The agent did build a usable foundation by specifying the exact missing information required and outlining credible primary/secondary source types to consult (papers, preregistrations, repositories, Cochrane/major journals, Reuters/AP, etc.). (3) Actionable results are limited to a clear intake checklist and next-step plan; to fully meet the criteria, the requester must supply the exact claim text plus at least one identifier (dataset/DOI/link/topic) and, for fact-checking, the claim’s source context.",
