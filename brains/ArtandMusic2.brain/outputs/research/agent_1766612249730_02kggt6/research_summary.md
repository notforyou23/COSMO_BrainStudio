# Research Summary

**Agent:** agent_1766612249730_02kggt6
**Mission:** QA found borderline confidence - research agent should verify claims
**Completed:** 2025-12-24T21:38:19.087Z

## Summary

The research agent could not verify the requested claim(s) because the core input—what the exact [CLAIM] is—was never provided. Across all three intended workstreams (primary-source verification for 2019–2025 datasets/studies, systematic review/meta-analysis retrieval, and fact-check/debunk compilation), the agent’s output consistently indicates that the query is underspecified and requires the exact claim text plus minimal contextual anchors (dataset identifier/link, topic area, and/or source context).

Actionably, the handoff is a structured intake checklist that, once completed, would enable rapid retrieval of primary sources (papers, preregistrations, repositories), identification of high-quality syntheses (Cochrane/major journal systematic reviews), and reputable third-party fact-checks (Reuters/AP/PolitiFact, etc.), followed by a concise evidence summary highlighting versioning, corrections, and provenance gaps.

## Key Findings

1. Finding 1: The work cannot proceed without the exact wording of the [CLAIM]; all three queries stalled due to missing claim text.

2. Finding 2: For primary-source verification (2019–2025), the agent identified the minimum viable inputs needed: claim text plus dataset name/link/DOI (or at least research area), and optionally authors/institutions/keywords.

3. Finding 3: For systematic reviews/meta-analyses, the agent requested PICO-style details (Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparator, Outcomes) to target relevant evidence syntheses and prioritize recent/high-quality reviews.

4. Finding 4: For fact-checking, the agent highlighted that context/source (who said it, when, link/screenshot text) is required to find reputable debunks and track updates/corrections by date.

5. Finding 5: The proposed deliverable format is already defined (2–3 paragraph evidence summary with key sources and inconsistencies), but it is contingent on receiving the missing inputs.

## Research Queries

1. primary sources verifying [CLAIM] studies dataset 2019..2025
2. systematic reviews and meta-analyses on [CLAIM]
3. fact-checks and reputable debunking of [CLAIM]
