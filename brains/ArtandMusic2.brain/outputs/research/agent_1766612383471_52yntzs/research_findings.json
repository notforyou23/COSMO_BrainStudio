  "mission": "Conduct a comprehensive web literature search focused on the history and theory of creativity, aesthetics, and expression across visual and performing arts and music. Locate, verify, and collect bibliographic metadata and a short annotation for at least 25 high-quality sources (peer-reviewed articles, major books, authoritative museum/cultural institution pages, and notable expert interviews), and provide working URLs for each.",

  "summary": "Across the history of Western aesthetics, a common arc runs from classical emphases on imitation, order, and ethical/political function toward modern theories that foreground subjective judgment and lived experience, and then onward to social/critical and empirically testable accounts. Kant’s aesthetics is a major pivot point: aesthetic judgment is grounded in a distinctive pleasure (often characterized as “disinterested”) yet still makes a normative claim on others’ assent (taste is not mere private preference). In music aesthetics, 19th‑century debates sharpen around meaning and representation, including Hanslick-style musical formalism that locates “the musically beautiful” in tonal form and internal relations rather than definite emotional representation.\n\nIn parallel, creativity research shifts from romantic “genius” narratives to psychological and systems-oriented models. Contemporary creativity theory, influenced by Guilford’s call for scientific study, increasingly treats creativity as an interaction among skills, motivation, resources, and social evaluation/uptake (e.g., componential and investment-type frameworks). Recent work links these domains back to aesthetics: aesthetic appraisal can function as a selection mechanism that shapes which creative products persist culturally. Newer directions extend into neuroaesthetics (connecting aesthetic experience to perception/reward/attention/emotion) and to AI-assisted creation, where “co-creativity” and trustworthy design are emphasized over framing models as autonomous creative agents. Museum and cultural-institution publishing provides accessible, primary-source perspectives on process and expression, often bridging visual art, performance, and composition through interviews, oral histories, and commissioned cross-medium experiments.",
  "successAssessment": "The success criteria were not met. The research notes include only a small set of sources (roughly ~10–15 items cited across encyclopedia entries, a book link, a few peer-reviewed articles/meta-analyses, and several museum/institution pages/interviews), not the required minimum of 25 distinct sources. Additionally, the deliverable does not provide per-source bibliographic metadata (full author lists, publication years for each item, titles verified against the landing pages), source-type labels for every item, or 1–2 sentence annotations for each source; nor does it systematically flag paywalled items or confirm URL reachability beyond including working links. The mix of perspectives is directionally present (philosophy/history, psychology of creativity, neuroaesthetics, AI co-creativity, and museum interviews/essays), but it does not satisfy the required counts (≥10 peer-reviewed articles, ≥5 books/chapters, ≥5 museum/cultural resources, ≥5 interviews/essays) and lacks balanced coverage across time periods and disciplines at the source-list level. To meet the criteria, the next step is to expand and verify a structured bibliography to 25+ items, add complete metadata + annotations per entry, audit access/paywalls, and ensure representation across visual arts, performing arts, and music (including more core books/chapters and more peer-reviewed empirical aesthetics and creativity studies).",
