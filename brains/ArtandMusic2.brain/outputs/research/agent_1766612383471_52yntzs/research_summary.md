## Summary

Across the history of Western aesthetics, a common arc runs from classical emphases on imitation, order, and ethical/political function toward modern theories that foreground subjective judgment and lived experience, and then onward to social/critical and empirically testable accounts. Kant’s aesthetics is a major pivot point: aesthetic judgment is grounded in a distinctive pleasure (often characterized as “disinterested”) yet still makes a normative claim on others’ assent (taste is not mere private preference). In music aesthetics, 19th‑century debates sharpen around meaning and representation, including Hanslick-style musical formalism that locates “the musically beautiful” in tonal form and internal relations rather than definite emotional representation.

In parallel, creativity research shifts from romantic “genius” narratives to psychological and systems-oriented models. Contemporary creativity theory, influenced by Guilford’s call for scientific study, increasingly treats creativity as an interaction among skills, motivation, resources, and social evaluation/uptake (e.g., componential and investment-type frameworks). Recent work links these domains back to aesthetics: aesthetic appraisal can function as a selection mechanism that shapes which creative products persist culturally. Newer directions extend into neuroaesthetics (connecting aesthetic experience to perception/reward/attention/emotion) and to AI-assisted creation, where “co-creativity” and trustworthy design are emphasized over framing models as autonomous creative agents. Museum and cultural-institution publishing provides accessible, primary-source perspectives on process and expression, often bridging visual art, performance, and composition through interviews, oral histories, and commissioned cross-medium experiments.

## Key Findings

1. Kant’s aesthetics (18th century) frames judgments of beauty as based on a distinctive pleasure (often termed “disinterested”) while still carrying a normative demand for shared assent—positioning taste as more than individual preference and helping define modern aesthetics as a theory of experience plus justification.

2. Hanslick-associated musical formalism (19th century) argues that musical beauty primarily resides in music’s internal tonal forms and structures rather than in representing definite emotions or ideas, sharpening later “absolute vs. program music” debates in music aesthetics.

3. Modern creativity research increasingly models creativity as a system involving domain expertise, creative-thinking skills, motivation (notably intrinsic motivation), and social evaluation—implying that institutions, gatekeepers, training, and audience reception can be as decisive as inspiration for artistic success.

4. Recent integrative scholarship explicitly links aesthetics and creativity: aesthetic appraisal can operate as a selection mechanism determining which creative artifacts persist and spread, bridging production (creativity) and reception (aesthetic evaluation) in a single cultural-psychological loop.

5. Neuro/behavioral synthesis suggests partial dissociation between making and appreciating art: meta-analytic evidence supports stronger prefrontal involvement in creative production versus greater sensory/reward/memory involvement in aesthetic appreciation, and modality comparisons (visual art vs. music) indicate partly distinct networks rather than a single shared neural ‘currency’ for aesthetics.
