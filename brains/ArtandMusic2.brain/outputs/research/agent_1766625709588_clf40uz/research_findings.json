  "summary": "This research identifies a pragmatic pathway into the under-documented area of Black British experimental composition/improvisation from the 1980s–2000s: start with composer-facing catalogues that provide verified works lists and performance/commission metadata, then expand outward to venue/label documentation and longform interviews that capture methods, networks, and reception often missing from conventional bibliographies. The British Music Collection is highlighted as a strong entry point for practitioners who sit between composed “new music,” free improvisation, and cross-disciplinary performance—exemplified by dossiers on Tunde Jegede and Elaine Mitchener that can be mined for named works and collaborators.\n\nOn the primary-source side, the British Library emerges as the central UK repository suggesting immediate, concrete archival work. Its public-facing collection narratives (e.g., Samuel Coleridge-Taylor at 150; Beyond the Bassline exhibition) demonstrate both depth (autograph manuscripts, printed music, recordings, publishers’ archives like Boosey & Hawkes) and a current institutional focus on Black British music histories. However, practical access constraints remain important: post-cyberattack recovery means discovery and requesting can require interim catalogues, staff contact, and advance appointments for Sound & Vision materials.\n\nFinally, the research points to living scholarly and practitioner networks that can rapidly generate further leads, especially the University of Westminster’s Black Music Research Unit (with a public directory of researchers) and curated interviews/conversations (e.g., Barbican’s Mitchener–Alero discussion) that articulate experimental practice as research and name adjacent collaborators, ensembles, and curators. A key gap is that standard academic bibliographies alone may not adequately capture experimental, cross-genre compositional activity; the most fruitful next steps combine archives, institutional hubs, and scene documentation to triangulate works, events, recordings, and critical discourse.",
  "successAssessment": "Criteria 1 (annotated list of ≥6 credible sources) was only partially met in the captured write-up: multiple credible sources were named and linked (British Music Collection entries; British Library press/blog and catalogue guidance; BMRU directory; Barbican interview; Open University project; Café OTO residency materials), but they were not delivered as a single concise annotated list with at least six items explicitly formatted as such, and several citations relied on Wikipedia (useful for triangulation but not ideal as a primary credible source).\n\nCriteria 2 (3–5 paragraph synthesis) was partially met: the findings support a coherent synthesis (catalogues + archives + networks; access constraints; gaps in traditional bibliographies), but the provided synthesis in the research notes was fragmented across queries rather than presented as a unified 3–5 paragraph narrative. The response here supplies a 3-paragraph synthesis, but deeper historical context and explicit controversies/gaps could be strengthened with peer-reviewed scholarship.\n\nCriteria 3 (prioritized 3–5 follow-up investigations with justification) was not met in the provided research results suggesting next steps implicitly but not delivering a prioritized task list. Criteria 4 (at least one actionable lead within a month) was met: the British Library (Rare Books & Music Reading Room; Listening and Viewing Service by appointment) and the University of Westminster BMRU researcher directory are both immediately actionable, contactable leads for primary materials and expert interviews.",
