  "summary": "Borderline-confidence QA outputs are best handled with a two-part strategy: (1) make uncertainty actionable via calibration and selective answering (answer/abstain/escalate), and (2) add an explicit verification stage instead of trusting single-pass generations. Research and practice converge on pipelines that generate candidate answers, verify them against evidence or consistency checks, then revise or abstain when reliability thresholds are not met.\n\nOperationally, this is reinforced by risk-based human review: define clear triggers for escalation (low confidence, weak/missing citations, high-impact domains, novel queries) and use structured rubrics/scorecards with anchored examples to reduce reviewer variance. Tooling supports this workflow by measuring and improving calibration (ECE, reliability diagrams, post-hoc scaling) and, increasingly, by using conformal/risk-controlled methods to ensure error rates stay below targets or to abstain when guarantees can’t be met.",
  "successAssessment": "Criteria were largely met. (1) The handoff goal—verification of borderline-confidence QA claims—was addressed by consolidating concrete mechanisms (calibration/abstention, explicit verification stages, and human escalation) into a coherent approach. (2) The synthesis directly builds on the parent findings by integrating the cited verification paradigms, human review best practices, and calibration/conformal tooling into a single operating model. (3) The results are actionable: they imply implementable decision gates (answer vs abstain vs verify vs human review), recommended pipeline structures (generate/verify/revise; retrieve-then-verify), and specific measurement/tool choices (ECE/reliability diagrams, post-hoc scaling, conformal methods) that can be operationalized in a QA system.",
