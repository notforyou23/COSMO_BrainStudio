Prioritize (a) empirical studies combining fMRI/EEG with real-world creative tasks, neurofeedback/stimulation interventions, and longitudinal performance measures, and (b) domain-specific operationalizations of generation vs. evaluation across art forms, expertise levels, and cultural contexts.",

  "summary": "Across recent fMRI and intracranial EEG work, the field is converging on a network-dynamics account of creativity: performance is linked less to “more DMN” or “more ECN” and more to how flexibly these systems reconfigure and cooperate over time. Large-scale time-resolved resting-state fMRI evidence (multi-site; N=2,433) indicates that DMN–ECN switching predicts divergent-thinking ability, with an inverted‑U relationship suggesting an optimal mid-range regime of switching (too little or too much is suboptimal). Task-fMRI and naturalistic-paradigm work further supports cooperation models in which DMN supports internally generated associations while ECN/frontoparietal systems help constrain, evaluate, and select ideas—implying that ecologically valid experiments should measure temporal dynamics rather than static activation contrasts.\n\nOn the causal-intervention side, emerging neurofeedback and stimulation studies begin to test whether DMN–ECN coordination is a manipulable mechanism rather than a mere correlate. A 2025 covert fNIRS connectivity-neurofeedback study targeting mPFC–dlPFC coupling reported next‑day improvements in originality with an active-control double dissociation, suggesting short-delay transfer and target specificity are achievable. However, meta-analytic evidence for tDCS indicates only small, highly protocol- and task-dependent effects (often more reliable for convergent than divergent thinking), and TMS findings to date largely show acute, region-specific modulation without strong evidence for durable or far-transfer gains.\n\nMethodologically, the generation–evaluation distinction remains central but is increasingly refined: evaluation is being reframed as “valuation” (assigning subjective value prior to selection), with evidence for partially domain-general valuation parameters across multiple task modalities. At the same time, domain validity still hinges on domain-specific expertise and ecologically grounded assessment (e.g., Consensual Assessment Technique with expert judges), and recent work emphasizes that evaluation procedures can actively transform ideas (e.g., through fixation/defixation dynamics), meaning that evaluation is not just measurement but an experimental manipulation that must be carefully operationalized.",
  "successAssessment": "Partially met. (1) Bibliography breadth/size: Not met—only a small set of papers is cited (well under the requested 25–40), and coverage is uneven across modalities (strong on DMN–ECN dynamics and select interventions; limited on multimodal fMRI+EEG in real-world creative practice and on longitudinal craft-level outcomes). (2) Study-by-study extraction for ≥15 papers: Not met—the provided notes include some design/sample details for a handful of high-salience studies (e.g., N=2,433 fMRI; n=13 stereo-EEG; tDCS meta-analysis N=1,538; fNIRS-NF next-day transfer), but do not supply consistent 1–2 sentence structured summaries (design, tasks, expertise/culture, pipelines, outcomes) for 15 studies. (3) Methodological recommendations/gaps: Partially met—clear gaps are identified (need preregistered, adequately powered sham-controlled trials; multi-week follow-up; explicit near vs far transfer; concurrent biomarkers to confirm target engagement; more ecological/naturalistic tasks and domain-valid evaluation via expert judging), but they are not yet organized into a consolidated 4–6 item actionable list tied to a concrete experimental program. (4) Prioritized must-read list with notes: Not met—no 10-paper prioritized reading list with per-paper relevance notes was produced. Overall, the synthesis captures the central mechanistic theme (flexible DMN–ECN reconfiguration and cooperation) and provides a few high-value causal/transfer anchor points, but additional targeted literature collection and structured extraction are required to satisfy the full mission and success criteria.",
