**Mission:** Conduct a focused literature and methods survey to support an ecologically valid, multimodal experimental program testing DMN–ECN dynamics in domain-specific creative practice. Prioritize (a) empirical studies combining fMRI/EEG with real-world creative tasks, neurofeedback/stimulation interventions, and longitudinal performance measures, and (b) domain-specific operationalizations of generation vs. evaluation across art forms, expertise levels, and cultural contexts.

## Summary

Across recent fMRI and intracranial EEG work, the field is converging on a network-dynamics account of creativity: performance is linked less to “more DMN” or “more ECN” and more to how flexibly these systems reconfigure and cooperate over time. Large-scale time-resolved resting-state fMRI evidence (multi-site; N=2,433) indicates that DMN–ECN switching predicts divergent-thinking ability, with an inverted‑U relationship suggesting an optimal mid-range regime of switching (too little or too much is suboptimal). Task-fMRI and naturalistic-paradigm work further supports cooperation models in which DMN supports internally generated associations while ECN/frontoparietal systems help constrain, evaluate, and select ideas—implying that ecologically valid experiments should measure temporal dynamics rather than static activation contrasts.

On the causal-intervention side, emerging neurofeedback and stimulation studies begin to test whether DMN–ECN coordination is a manipulable mechanism rather than a mere correlate. A 2025 covert fNIRS connectivity-neurofeedback study targeting mPFC–dlPFC coupling reported next‑day improvements in originality with an active-control double dissociation, suggesting short-delay transfer and target specificity are achievable. However, meta-analytic evidence for tDCS indicates only small, highly protocol- and task-dependent effects (often more reliable for convergent than divergent thinking), and TMS findings to date largely show acute, region-specific modulation without strong evidence for durable or far-transfer gains.

Methodologically, the generation–evaluation distinction remains central but is increasingly refined: evaluation is being reframed as “valuation” (assigning subjective value prior to selection), with evidence for partially domain-general valuation parameters across multiple task modalities. At the same time, domain validity still hinges on domain-specific expertise and ecologically grounded assessment (e.g., Consensual Assessment Technique with expert judges), and recent work emphasizes that evaluation procedures can actively transform ideas (e.g., through fixation/defixation dynamics), meaning that evaluation is not just measurement but an experimental manipulation that must be carefully operationalized.

## Key Findings

1. A multi-center time-resolved resting-state fMRI study spanning 10 samples (total N=2,433) found that dynamic switching between DMN and ECN predicts divergent-thinking performance, following an inverted‑U pattern where moderate switching is optimal (PubMed: 39809882).

2. Stereo-EEG in 13 neurosurgical patients showed canonical DMN sites are engaged during both mind-wandering and an Alternate Uses Task but with distinct temporal signatures (increased gamma 30–70 Hz and reduced theta 4–8 Hz relative to frontoparietal control regions), and direct cortical stimulation of DMN nodes selectively reduced originality without reducing fluency—supporting a causal role for DMN dynamics in originality (PubMed: 38889248).

3. A 2025 covert fNIRS connectivity-neurofeedback study trained default-mode ↔ executive-control coupling (mPFC–dlPFC) and observed higher originality about 24 hours later; an active-control condition (default–motor) instead improved inhibition speed, indicating target-specific behavioral transfer at short delay (PubMed: 40197641).

4. A 2024 meta-analysis of tDCS and creativity (32 studies; N=1,538) reported small overall benefits of anodal stimulation with stronger evidence for convergent thinking than for divergent-thinking subcomponents (fluency/originality/flexibility), and substantial moderation by stimulation site (often highlighting left DLPFC) (HKBU meta-analysis link provided).

5. Recent operational work distinguishes generation from evaluation and reframes evaluation as valuation; a 2025 study reports valuation parameters that generalize across word association, alternate uses, and drawing tasks, while domain-specific knowledge still shapes what is generated and selected (Nature Communications Psychology: s44271-025-00285-8).
