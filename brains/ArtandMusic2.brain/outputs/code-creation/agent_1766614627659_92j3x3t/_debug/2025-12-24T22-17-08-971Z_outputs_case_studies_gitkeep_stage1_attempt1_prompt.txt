You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define METADATA_SCHEMA.json (or JSON Schema) for case studies and implement a minimal CLI (add_case_study) that writes a new case-study JSON/MD stub into /outputs/case_studies/ and validates it against the schema; include fields for rights/licensing and authoritative URLs (no downloads).
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766614627924 (json cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/case_studies/.gitkeep
- Purpose: Placeholder file to ensure the outputs/case_studies directory exists in the repository for the CLI to write new case studies into.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- schemas/METADATA_SCHEMA.json: JSON Schema defining the required and optional metadata fields for case studies, including rights/licensing and authoritative URLs, used for validation.
- src/utils/schema_validate.py: Utility module that loads the case-study schema and validates JSON documents with clear, actionable error messages.
- src/templates/case_study.stub.json: Canonical JSON stub template populated by the CLI and guaranteed to conform to the schema when required fields are provided.
- src/templates/case_study.stub.md: Markdown stub template for a case study narrative that references the JSON metadata file and provides sections for summary, methods, and sources.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Placeholder file to ensure the outputs/case_studies directory exists in the repository for the CLI to write new case studies into.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/case_studies/.gitkeep')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/case_studies/.gitkeep')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/case_studies/.gitkeep.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
