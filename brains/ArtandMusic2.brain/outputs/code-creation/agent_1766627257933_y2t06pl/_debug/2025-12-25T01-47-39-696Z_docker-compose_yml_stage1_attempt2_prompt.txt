You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement and run a minimal smoke-test job that (a) executes the smallest possible command in the container, (b) captures full stdout/stderr + exit code, and (c) writes a timestamped log bundle to a canonical /out or /outputs path; then wire it into CI as the first gate before any longer runs.
Project: generated_script_1766627258170 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: docker-compose.yml
- Purpose: Defines a minimal service that runs the smoke test inside the container and mounts a host output directory to the canonical /out path for log bundle persistence.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/smoke_test.py: Runs the minimal in-container command, captures stdout/stderr/exit code, and writes a timestamped log bundle under /out or /outputs (with robust fallbacks) for CI gating.
- scripts/write_log_bundle.py: Provides shared utilities for canonical output directory resolution, timestamped bundle creation, and structured log/metadata writing used by the smoke test script.
- Dockerfile: Builds the minimal Docker image needed to execute the smoke test script and its smallest possible container command while keeping runtime dependencies lean.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: Adds a first-gate CI job that builds the Docker image, runs the smoke test via docker compose, and uploads the timestamped log bundle as an artifact before any longer jobs.

Key requirements:
- docker

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines a minimal service that runs the smoke test inside the container and mounts a host output directory to the canonical /out path for log bundle persistence.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('docker-compose.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:docker-compose.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside docker-compose.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
