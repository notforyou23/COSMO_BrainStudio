Mission summary: Implement a 'failsafe no-container mode' in the canonical QA runner so it can still generate /outputs/qa/QA_REPORT.json and logs when the execution container is unavailable. Reuse existing check logic where possible (file presence, schema validation via pure-python, linkcheck optional). Ensure deterministic exit codes and always-write reports.
Project: generated_script_1766627523598 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/qa_failsafe.py
- Purpose: Pure-Python failsafe QA implementation reusing existing checks (file presence, JSON schema validation, optional linkcheck) and producing a deterministic QA_REPORT payload for the main runner.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/qa_run.py: Canonical QA runner that prefers Docker container execution but deterministically falls back to a failsafe no-container mode that always writes /outputs/qa/QA_REPORT.json and logs with stable exit codes.
- scripts/qa_docker.py: Docker integration helpers for the QA runner including container availability detection, robust invocation, log capture, and explicit error classification to trigger failsafe mode.
- scripts/qa_report.py: Shared report/logging utilities that guarantee report directory creation, atomic JSON writing of QA_REPORT.json, and consistent exit-code mapping across container and failsafe modes.
- scripts/qa_checks.py: Reusable check logic (expected output file presence, JSON parseability, schema validation via pure-Python, and linkcheck adapter) consumed by both container and no-container execution paths.

Key requirements:
- docker

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pure-Python failsafe QA implementation reusing existing checks (file presence, JSON schema validation, optional linkcheck) and producing a deterministic QA_REPORT payload for the main runner.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/qa_failsafe.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/qa_failsafe.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/qa_failsafe.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
