You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Run/init an outputs scaffold generator (or manually create /outputs) and populate initial artifacts: REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md, METADATA_SCHEMA.*, and ensure RIGHTS_AND_LICENSING_CHECKLIST.md + RIGHTS_LOG.csv are present and referenced.
Project: /outputs) and populate initial artifacts: REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md, METADATA_SCHEMA.*, and ensure RIGHTS_AND_LICENSING_CHECKLIST.md + RIGHTS_LOG.csv are present and referenced. (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: pyproject.toml
- Purpose: Defines the Python project configuration including an installable console script for running the outputs scaffold generator.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/outputs_scaffold/__init__.py: Package initializer for the outputs scaffold generator utilities.
- src/outputs_scaffold/generator.py: Implements the end-to-end generator that creates /outputs and populates REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md, METADATA_SCHEMA.* plus ensures RIGHTS_AND_LICENSING_CHECKLIST.md and RIGHTS_LOG.csv exist and are cross-referenced.
- src/outputs_scaffold/templates.py: Contains embedded default template contents for all scaffolded artifacts to guarantee deterministic generation without external dependencies.
- src/outputs_scaffold/cli.py: Provides a runnable CLI entry point to initialize or validate the outputs scaffold and report what was created or updated.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines the Python project configuration including an installable console script for running the outputs scaffold generator.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('pyproject.toml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:pyproject.toml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside pyproject.toml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
