You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Run runtime/outputs/code-creation/agent_1766613398846_yr1euha/src/init_outputs.py (or the most current equivalent), confirm the canonical root path, and commit/save the generated /outputs structure plus a timestamped console log under /outputs/qa/.
Project: generated_script_1766620093899 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/_outputs_qa_utils.py
- Purpose: Support utilities for resolving the canonical repo root, discovering the newest init_outputs.py candidate, executing it with captured output, and safely creating outputs/qa/ log paths with deterministic timestamp formatting.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_init_outputs_and_capture.py: Runnable script that locates and executes the most current init_outputs.py under runtime/outputs/code-creation, confirms and prints the canonical project root path, generates/updates the /outputs structure, and writes a timestamped console log to outputs/qa/ while preserving the full stdout/stderr of the run.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Support utilities for resolving the canonical repo root, discovering the newest init_outputs.py candidate, executing it with captured output, and safely creating outputs/qa/ log paths with deterministic timestamp formatting.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/_outputs_qa_utils.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/_outputs_qa_utils.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/_outputs_qa_utils.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
