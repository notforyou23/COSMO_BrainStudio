You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add a minimal smoke test target that runs first, capture full stdout/stderr into canonical artifacts under `/outputs/qa/exec_logs/`, and implement an automatic retry + environment dump (container image hash, resources, dependency versions) when the failure signature is detected.
Project: generated_script_1766627137280 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/qa_smoke_test.py
- Purpose: Minimal smoke test entrypoint designed to run first and quickly validate basic runtime assumptions (Python, filesystem, Docker availability) while emitting deterministic output for log capture.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/qa_run.py: End-to-end QA runner that executes a minimal smoke test first, captures full stdout/stderr into canonical artifacts under outputs/qa/exec_logs/, detects failure signatures, performs automatic retry, and writes an environment dump (container image hash, resources, dependency versions) on retry-triggered failures.
- scripts/env_dump.py: Environment introspection utility that collects container identity (image hash when available), host/container resources, OS details, and dependency versions and writes a structured dump to outputs/qa/exec_logs/ for failure triage.
- scripts/failure_signatures.py: Centralized catalog and matching logic for known unstable/unsupported-environment failure signatures used to trigger automatic retry and env dump behavior.
- scripts/exec_utils.py: Shared subprocess execution helpers that stream and tee stdout/stderr to canonical log files with timestamps, exit codes, and per-attempt metadata.

Key requirements:
- docker

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Minimal smoke test entrypoint designed to run first and quickly validate basic runtime assumptions (Python, filesystem, Docker availability) while emitting deterministic output for log capture.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/qa_smoke_test.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/qa_smoke_test.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/qa_smoke_test.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
