You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define v1 schema (fields + required/optional + enums for workstream type), then implement a minimal CLI (e.g., `python -m case_studies.add`) that creates a new case folder with a prefilled metadata file and runs schema validation before allowing commit.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766624721472 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: support/githooks/pre-commit
- Purpose: Git pre-commit hook that runs python -m case_studies.validate and blocks commits when schema validation fails.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/case_studies/__init__.py: Defines the case_studies package and exposes versioned schema utilities for external callers.
- src/case_studies/schema_v1.py: Implements the v1 metadata schema definition (fields, required/optional, enums) and a dependency-free validator.
- src/case_studies/paths.py: Provides canonical path rules and helpers for locating the case-studies root and per-case folder layout.
- src/case_studies/add.py: Implements the minimal CLI entrypoint (python -m case_studies.add) to scaffold a new case folder with prefilled metadata and validate it.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Git pre-commit hook that runs python -m case_studies.validate and blocks commits when schema validation fails.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('support/githooks/pre-commit')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:support/githooks/pre-commit')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside support/githooks/pre-commit.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
