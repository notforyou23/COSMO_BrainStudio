You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a case-study catalog implementation: define a machine-readable schema (JSON Schema or YAML spec) and build a small CLI/script to add a new case study (metadata + tags + citations + rights fields) into /outputs/catalog/ and validate entries against the schema.
Project: case-study catalog implementation: define a machine-readable schema (JSON Schema or YAML spec) and build a small CLI/script to add a new case study (metadata + tags + citations + rights fields) into /outputs/catalog/ and validate entries against the schema. (json cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: schemas/case-study.schema.json
- Purpose: JSON Schema defining the canonical machine-readable structure for a single case study including metadata, tags, citations, and rights fields.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- schemas/catalog.schema.json: JSON Schema defining the structure for the catalog index file that references all case study entries under outputs/catalog/.
- src/catalog_cli.py: Complete Python CLI tool to create/add a new case study JSON file into outputs/catalog/ and validate case study and catalog index against the schemas.
- src/catalog_lib.py: Library module implementing schema loading, validation, slug/id generation, file I/O, and catalog index updates used by the CLI.
- src/templates/case_study.stub.json: Fillable JSON template for a new case study entry used by the CLI when creating entries interactively or from defaults.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: JSON Schema defining the canonical machine-readable structure for a single case study including metadata, tags, citations, and rights fields.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('schemas/case-study.schema.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:schemas/case-study.schema.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside schemas/case-study.schema.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
