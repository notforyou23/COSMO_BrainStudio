You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a single script/Make target that runs scaffold generation and asserts presence/content of required files (REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE, QA reports), failing fast and writing results into /outputs/qa/.
Project: single (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: Makefile
- Purpose: Make targets to run the single QA pipeline (scaffold generation + assertions) via python tools/qa_run.py and ensure outputs/qa/ is produced.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- tools/qa_run.py: Single entrypoint script that generates scaffolding, validates required artifacts/content, fails fast on suggests fixes, and writes QA results into outputs/qa/.
- src/scaffold.py: Scaffolding generator that creates required directories and materializes REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE, and baseline QA report stubs from templates.
- src/specs.py: Machine-checkable specification of required files plus content assertions (markers/sections) used by qa_run to validate the scaffold deterministically.
- templates/REPORT_OUTLINE.md: Canonical report outline template used by the scaffolder and asserted by QA for required headings/markers.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Make targets to run the single QA pipeline (scaffold generation + assertions) via python tools/qa_run.py and ensure outputs/qa/ is produced.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('Makefile')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:Makefile')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside Makefile.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
