You are planning a python cli_tool implementation for the following mission:
Implement a one-command harness (e.g., scripts/run_pipeline.sh or python -m tools.pipeline) that runs init_outputs + validate_outputs and exits nonzero on failure; ensure it checks for the presence and minimal completeness of TRACKING_RECONCILIATION.md, Claim Cards, and QA gate artifacts.

Relevant context:
- [CONSOLIDATED] A robust delivery pipeline should include a single, canonical “QA gate” command that deterministically verifies required outp

Explicit requirements:
- ci cd

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
