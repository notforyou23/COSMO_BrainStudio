You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a one-command harness (e.g., scripts/run_pipeline.sh or python -m tools.pipeline) that runs init_outputs + validate_outputs and exits nonzero on failure; ensure it checks for the presence and minimal completeness of TRACKING_RECONCILIATION.md, Claim Cards, and QA gate artifacts.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766623930114 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: tools/pipeline.py
- Purpose: Implements the one-command harness that runs init_outputs then validate_outputs, performs required artifact presence/minimal-completeness checks, and exits nonzero on any failure.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- tools/__init__.py: Defines the tools package so the QA gate harness can be executed via python -m tools.pipeline.
- tools/qa_gate.py: Provides reusable orchestration helpers for running pipeline stages deterministically, capturing failures, and producing a concise QA gate report/exit code.
- tools/qa_artifacts.py: Implements concrete checks for TRACKING_RECONCILIATION.md, Claim Cards, and QA gate artifacts including minimal completeness heuristics and canonical path handling.
- scripts/run_pipeline.sh: Shell wrapper that invokes the canonical python QA gate command for local and CI usage with strict failure propagation.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Implements the one-command harness that runs init_outputs then validate_outputs, performs required artifact presence/minimal-completeness checks, and exits nonzero on any failure.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tools/pipeline.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tools/pipeline.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tools/pipeline.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
