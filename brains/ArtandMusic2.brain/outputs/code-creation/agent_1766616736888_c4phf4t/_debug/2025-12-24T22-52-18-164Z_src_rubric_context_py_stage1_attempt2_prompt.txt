Mission summary: Create /outputs/CASE_STUDY_RUBRIC.md with inclusion/exclusion criteria, scoring (impact, relevance to themes, availability of authoritative media URLs, rights clarity), and tagging rules that map to the taxonomy.
Project: /outputs/CASE_STUDY_RUBRIC.md with inclusion/exclusion criteria, scoring (impact, relevance to themes, availability of authoritative media URLs, rights clarity), and tagging rules that map to the taxonomy. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/rubric_context.py
- Purpose: Centralized context/constants module that captures relevant consolidated workflow and agent insights used to populate the rubric content deterministically.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/create_case_study_rubric.py: Python script that generates outputs/CASE_STUDY_RUBRIC.md with inclusion/exclusion criteria, scoring rubric, and taxonomy-mapped tagging rules derived from consolidated project context.
- src/taxonomy.py: Defines the project taxonomy and provides mapping helpers for rubric tagging rules to ensure tags align with approved categories and naming conventions.
- src/markdown_writer.py: Markdown rendering utilities to build a consistent, schema-driven CASE_STUDY_RUBRIC.md with headings, tables, and examples.
- outputs/CASE_STUDY_RUBRIC.md: Generated rubric document specifying inclusion/exclusion criteria, scoring dimensions (impact, relevance, authoritative media URLs, rights clarity), and tagging rules mapped to the taxonomy.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Centralized context/constants module that captures relevant consolidated workflow and agent insights used to populate the rubric content deterministically.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/rubric_context.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/rubric_context.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/rubric_context.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
