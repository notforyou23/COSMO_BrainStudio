You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Execute init_outputs.py to generate the /outputs structure; verify expected paths exist (e.g., /outputs/qa/, templates, reports) and record the run log under /outputs/qa/logs/.
Project: generated_configuration_1766627459964 (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: src/outputs_scaffold.py
- Purpose: Library module that loads the desired outputs structure, creates directories idempotently, performs existence verification, and returns a structured result for logging.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- init_outputs.py: CLI script that creates the required outputs directory scaffold, verifies expected paths, and writes a timestamped run log under outputs/qa/logs/.
- config/outputs_structure.json: Declarative configuration defining the expected outputs directory tree (e.g., outputs/qa/, templates, reports, logs) for scaffold creation and verification.
- src/path_utils.py: Utility helpers for safe path canonicalization and project-root-relative resolution to prevent accidental creation outside the repository.
- src/run_log.py: Small logging helper that formats and writes a run log (JSONL and/or text) into outputs/qa/logs/ with environment and verification details.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Library module that loads the desired outputs structure, creates directories idempotently, performs existence verification, and returns a structured result for logging.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/outputs_scaffold.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/outputs_scaffold.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/outputs_scaffold.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
