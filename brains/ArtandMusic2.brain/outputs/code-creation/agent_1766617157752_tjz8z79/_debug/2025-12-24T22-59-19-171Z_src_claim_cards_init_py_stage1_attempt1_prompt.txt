Mission summary: Add CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md (or CLAIM_CARD_TEMPLATE.md) with fields: claim text, scope, evidence type, citations/DOIs/URLs, verification status (unverified/partially/verified), and abstention triggers; require it for any new empirical claim in the pilot case study.
Project: generated_configuration_1766617158208 (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: src/claim_cards/__init__.py
- Purpose: Package initializer for claim card tooling used to validate and enforce the empirical-claim workflow.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- templates/CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md: Markdown template for creating new case studies with explicit sections that require linking each empirical claim to a claim card ID.
- templates/CLAIM_CARD_TEMPLATE.md: Markdown template for individual claim cards containing fields for claim text, scope, evidence type, citations/DOIs/URLs, verification status, and abstention triggers.
- config/claim_card_schema.json: JSON schema defining the required fields and allowed values for claim cards and the claim-to-case-study linkage rules.
- src/claim_cards/parser.py: Parser utilities to extract structured fields from claim card markdown and to extract empirical-claim references from case study markdown.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Package initializer for claim card tooling used to validate and enforce the empirical-claim workflow.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/claim_cards/__init__.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/claim_cards/__init__.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/claim_cards/__init__.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
