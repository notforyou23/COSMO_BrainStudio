## Scope & Research Question

- **In scope (what is included):**
- **Out of scope (what is excluded):**
- **Key definitions (operational, measurable where possible):**

## Source Context (non-claim narrative)
Briefly describe the setting, actors, and why this case study matters. Avoid empirical assertions here unless they are linked to a claim card (see rules below).

## Empirical-Claim Rule (Required)
Any *new empirical claim* introduced anywhere in this case study MUST be:
1) Added to **Empirical Claim Index** below,
2) Linked to exactly one **Claim Card ID** (a separate claim card document),
3) Marked with a **verification status** (unverified / partially_verified / verified).

If you cannot support a claim with a claim card, either remove it, rephrase as a non-empirical hypothesis/opinion, or add an abstention trigger explaining why you are not making the claim.

## Empirical Claim Index (Required)
List every empirical claim made in this case study. Each row must map to a claim card.

| Local Claim Ref | Claim Card ID | Claim (one sentence) | Scope (who/where/when) | Evidence type | Citations/DOIs/URLs | Verification status | Abstention triggers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EC-001 | CC-<id> |  |  | (e.g., RCT, observational, admin data, meta-analysis, qualitative, benchmark, audit, log analysis) |  | unverified / partially_verified / verified |  |

## Case Narrative (With Claim-Card Linking)
Write the narrative of the case. Every empirical assertion must include an inline reference to a Local Claim Ref, e.g., “... (EC-003)”.
Non-empirical content (interpretation, hypotheses, recommendations) should be clearly labeled as such.

## Empirical Claims (Expanded, One Section per Claim)
Create one subsection per Local Claim Ref (EC-###). Do not merge multiple empirical claims into one subsection.

### EC-001 — <Short label>
- **Claim card ID:** CC-<id>
- **Claim text (verbatim, one sentence):**
- **Scope:** (population/entity, geography, time window, conditions/assumptions)
- **Evidence type:** (choose one; add brief rationale)
- **Citations/DOIs/URLs:** (list all; include stable URLs/DOIs where possible)
- **Verification status:** unverified / partially_verified / verified
- **Abstention triggers:** (conditions under which you will not rely on this claim, e.g., missing replication, data inaccessible, confounding too severe)
- **Notes on uncertainties / limitations:** (optional but recommended)
- **How this claim is used in the case study:** (what decision/conclusion it supports)

## Methods & Data Handling (Case-Level)
- **Search / collection method:** (how sources were identified)
- **Inclusion / exclusion criteria for evidence:**
- **Data provenance notes:** (if any datasets are used, note access and versioning)
- **Confounders / alternative explanations considered:**
- **Known gaps / missing evidence:**

## Synthesis (Non-empirical Summary)
Summarize what the verified and partially verified claims jointly suggest, and what remains uncertain. Do not introduce new empirical claims here without adding them to the index and linking claim cards.

## Decisions / Recommendations (Clearly Labeled)
- **Recommendation(s):**
- **Decision thresholds / what would change your mind:**
- **Risks and mitigations:**
- **Equity / fairness considerations:**

## Appendix: Source List (Optional)
List key sources used across multiple claim cards (if helpful). This appendix does not replace required citations in claim cards.
