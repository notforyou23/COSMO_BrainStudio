You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a minimal smoke test that runs in the same environment as the failing job; capture full stdout/stderr to /outputs/qa/execution_smoketest_{timestamp}.log and /outputs/qa/execution_env.json (image/tag, resources), then iterate until stable.
Project: minimal smoke test that runs in the same environment as the failing job; capture full stdout/stderr to /outputs/qa/execution_smoketest_{timestamp}.log and /outputs/qa/execution_env.json (image/tag, resources), then iterate until stable. (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/execution_smoketest.sh
- Purpose: Shell wrapper to run the smoke test in the same container/job context, ensure /outputs/qa exists, and forward all output while preserving exit codes.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/execution_smoketest.py: Runnable smoke test that captures full stdout/stderr to a timestamped log under /outputs/qa, records execution environment metadata to /outputs/qa/execution_env.json, and exits nonzero on detected instability or unsupported conditions.
- config/execution_smoketest.json: Configuration file defining which environment signals to collect (image/tag heuristics, resource probes) and which checks to run or skip to keep the smoke test minimal yet fail-safe.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Shell wrapper to run the smoke test in the same container/job context, ensure /outputs/qa exists, and forward all output while preserving exit codes.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/execution_smoketest.sh')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/execution_smoketest.sh')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/execution_smoketest.sh.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
