You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define `runtime/outputs/schemas/CASE_STUDY.schema.json` and a starter record format; add a small script (e.g., `runtime/outputs/tools/new_case_study.py`) that generates a populated stub under `runtime/outputs/case_studies/<slug>/case_study.json` plus a `sources.bib` and `rights.md` placeholder.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766619950468 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: runtime/outputs/schemas/CASE_STUDY.schema.json
- Purpose: JSON Schema defining the canonical case study record format, required fields, and validation rules for runtime/outputs/case_studies/*/case_study.json files.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- runtime/outputs/tools/new_case_study.py: CLI script that creates a new case study directory under runtime/outputs/case_studies/<slug>/ and writes a populated case_study.json stub plus sources.bib and rights.md placeholders.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: JSON Schema defining the canonical case study record format, required fields, and validation rules for runtime/outputs/case_studies/*/case_study.json files.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('runtime/outputs/schemas/CASE_STUDY.schema.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:runtime/outputs/schemas/CASE_STUDY.schema.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside runtime/outputs/schemas/CASE_STUDY.schema.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
