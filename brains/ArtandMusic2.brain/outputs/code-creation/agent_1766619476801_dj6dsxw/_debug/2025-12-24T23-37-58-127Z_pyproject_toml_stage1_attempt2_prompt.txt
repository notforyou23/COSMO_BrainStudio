You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a minimal automated validation harness (e.g., a single command/script) that runs the scaffold generator and then verifies expected files exist in /outputs (REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md, METADATA_SCHEMA.md, CASE_STUDIES_INDEX.csv, rights artifacts) and outputs a pass/fail report saved under /outputs/qa/.
Project: minimal automated validation harness (e.g., a single command/script) that runs the scaffold generator and then verifies expected files exist in /outputs (REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md, METADATA_SCHEMA.md, CASE_STUDIES_INDEX.csv, rights artifacts) and outputs a pass/fail report saved under /outputs/qa/. (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: pyproject.toml
- Purpose: Project configuration defining the minimal Python package layout and an entry-point script for the validation harness.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/validate_scaffold.py: Single-command validation harness that runs the scaffold generator, verifies required artifacts in outputs/, and writes a pass/fail QA report under outputs/qa/.
- src/qa/validator.py: Core validation logic for locating project root, invoking the generator deterministically, checking expected files (including rights artifacts), and producing structured results.
- src/qa/reporting.py: Utilities to render validation results as a human-readable report and machine-readable JSON saved to outputs/qa/.
- src/qa/paths.py: Path and filesystem helpers to resolve outputs directories, enforce deterministic locations, and support cross-platform execution.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Project configuration defining the minimal Python package layout and an entry-point script for the validation harness.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('pyproject.toml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:pyproject.toml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside pyproject.toml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
