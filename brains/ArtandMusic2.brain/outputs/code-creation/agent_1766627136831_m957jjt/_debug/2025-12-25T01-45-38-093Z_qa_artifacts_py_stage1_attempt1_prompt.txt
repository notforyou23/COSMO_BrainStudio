You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create `scripts/qa_run.sh` (or `python -m qa.run`) that (1) generates/collects artifacts, (2) checks required output paths, and (3) writes `/outputs/qa/qa_summary.json` + `/outputs/qa/qa_summary.md` with run metadata (time, git SHA, inputs).
Project: `scripts/qa_run.sh` (or `python -m qa.run`) that (1) generates/collects artifacts, (2) checks required output paths, and (3) writes `/outputs/qa/qa_summary.json` + `/outputs/qa/qa_summary.md` with run metadata (time, git SHA, inputs). (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: qa/artifacts.py
- Purpose: Artifact generation/collection utilities invoked by the QA runner to produce and/or aggregate intermediate QA artifacts into canonical output locations.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/qa_run.sh: Single-entry CLI shell script that runs the QA pipeline by generating/collecting artifacts, validating required output paths, and producing /outputs/qa/qa_summary.json and /outputs/qa/qa_summary.md with run metadata.
- qa/__init__.py: QA package initializer enabling python -m qa.run execution and exposing package version/metadata helpers.
- qa/run.py: Main QA runner implementing artifact generation/collection, required path checks, metadata capture (time, git SHA, inputs), and writing qa_summary.json and qa_summary.md under outputs/qa.
- qa/validate.py: Output validation module that checks required output paths, file presence, and basic integrity, returning structured results for inclusion in the QA summary.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Artifact generation/collection utilities invoked by the QA runner to produce and/or aggregate intermediate QA artifacts into canonical output locations.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('qa/artifacts.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:qa/artifacts.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside qa/artifacts.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
