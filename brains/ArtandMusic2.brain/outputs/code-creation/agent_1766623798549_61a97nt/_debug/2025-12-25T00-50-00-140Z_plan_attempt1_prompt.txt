You are planning a python script implementation for the following mission:
Create a focused remediation patch that adds a 'no-container/failsafe execution mode' to the QA runner scripts (e.g., graceful degradation, reduced test set, clear error capture) so that execution does not terminate with 'container lost' without producing logs and partial results; document the run command in /outputs/qa/RUN_INSTRUCTIONS.md.

Explicit requirements:
- docker

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
