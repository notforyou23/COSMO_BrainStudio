You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a one-command script (e.g., make validate) that (1) runs scaffold generation, then (2) asserts presence of required artifacts in /outputs (DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md, CASE_STUDY_RUBRIC.md, TRACKING_RECONCILIATION.md, plus any required index), and fails CI/QA if outputs are elsewhere.
Project: generated_script_1766617157946 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/run_scaffold.py
- Purpose: Runs the project scaffold generation step (invoking the existing generator if present) and ensures it completes successfully for use in CI/QA.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/validate_outputs.py: Validates that required artifacts exist exactly under outputs/ (DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md, CASE_STUDY_RUBRIC.md, TRACKING_RECONCILIATION.md, and an index file) and fails if any are missing or found elsewhere.
- Makefile: Provides a single-command validate target that runs scaffold generation then output validation and exits nonzero on any failure for CI/QA enforcement.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Runs the project scaffold generation step (invoking the existing generator if present) and ensures it completes successfully for use in CI/QA.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/run_scaffold.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/run_scaffold.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/run_scaffold.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
