You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Canonicalize and migrate deliverables from agent-specific paths (e.g., .../code-creation/... and document-creation outputs) into a single canonical tree under runtime/outputs/. Update runtime/outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json to point to the migrated canonical files and generate runtime/outputs/CANONICALIZATION_REPORT.md documenting old->new mappings.
Project: generated_script_1766619667635 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: runtime/outputs/CANONICALIZATION_REPORT.md
- Purpose: Generated report file (created if missing) documenting canonicalization results, including old->new path mappings and any errors or skipped items.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/canonicalize_outputs.py: Standalone script that discovers agent-specific deliverables, migrates/copies them into runtime/outputs/ canonical subfolders, updates runtime/outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json to point at new paths, and generates runtime/outputs/CANONICALIZATION_REPORT.md with old-to-new mappings and actions taken.
- scripts/lib/output_discovery.py: Library module that scans the repository for deliverables under known agent output roots (e.g., code-creation, document-creation, and other agent-stamped directories) and returns structured records with metadata used for canonicalization.
- scripts/lib/path_canonicalizer.py: Library module that defines canonical destination rules under runtime/outputs/ (naming, collision handling, hashing, and folder taxonomy) and computes deterministic old->new path mappings.
- scripts/lib/project_tracker_updater.py: Library module that loads runtime/outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json, rewrites tracked artifact paths to their canonical equivalents, preserves formatting/ordering where possible, and validates that all referenced files exist post-migration.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Generated report file (created if missing) documenting canonicalization results, including old->new path mappings and any errors or skipped items.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('runtime/outputs/CANONICALIZATION_REPORT.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:runtime/outputs/CANONICALIZATION_REPORT.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside runtime/outputs/CANONICALIZATION_REPORT.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
