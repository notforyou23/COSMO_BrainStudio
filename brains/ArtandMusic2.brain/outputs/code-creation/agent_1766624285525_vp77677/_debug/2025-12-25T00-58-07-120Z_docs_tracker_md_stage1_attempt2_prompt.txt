You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Select the canonical entry point (prefer existing validate_outputs.py + one runner) and create/standardize one command that produces only the canonical /outputs/qa/* artifacts; update docs/tracker to point exclusively to this command.
Project: generated_script_1766624286042 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: docs/tracker.md
- Purpose: Tracker page updated to reference only the canonical QA command and to treat /outputs/qa/* as the sole supported artifact location for QA evidence and validation.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/qa_run.py: Canonical single-command QA runner CLI that executes the configured QA workflow and writes only the standardized /outputs/qa/<run_id>/ artifact tree (including an explicit index) and then invokes validate_outputs.py on the produced artifacts.
- scripts/qa_artifacts.py: Shared utilities for canonicalizing paths, generating run IDs, writing the /outputs/qa index/manifest files, and enforcing that no artifacts are written outside /outputs/qa during a run.
- docs/qa.md: Documentation that defines the single canonical QA command (python scripts/qa_run.py ...) and describes the required /outputs/qa artifact structure and index files produced by that command.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Tracker page updated to reference only the canonical QA command and to treat /outputs/qa/* as the sole supported artifact location for QA evidence and validation.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('docs/tracker.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:docs/tracker.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside docs/tracker.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
