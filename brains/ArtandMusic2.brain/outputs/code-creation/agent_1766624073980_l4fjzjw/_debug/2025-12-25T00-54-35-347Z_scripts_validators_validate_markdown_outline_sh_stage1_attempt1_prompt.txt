You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a single entrypoint script/command (e.g., scripts/run_validation_harness.sh) that: (1) runs the scaffold generator, (2) checks for required files under /outputs (e.g., REPORT_OUTLINE.md, templates, pilot case), and (3) runs validators; fail with clear error messages when artifacts are missing.
Project: single entrypoint (bash configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/validators/validate_markdown_outline.sh
- Purpose: Bash validator that checks REPORT_OUTLINE.md exists and meets minimal structural expectations (non-empty, required headings/sections) for downstream tooling.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_validation_harness.sh: Single entrypoint Bash script that runs the scaffold generator, verifies required /outputs artifacts exist, then runs validators and fails fast with clear error messages when anything is missing or invalid.
- scripts/lib/harness_common.sh: Shared Bash helper library for consistent logging, error handling, path resolution, and required-artifact checks used by the validation harness.
- scripts/validators/validate_outputs_structure.sh: Bash validator that enforces a machine-checkable outputs directory structure (required files, templates directory, and pilot case presence) and exits nonzero with actionable messages.
- scripts/validators/validate_templates.sh: Bash validator that checks required template files exist under /outputs/templates and are non-empty, reporting missing or empty templates clearly.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Bash validator that checks REPORT_OUTLINE.md exists and meets minimal structural expectations (non-empty, required headings/sections) for downstream tooling.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/validators/validate_markdown_outline.sh')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/validators/validate_markdown_outline.sh')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/validators/validate_markdown_outline.sh.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
