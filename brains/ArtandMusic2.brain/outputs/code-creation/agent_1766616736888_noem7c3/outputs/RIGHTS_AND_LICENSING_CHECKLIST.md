# Rights & Licensing Checklist (Assets)

Use this checklist to verify that every asset (image, video, audio, font, dataset, icon, code snippet, document, screenshot) has documented rights, a valid license, and correct attribution before publication.

## 1) Asset identification (required)
- [ ] Assign a unique `asset_id` (stable across revisions).
- [ ] Record the source URL(s) and any download/landing pages.
- [ ] Capture the original filename, format, and a content description.
- [ ] If the asset was edited, document what changed (crop, color, remix, transcription, etc.).

## 2) Source authenticity & provenance
- [ ] Confirm the URL is the original source (publisher/author/official repository), not a repost.
- [ ] Verify the asset is not mislabeled (reverse image search / checksum / repository history when applicable).
- [ ] Identify the rightsholder (person/organization) and any agent/stock library involved.
- [ ] If multiple contributors exist (e.g., band photos, multi-author datasets), note who owns what.

## 3) License verification (must be evidence-based)
- [ ] Identify the license type (e.g., CC BY 4.0, CC BY-SA, CC0, MIT, Shutterstock commercial, custom permission, public domain).
- [ ] Save evidence of the license as of the verification date:
  - [ ] Screenshot/PDF of license page, or repository LICENSE file commit hash.
  - [ ] Terms for the specific asset (not just the site’s general terms).
- [ ] Confirm the license actually applies to the asset (not only to the page text or unrelated content).
- [ ] Confirm version and jurisdiction details if relevant (e.g., CC 3.0 vs 4.0).
- [ ] For “public domain” claims, verify basis (expiration, government work, CC0 dedication, etc.).

## 4) Usage permissions (match your intended use)
- [ ] Confirm permitted media/channel: web, print, social, broadcast, app, internal-only, etc.
- [ ] Confirm permitted purpose: commercial vs non-commercial; editorial vs advertising.
- [ ] Confirm whether modifications are allowed (derivatives/remixes).
- [ ] Confirm redistribution rights (can you bundle or rehost the asset?).
- [ ] Confirm sublicensing/transferability (can downstream users reuse it?).

## 5) Attribution requirements (write the exact text)
- [ ] Determine required attribution fields (creator, title, source link, license link, notices).
- [ ] Write the exact attribution text to be used verbatim (including links where required).
- [ ] If edits were made, include modification notice when required (e.g., “cropped”, “color adjusted”).
- [ ] If attribution is not required (e.g., CC0), document why and any courtesy credit.

## 6) Restrictions & obligations (document explicitly)
- [ ] Non-commercial (NC) restriction checked and compatible with intended use.
- [ ] ShareAlike (SA) obligations understood for derivatives and distribution.
- [ ] NoDerivatives (ND) restriction checked (no edits if ND applies).
- [ ] Editorial-only limitations (no product endorsement/ads) checked.
- [ ] Territory, time, placement, run-length, audience size, or exclusivity limits noted.
- [ ] Required notices retained (copyright, trademark, watermark, moral rights).
- [ ] Model/property releases assessed if people, private property, or trademarks are prominent.
- [ ] Privacy/biometric considerations reviewed for identifiable individuals.

## 7) Sensitive content & compliance checks (as applicable)
- [ ] Minors: confirm consent/release and safe-use policies.
- [ ] Medical/legal/financial content: ensure disclaimer needs are met.
- [ ] Cultural/community permissions considered where relevant.
- [ ] AI-generated content: verify tool terms, training data constraints (if known), and disclosure policy.

## 8) Internal storage & traceability
- [ ] Store the asset file in the approved location with `asset_id` in the filename if possible.
- [ ] Store license evidence (screenshots, PDFs, emails) alongside the asset record.
- [ ] Record verification date and reviewer name.
- [ ] Ensure the asset is listed in `outputs/RIGHTS_LOG.csv` with complete fields.

## 9) Reviewer sign-off (required before release)
Reviewer must confirm:
- [ ] License evidence is archived and readable.
- [ ] License type matches the asset and intended use.
- [ ] Attribution text is correct and included where the asset appears.
- [ ] Restrictions are satisfied (or asset is excluded).
- [ ] Any releases/consents are obtained and archived (if needed).

### Sign-off
- Project/Deliverable:
- Asset range covered (asset_id(s)):
- Verification date (YYYY-MM-DD):
- Reviewer (name + role):
- Notes/Exceptions (if any):

By signing off, the reviewer attests that reasonable due diligence was performed and that rights/permissions are accurately recorded for the intended use.
