Mission summary: Implement a link-check runner that reads exemplar URLs from case-study JSON and writes results to `runtime/outputs/qa/linkcheck_report.json` (status codes, redirects, last-checked timestamp) and a human-readable summary `runtime/outputs/qa/LINKCHECK_SUMMARY.md`.
Project: generated_script_1766615159468 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/qa/linkcheck.py
- Purpose: Core link-check library providing URL extraction from case-study JSON, HTTP checking logic (redirect chains, timeouts, retries), and report/summary generation helpers.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/linkcheck_runner.py: CLI runner that loads exemplar URLs from case-study JSON files, checks them (status/redirects), and writes runtime/outputs/qa/linkcheck_report.json and runtime/outputs/qa/LINKCHECK_SUMMARY.md.
- src/qa/linkcheck_types.py: Dataclasses and type definitions for link-check inputs/outputs to keep report schema consistent and easy to validate.
- src/qa/linkcheck_io.py: Filesystem utilities for discovering case-study JSON files, reading/writing the report JSON, and emitting the Markdown summary under runtime/outputs/qa.
- src/qa/user_agent.py: Shared user-agent and polite request defaults (headers, rate limiting settings) used by the link-check runner.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Core link-check library providing URL extraction from case-study JSON, HTTP checking logic (redirect chains, timeouts, retries), and report/summary generation helpers.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/qa/linkcheck.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/qa/linkcheck.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/qa/linkcheck.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
