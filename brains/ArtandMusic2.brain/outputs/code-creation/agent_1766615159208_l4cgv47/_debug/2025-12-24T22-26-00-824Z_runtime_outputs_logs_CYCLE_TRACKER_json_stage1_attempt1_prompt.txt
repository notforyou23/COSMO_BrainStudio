You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add a lightweight tracker file (e.g., `runtime/outputs/logs/CYCLE_TRACKER.json`) that records cycle id/date, expected artifacts, validation status, and links to QA reports; require it to be updated by the validation harness.
Project: generated_script_1766615159413 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: runtime/outputs/logs/CYCLE_TRACKER.json
- Purpose: Lightweight persistent JSON tracker storing cycle metadata, expected artifacts, validation status, and links/paths to QA reports for each run.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/cycle_tracker.py: Utility module that defines the cycle tracker JSON schema, reads/writes/updates entries atomically, and provides helpers for linking validation/QA outputs.
- scripts/validate_outputs.py: Validation harness that checks for required artifacts, generates/collects QA report paths, and updates runtime/outputs/logs/CYCLE_TRACKER.json on every run with cycle id/date, expectations, and pass/fail status.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Lightweight persistent JSON tracker storing cycle metadata, expected artifacts, validation status, and links/paths to QA reports for each run.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('runtime/outputs/logs/CYCLE_TRACKER.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:runtime/outputs/logs/CYCLE_TRACKER.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside runtime/outputs/logs/CYCLE_TRACKER.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
