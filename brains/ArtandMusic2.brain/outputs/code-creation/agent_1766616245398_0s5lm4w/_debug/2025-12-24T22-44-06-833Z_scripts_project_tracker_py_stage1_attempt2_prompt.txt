You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a minimal tracking system to resolve the 'ACTUALLY PURSUED: 0' inconsistency: create a single source-of-truth progress ledger (e.g., /outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json or .csv) plus a small script that updates counts per goal and lists current active goals for each cycle.
Project: single source-of-truth progress ledger (e.g., /outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json or .csv) plus a small (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/project_tracker.py
- Purpose: Command-line script that creates and maintains a single source-of-truth progress ledger (JSON/CSV) by updating per-goal counts, recording per-cycle snapshots, and printing current active goals for each cycle to resolve the 'ACTUALLY PURSUED: 0' inconsistency.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json: Single source-of-truth progress ledger storing goals, per-cycle activity, and aggregate counts that the tracker script reads and updates deterministically.
- outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.csv: Optional human-readable/exportable mirror of the progress ledger with one row per goal per cycle and computed totals for easy inspection and spreadsheet use.
- documentation/PROJECT_TRACKER.md: Usage documentation describing the ledger schema, supported commands (init/goal/cycle/update/status/export), and the intended workflow integration to keep counts consistent across cycles.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Command-line script that creates and maintains a single source-of-truth progress ledger (JSON/CSV) by updating per-goal counts, recording per-cycle snapshots, and printing current active goals for each cycle to resolve the 'ACTUALLY PURSUED: 0' inconsistency.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/project_tracker.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/project_tracker.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/project_tracker.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
