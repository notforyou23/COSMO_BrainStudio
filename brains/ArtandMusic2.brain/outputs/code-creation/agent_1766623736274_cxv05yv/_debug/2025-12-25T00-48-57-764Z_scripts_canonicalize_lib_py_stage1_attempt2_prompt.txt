You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Perform a canonicalization pass by scanning agent-specific and runtime/outputs locations and migrating the best-known deliverables into the chosen canonical /outputs structure; produce a canonicalization report (moved files, collisions, chosen winners) under /outputs/tracking/ or /outputs/qa/.
Project: generated_script_1766623736477 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/_canonicalize_lib.py
- Purpose: Reusable library implementing discovery, scoring, collision resolution, safe move/copy, and report generation logic used by the canonicalization script.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/canonicalize_outputs.py: Python CLI tool that scans agent-specific and runtime output locations, selects best-known deliverables, migrates them into canonical /outputs structure, and writes a detailed canonicalization report under outputs/tracking/ or outputs/qa/ including moves, collisions, and chosen winners.
- scripts/qa_run_canonicalization.sh: Shell script that executes the canonicalization CLI with sensible defaults and exits nonzero on failure for QA/runtime automation.
- outputs/tracking/.gitkeep: Placeholder file to ensure outputs/tracking directory exists for canonicalization reports in clean checkouts.
- outputs/qa/.gitkeep: Placeholder file to ensure outputs/qa directory exists for canonicalization reports when QA mode is used.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Reusable library implementing discovery, scoring, collision resolution, safe move/copy, and report generation logic used by the canonicalization script.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/_canonicalize_lib.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/_canonicalize_lib.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/_canonicalize_lib.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
