You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create /outputs/ARTIFACT_INDEX.md listing each required deliverable, its canonical path under /outputs, and (if applicable) legacy runtime/outputs location + migration status; update the tracker (e.g., PROJECT_TRACKER.json) to reference only canonical paths.
Project: /outputs/ARTIFACT_INDEX.md listing each required deliverable, its canonical path under /outputs, and (if applicable) legacy runtime/outputs location + migration status; update the tracker (e.g., PROJECT_TRACKER.json) to reference only canonical paths. (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: support/required_deliverables.json
- Purpose: Declarative list of required deliverables including canonical /outputs paths, optional legacy runtime/outputs locations, and metadata used by the discoverability script.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/artifact_discoverability_fix.py: Single runnable Python script that discovers required deliverables, generates outputs/ARTIFACT_INDEX.md with canonical and legacy paths plus migration status, and updates the tracker JSON to reference only canonical /outputs paths.
- outputs/ARTIFACT_INDEX.md: Canonical artifact index markdown file listing each required deliverable with its /outputs path and any legacy locations with migration status, generated/maintained by the discoverability script.
- docs/ARTIFACT_INDEX_AND_TRACKER_MAINTENANCE.md: Documentation explaining how to run the discoverability script, how deliverables are defined, and how tracker path canonicalization works and is verified.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Declarative list of required deliverables including canonical /outputs paths, optional legacy runtime/outputs locations, and metadata used by the discoverability script.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('support/required_deliverables.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:support/required_deliverables.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside support/required_deliverables.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
