You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Canonicalize deliverables by selecting ONE authoritative QA runner + ONE authoritative schema from the existing created files, then migrate/copy the best-known versions into a single canonical /outputs/ tree and generate a refreshed /outputs/ARTIFACT_INDEX.md that points only to canonical paths (not agent-specific runtime/outputs locations).
Project: generated_script_1766627459880 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/lib/canonicalize/migrate.py
- Purpose: Safe migration/copy routines that create the canonical outputs/ tree, copy selected artifacts with collision handling, and optionally prune superseded canonical files.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/canonicalize_outputs.py: End-to-end canonicalization CLI that scans scattered agent/runtime output locations, selects one authoritative QA runner and one authoritative schema, copies/migrates chosen artifacts into a single canonical outputs/ tree, and regenerates outputs/ARTIFACT_INDEX.md with canonical paths only.
- scripts/lib/canonicalize/__init__.py: Package initializer for canonicalization library code used by the canonicalize_outputs script.
- scripts/lib/canonicalize/discovery.py: Filesystem discovery utilities that locate candidate QA runners, schema files, and output artifacts across agent/runtime directories with ignore rules and deterministic ordering.
- scripts/lib/canonicalize/selection.py: Deterministic scoring and selection logic to choose a single authoritative QA runner and schema based on heuristics (recency, completeness, validation success, and naming conventions).

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Safe migration/copy routines that create the canonical outputs/ tree, copy selected artifacts with collision handling, and optionally prune superseded canonical files.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/lib/canonicalize/migrate.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/lib/canonicalize/migrate.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/lib/canonicalize/migrate.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
