You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a single command that (a) runs the QA gate against DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md + pilot artifacts, then (b) emits QA_REPORT.json and QA_REPORT.md with per-check status, error messages, and remediation pointers.
Project: generated_script_1766622114585 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: qa/checks.py
- Purpose: Defines the catalog of QA checks and executes them over the report and artifact inputs, returning normalized per-check results and remediation guidance.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- qa/run.py: Implements a single CLI entrypoint that runs the QA gate against DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md plus pilot artifacts and emits QA_REPORT.json and QA_REPORT.md with per-check status, errors, and remediation pointers.
- qa/io.py: Provides robust filesystem discovery and loading utilities for DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md and pilot artifacts with path canonicalization and safe reads.
- qa/report.py: Renders and writes QA_REPORT.json and QA_REPORT.md from normalized check results including summary, per-check status, and remediation pointers.
- qa/schema.py: Defines the JSON schema (as Python structures) and validation helpers for the QA report output format to ensure machine-validated structure.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines the catalog of QA checks and executes them over the report and artifact inputs, returning normalized per-check results and remediation guidance.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('qa/checks.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:qa/checks.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside qa/checks.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
