Mission summary: Update the intake checklist to hard-require dataset identifier (name + DOI/link) for the dataset-verification pilot claim; add a validation rule that blocks work if only a vague “research area” is provided.
Project: generated_script_1766624151594 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/intake/validate_intake.py
- Purpose: Implements full intake checklist validation (schema + custom rules) including blocking work when dataset verification is selected without dataset name and DOI/link or when only a research area is provided.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- config/intake_checklist.schema.json: Defines the machine-validated intake checklist JSON Schema that hard-requires a dataset identifier (name plus DOI/link) for dataset-verification pilot claims and rejects entries that provide only a vague research area.
- config/intake_checklist.template.json: Provides a ready-to-fill intake checklist template updated to include explicit dataset name and DOI/link fields for dataset-verification pilot claims and guidance to avoid vague research-area-only inputs.
- scripts/validate_intake.py: CLI entrypoint that validates an intake checklist file against the updated rules and exits nonzero with actionable error messages when blocked.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Implements full intake checklist validation (schema + custom rules) including blocking work when dataset verification is selected without dataset name and DOI/link or when only a research area is provided.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/intake/validate_intake.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/intake/validate_intake.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/intake/validate_intake.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
