You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create /outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json (or .csv) with fields for goal_id, description, priority, progress_pct, qa_status, last_updated; then add a small script (e.g., scripts/update_tracker.py) that updates it and generates TRACKING_RECONCILIATION.md from the ledger.
Project: /outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json (or .csv) with fields for goal_id, description, priority, progress_pct, qa_status, last_updated; then add a small (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json
- Purpose: Machine-readable project tracker ledger containing an array of goals with fields goal_id, description, priority, progress_pct, qa_status, and last_updated.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/update_tracker.py: CLI script that loads/updates outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json and generates TRACKING_RECONCILIATION.md summarizing and validating tracker entries against the ledger.
- TRACKING_RECONCILIATION.md: Generated markdown reconciliation report derived from outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json showing current status, validation results, and a summary table of goals.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Machine-readable project tracker ledger containing an array of goals with fields goal_id, description, priority, progress_pct, qa_status, and last_updated.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
