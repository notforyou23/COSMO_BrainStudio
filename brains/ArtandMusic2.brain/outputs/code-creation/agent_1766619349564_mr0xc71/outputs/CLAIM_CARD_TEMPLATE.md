# Claim Card (Template)

## Intake Checklist (must pass before analysis)
To proceed, you must provide **all required fields** below. If any required field is missing, uncertain, or non-verbatim, **abstain** (see "Abstention criteria").

### Required fields (no exceptions)
1) **Claim text (verbatim)**  
- Paste the **exact words** of the claim as stated in the source.  
- Do **not** paraphrase, summarize, “clean up,” translate, or correct grammar.  
- If the claim is partly implied, you must quote the **specific** sentence(s) that assert it.

2) **Context (speaker + date + link)**  
- **Speaker/Author:** who said/wrote it (person, org, or publication).  
- **Date:** when it was said/published (YYYY-MM-DD preferred; otherwise the most precise available).  
- **Link:** URL to the source (canonical link preferred). If no public URL exists, provide a stable internal reference.

3) **Provenance anchor (precise locator inside the source)**  
Provide at least one of:
- **Direct quote span + locator:** page number, paragraph number, section heading, timestamp (for audio/video), or line range.  
- **Timestamp:** HH:MM:SS–HH:MM:SS for audio/video.  
- **Page/figure/table:** e.g., p. 12, Fig. 3, Table 2.  
- **Archived reference:** web.archive.org link and capture date (if the source is mutable).  
The goal: a reviewer can jump directly to the exact place the claim appears.

### Validation rules (hard failures)
- The **claim text must be verbatim**; if you cannot quote it exactly, abstain.  
- **Speaker/Author, Date, Link, and Provenance anchor are required**; if any are missing, abstain.  
- If multiple sources exist, select the **primary/earliest** source for the quote; list secondary sources separately.  
- If the claim is a compound statement, either:
  - quote the single sentence that contains the full claim, or
  - split into multiple claim cards with separate verbatim quotes and anchors.

### Abstention criteria (must stop and request missing info)
Abstain and request clarification if ANY of the following applies:
- No direct quote can be provided (only paraphrase/summary available).
- Speaker/Author is unknown or ambiguous.
- Date is missing/unknown beyond a broad range (e.g., “sometime in 2020”) and cannot be narrowed.
- No working link, no stable reference, or source is inaccessible.
- No provenance anchor (timestamp/page/section/etc.) that points to the exact location of the claim.
- The quoted text is not the claim itself (e.g., it is commentary about the claim, not the claim).
