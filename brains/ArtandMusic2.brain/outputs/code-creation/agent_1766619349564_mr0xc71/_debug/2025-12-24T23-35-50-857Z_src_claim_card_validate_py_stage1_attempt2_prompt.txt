Mission summary: Create a Claim Card template (markdown + machine-readable YAML/JSON) and workflow doc, then use it to run the 3-claim pilot and log failure modes (missing metadata, version ambiguity, correction history).
Project: Claim Card template (markdown + machine-readable YAML/JSON) and workflow doc, then use it to run the 3-claim pilot and log failure modes (missing metadata, version ambiguity, correction history). (json configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: src/claim_card/validate.py
- Purpose: Implements a CLI-capable validator that loads Claim Card YAML/JSON, validates against the schema, and emits structured failure-mode logs (missing metadata, version ambiguity, correction history issues).
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- config/claim_card.schema.json: Defines the machine-readable JSON Schema for Claim Cards including required metadata, versioning, provenance, and correction history fields.
- outputs/CLAIM_CARD_TEMPLATE.md: Provides the human-friendly Markdown Claim Card template with embedded YAML front matter aligned to the schema and containing all mandatory fields.
- docs/CLAIM_CARD_WORKFLOW.md: Documents the end-to-end workflow for creating Claim Cards, validating them, running the 3-claim pilot, and logging failure modes and corrections.
- src/claim_card/parse_md.py: Parses Markdown Claim Cards with YAML front matter into normalized JSON objects suitable for schema validation and pilot logging.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Implements a CLI-capable validator that loads Claim Card YAML/JSON, validates against the schema, and emits structured failure-mode logs (missing metadata, version ambiguity, correction history issues).
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/claim_card/validate.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/claim_card/validate.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/claim_card/validate.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
