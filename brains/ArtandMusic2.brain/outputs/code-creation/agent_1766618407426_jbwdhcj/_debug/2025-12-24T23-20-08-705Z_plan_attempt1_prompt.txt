You are planning a yaml configuration implementation for the following mission:
Add /outputs/templates/CLAIM_CARD.md (or .yaml) plus /outputs/workflows/CLAIM_VERIFICATION_WORKFLOW.md specifying required inputs (verbatim claim, source/context, provenance anchor), validation rules, and status lifecycle; wire these requirements into the QA gate.

Relevant context:

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
