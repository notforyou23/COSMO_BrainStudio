## Executive summary (1–2 pages)
- Problem statement and why it matters now
- Core findings (3–7 bullets, evidence-backed)
- Key recommendations (3–7 bullets, actionable, owner + timeframe)
- Expected impacts, costs, and major risks
- How to use this report (what decisions it supports)

## Context and objectives
### 1. Background and scope
- System / domain overview
- In-scope and out-of-scope items
- Definitions and terminology
- Stakeholders and affected groups

### 2. Research questions and success criteria
- Primary research questions
- Decision criteria / evaluation rubric
- Constraints (budget, time, regulatory, operational)

## Evidence and methods
### 3. Data sources and evidence standards
- Primary data sources (collection dates, provenance, access controls)
- Secondary sources (literature, benchmarks, public datasets)
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Credibility and conflict-of-interest checks

### 4. Methodology
- Study design (observational, experimental, mixed methods)
- Sampling approach and representativeness
- Measures, instruments, and operational definitions
- Analysis approach (quant/qual), tools, and validation steps
- Reproducibility notes (what is needed to replicate)

### 5. Limitations and uncertainty
- Known limitations, biases, and failure modes
- Sensitivity analyses or robustness checks performed
- Uncertainty communication (ranges, confidence, qualitative caveats)

## Findings
### 6. Key findings (organized by question/theme)
For each finding:
- Claim (clear, falsifiable)
- Evidence summary (data + method + result)
- Magnitude / practical significance
- Equity / distributional impacts (who benefits, who is burdened)
- Counterevidence and alternative explanations
- Confidence assessment (high/medium/low) with rationale

### 7. Mechanisms and causal story (if applicable)
- Proposed causal pathway(s)
- Confounders considered and how addressed
- Selection effects / feedback loops / second-order effects

### 8. Comparative analysis (optional)
- Baselines and benchmarks
- Alternatives compared (status quo, option A/B/C)
- Trade-offs (cost, performance, risk, equity, feasibility)

## Case studies (if used)
### 9. Case study synthesis
- Selection rationale and coverage of contexts
- Cross-case patterns and divergences
- Transferability considerations

- Use the companion template: outputs/CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md (include one appendix per case if needed)

## Recommendations and plan
### 10. Recommendations (ranked and justified)
For each recommendation:
- What to do (specific action)
- Owner(s) and decision point
- Timeline (near/mid/long term)
- Expected benefits and affected groups
- Required resources and dependencies
- Risks and mitigations
- Success metrics and monitoring plan

### 11. Implementation roadmap
- Workstreams and milestones
- Governance and accountability model
- Operational readiness (people/process/tech)
- Change management and communications

### 12. Measurement, monitoring, and evaluation
- Metrics (leading/lagging), definitions, and data collection plan
- Disaggregation plan (equity monitoring where relevant)
- Audit/assurance plan (internal/external)
- Feedback loops and iteration cadence

## Risk, safety, and compliance
### 13. Risk assessment
- Technical, operational, legal, reputational risks
- Misuse/abuse scenarios and safeguards
- Residual risk and acceptance criteria

### 14. Ethics and equity review
- Potential disparate impacts and mitigation strategies
- Accessibility and inclusion considerations
- Stakeholder participation and grievance mechanisms

## Conclusion
### 15. Summary of what changes and what stays the same
- Decisions required
- Open questions and next steps

## References and appendices
### A. References
- Use a consistent citation style throughout (APA/Chicago/IEEE acceptable; choose one and apply consistently)
- Prefer primary sources; include DOIs/URLs and access dates for web sources
- Cite datasets and software (name, version, repository, commit if applicable)

### B. Data and artifact inventory
- List key datasets, instruments, code, and outputs with locations and access restrictions
- Metadata should conform to the project schema: outputs/METADATA_SCHEMA.json (or .yml if used)

### C. Rights, licensing, and attribution (required)
- Confirm completion of: outputs/RIGHTS_AND_LICENSING_CHECKLIST.md
- Record permissions, licenses, and attribution requirements in: outputs/RIGHTS_LOG.csv
- For each external asset (images, tables, quotes, datasets, charts): include source, license, and attribution text

### D. Supplementary analyses (optional)
- Additional tables/figures, robustness checks, model cards, interview guides, etc.
