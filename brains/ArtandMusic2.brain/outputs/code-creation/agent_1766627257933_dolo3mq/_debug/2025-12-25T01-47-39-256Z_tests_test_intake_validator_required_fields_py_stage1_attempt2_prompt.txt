You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Codify these as required fields in the intake checklist + validator rules (hard-fail if claim text or dataset anchor is missing) and add an example template showing compliant vs non-compliant inputs for primary-source verification.
Project: generated_configuration_1766627258175 (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_intake_validator_required_fields.py
- Purpose: Unit tests asserting the validator hard-fails when claim text or dataset anchor is missing and passes when both are present and well-formed.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/claims/intake_fields.py: Defines the required intake fields and their semantics (including claim text and dataset anchor) in a single, importable Python configuration module.
- src/claims/intake_schema.py: Implements a machine-validated schema (e.g., JSON Schema as a Python dict) for claim card intake, encoding required fields and structural constraints.
- src/claims/intake_validator.py: Provides hard-fail validation functions that reject claim cards missing required claim text or dataset anchor and emits clear error messages.
- src/claims/templates.py: Contains example compliant vs non-compliant primary-source verification templates as structured strings/data for reuse in docs and tests.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Unit tests asserting the validator hard-fails when claim text or dataset anchor is missing and passes when both are present and well-formed.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_intake_validator_required_fields.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_intake_validator_required_fields.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_intake_validator_required_fields.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
