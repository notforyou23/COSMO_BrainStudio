You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create /outputs/catalog/ with METADATA_SCHEMA.json (or JSON Schema), plus a small add_case_study.py CLI that writes a new /outputs/case_studies/<slug>/case_study.json and updates an index file (e.g., /outputs/case_studies/index.json).
Project: /outputs/catalog/ with METADATA_SCHEMA.json (or JSON Schema), plus a small add_case_study.py CLI that writes a new /outputs/case_studies/<slug>/case_study.json and updates an index file (e.g., /outputs/case_studies/index.json). (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: src/catalog/paths.py
- Purpose: Centralizes filesystem path resolution for outputs/catalog and outputs/case_studies to keep CLI behavior consistent across environments.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/catalog/README.md: Documents the catalog directory purpose, required files, and how the case study schema and CLI are used to create and index case studies.
- outputs/catalog/METADATA_SCHEMA.json: Defines a JSON Schema for catalog metadata and case study records to enable consistent validation and tooling interoperability.
- src/cli/add_case_study.py: Implements a Python CLI that creates outputs/case_studies/<slug>/case_study.json from inputs, validates it against the schema, and updates outputs/case_studies/index.json atomically.
- src/catalog/schema.py: Provides schema loading and JSON validation helpers used by the CLI to validate case study documents against METADATA_SCHEMA.json.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Centralizes filesystem path resolution for outputs/catalog and outputs/case_studies to keep CLI behavior consistent across environments.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/catalog/paths.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/catalog/paths.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/catalog/paths.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
