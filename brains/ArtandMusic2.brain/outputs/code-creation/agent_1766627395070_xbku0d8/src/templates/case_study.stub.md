# Case Study Narrative

This narrative is paired with the case-study metadata JSON file in the same directory (e.g., `case_study.json`). Keep narrative claims consistent with the metadata, especially: dates, locations, actors/organizations, rights/licensing, and authoritative URLs.

## 1) Summary (What happened and why it matters)

Write a concise overview of the case study in plain language:
- context and setting
- main events or decisions
- outcomes/impacts
- who was affected and how
- what a reader should remember

## 2) Background and context

Describe the relevant historical, legal, economic, technical, or organizational context needed to interpret the case study. Prefer stable, authoritative sources (standards bodies, government publications, academic venues, official documentation).

## 3) Methods (How information was gathered and assessed)

Explain how the case study was constructed and how evidence was evaluated:
- sources consulted (primary vs. secondary)
- selection criteria and scope boundaries
- verification steps (triangulation, cross-checking, versioning)
- limitations, uncertainty, and potential bias
- whether any derived analysis was performed (and at what level of confidence)

If analysis involves tools or models, note inputs, assumptions, and reproducibility details without embedding secrets or private data.

## 4) Timeline (Key dates and milestones)

Provide a short chronological list of the most important events. Use ISO-8601 dates where possible (YYYY-MM-DD).

## 5) Stakeholders and roles

Summarize key parties and their roles (organizations, communities, regulators, vendors, researchers, etc.). Keep identifiers aligned with what appears in the metadata.

## 6) Findings and discussion

Present the main findings with careful attribution:
- what is directly supported by sources
- what is inference or interpretation
- alternative explanations considered
- implications for policy, engineering, operations, safety, or ethics

## 7) Rights, licensing, and attribution notes

This narrative should be compatible with the metadata’s rights and licensing fields:
- confirm the license under which this narrative is provided (see metadata)
- note any third-party material and its applicable terms
- include required attributions
- avoid copying non-permitted content; summarize and cite instead

## 8) Authoritative URLs (No downloads)

List stable, authoritative web references that support key claims. Do not download content; provide links only. Prefer:
- official reports, standards, regulatory filings
- peer-reviewed articles (publisher or DOI landing page)
- official incident advisories or vendor bulletins

## 9) Sources (Bibliography)

Provide a bibliography with enough detail to locate the sources:
- title, author/organization, year
- publication venue
- URL/DOI (preferred) and access date where relevant

Use a consistent format (e.g., APA, Chicago, IEEE) and keep URLs stable when possible.
