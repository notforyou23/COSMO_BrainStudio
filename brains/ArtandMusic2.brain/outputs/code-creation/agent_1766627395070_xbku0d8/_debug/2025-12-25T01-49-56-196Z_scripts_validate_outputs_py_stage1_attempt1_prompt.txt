Mission summary: Add a post-run artifact checklist to the single QA runner and CI (verify file existence + minimal non-empty checks), and store a normalized run manifest listing produced artifacts and their paths.
Project: generated_script_1766627395214 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/validate_outputs.py
- Purpose: Validates the normalized run manifest and artifact checklist results for CI consumption, failing fast on missing/empty artifacts or malformed manifest.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/qa_artifacts.py: Defines the post-run artifact checklist, normalization utilities, and manifest schema/IO used by the QA runner and CI to verify and record produced artifacts.
- scripts/qa_run.py: Single deterministic QA entrypoint that generates required scaffold, runs checks, verifies post-run artifacts (existence + minimal non-empty), and writes a normalized run manifest listing artifacts and paths.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: CI workflow that runs the single QA runner, then validates the produced run manifest and artifact checklist outcomes as a post-run gate.
- scripts/qa/README.md: Documents how to run the QA harness locally and in CI, what artifacts are expected, and the format/location of the normalized run manifest.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Validates the normalized run manifest and artifact checklist results for CI consumption, failing fast on missing/empty artifacts or malformed manifest.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/validate_outputs.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/validate_outputs.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/validate_outputs.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
