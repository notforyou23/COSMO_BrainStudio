You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create runtime/outputs/plan_project_scope_and_outline.md and ensure it deterministically maps to runtime/outputs/REPORT_OUTLINE.md and the section skeleton inside runtime/outputs/DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md.
Project: runtime/outputs/plan_project_scope_and_outline.md and ensure it deterministically maps to runtime/outputs/REPORT_OUTLINE.md and the section skeleton inside runtime/outputs/DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/plan_project_scope_and_outline.py
- Purpose: Deterministic generator that creates runtime/outputs/plan_project_scope_and_outline.md and ensures it maps exactly to runtime/outputs/REPORT_OUTLINE.md and the section skeleton in runtime/outputs/DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/outline_schema.py: Defines the canonical outline data model, deterministic section ID generation, and rendering functions used to produce all three markdown outputs consistently.
- src/md_render.py: Markdown rendering helpers that format headings, tables, checklists, and anchored section skeletons in a stable, deterministic way.
- src/io_utils.py: File I/O utilities for atomic writes, directory creation, newline normalization, and deterministic content hashing to verify mapping.
- src/cli.py: Command-line entrypoint that runs the generator with fixed defaults, validates deterministic mappings, and writes all required output files.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Deterministic generator that creates runtime/outputs/plan_project_scope_and_outline.md and ensures it maps exactly to runtime/outputs/REPORT_OUTLINE.md and the section skeleton in runtime/outputs/DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/plan_project_scope_and_outline.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/plan_project_scope_and_outline.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/plan_project_scope_and_outline.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
