You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create /outputs plus initial artifacts: REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md, METADATA_SCHEMA.md (or META.md), and a starter CASE_STUDIES_INDEX.csv to serve as the single intake table for exemplars.
Project: /outputs plus initial artifacts: REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md, METADATA_SCHEMA.md (or META.md), and a starter CASE_STUDIES_INDEX.csv to serve as the single intake table for exemplars. (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: src/templates.py
- Purpose: Holds the full default template contents for each initial artifact and provides helpers to render and validate them before writing to disk.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/init_outputs.py: CLI-capable Python module that creates the outputs directory and writes initial artifact files (REPORT_OUTLINE.md, CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md, METADATA_SCHEMA.md, CASE_STUDIES_INDEX.csv) in an idempotent, safe manner.
- src/csv_utils.py: Provides robust CSV read/write utilities to create and validate the starter CASE_STUDIES_INDEX.csv intake table with required columns and proper quoting.
- src/path_utils.py: Provides path resolution and filesystem safety utilities to ensure all writes stay under the project root and support dry-run behavior.
- pyproject.toml: Defines the package metadata and an executable entry point for running the initializer as a command.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Holds the full default template contents for each initial artifact and provides helpers to render and validate them before writing to disk.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/templates.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/templates.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/templates.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
