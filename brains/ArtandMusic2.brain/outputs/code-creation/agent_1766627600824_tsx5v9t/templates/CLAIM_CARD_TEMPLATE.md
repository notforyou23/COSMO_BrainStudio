# Claim Card

## Metadata
- **Claim Card ID:** CC-YYYY-NNN (unique, stable)
- **Created (YYYY-MM-DD):**
- **Author/Owner:**
- **Related Case Study IDs (if any):** (e.g., CS-2025-001)
- **Tags:** (optional)

## Claim Text (required)
Provide a single, testable statement. If multiple assertions exist, split into separate claim cards.
- **Claim:** 

## Scope (required)
Define *exactly* what the claim covers and what it does not.
- **Population / unit of analysis:** 
- **Geography:** 
- **Time period:** 
- **Operational definitions (key terms & measures):** 
- **Boundary conditions / exclusions:** 

## Evidence Type (required)
Select one primary type (and optionally list secondary types). If using a mix, prefer the strongest design as primary.
- **Primary evidence type (choose one):**
  - Experimental (RCT / field experiment)
  - Quasi-experimental (DiD, IV, RD, matching, natural experiment)
  - Observational (cross-sectional / longitudinal)
  - Meta-analysis / systematic review
  - Mechanistic / theoretical
  - Qualitative (interviews, ethnography, case comparison)
  - Descriptive / measurement report
  - Simulation / modeling
  - Expert consensus / position statement
  - Other (specify):
- **Secondary evidence types (optional):**

## Evidence Summary (required)
Summarize the evidence *as it bears on the claim*.
- **Key finding(s):**
- **How the evidence supports/limits the claim:**
- **Effect size / magnitude (if applicable):**
- **Uncertainty (CIs, robustness checks, sensitivity):**
- **Replicability notes (replications, re-analyses, preregistration):**

## Citations / DOIs / URLs (required)
List all sources needed to evaluate the claim. Prefer archival identifiers.
- **Citations (APA/MLA/etc.):**
- **DOIs:** 
- **URLs:** 
- **Access date(s) (YYYY-MM-DD):** 

## Verification Status (required)
Choose one status and justify it. Status must reflect the *claim as scoped*.
- **Status (choose one):** unverified | partially_verified | verified
- **Rationale (why this status is appropriate):**

## Abstention Triggers (required)
Specify conditions under which the system should refuse to assert this claim (or downgrade confidence).
Check all that apply and add any others.
- [ ] Missing primary source(s) or only secondary reporting available
- [ ] Key terms/measures not operationally defined (scope ambiguity)
- [ ] Evidence does not match scope (population/time/geography mismatch)
- [ ] Evidence is methodologically weak for causal wording (confounding risk)
- [ ] Statistical uncertainty too large / underpowered / non-robust
- [ ] Known retractions, unresolved disputes, or credible fraud concerns
- [ ] Paywalled/opaque data or methods prevent verification
- [ ] Conflicts of interest likely to bias results without independent corroboration
- [ ] Claim depends on proprietary or non-reproducible model outputs
- [ ] Other (specify):

## Notes (optional)
- **Potential follow-up checks / tests:**
- **Related claims (supporting or competing):**
