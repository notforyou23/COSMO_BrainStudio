You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add /outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json (or .csv) with fields for goal IDs, artifact paths, timestamps, status, and QA result; add a tiny script or documented manual update procedure and update it for the current cycle’s artifacts.
Project: generated_script_1766614313396 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: docs/PROJECT_TRACKER.md
- Purpose: Documented manual update procedure and examples for maintaining outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json during each cycle.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json: Machine-readable tracker capturing goal IDs, artifact paths, timestamps, status, and QA results for the current cycle’s artifacts.
- scripts/update_project_tracker.py: Tiny CLI script to create/update outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json by upserting entries from arguments or a simple JSON input and stamping timestamps.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Documented manual update procedure and examples for maintaining outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json during each cycle.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('docs/PROJECT_TRACKER.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:docs/PROJECT_TRACKER.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside docs/PROJECT_TRACKER.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
