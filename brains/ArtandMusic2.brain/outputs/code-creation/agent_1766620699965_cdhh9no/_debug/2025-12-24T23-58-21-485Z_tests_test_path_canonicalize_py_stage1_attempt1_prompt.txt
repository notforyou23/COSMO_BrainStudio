You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a canonical-path enforcement + migration step: ensure that artifacts currently generated under runtime/outputs/ (e.g., generated reports, schemas, tools) are copied/synced into the canonical /outputs/ tree, and update references accordingly. Emit a /outputs/qa/path_canonicalization_report.md listing what moved and what remains duplicated.
Project: canonical-path enforcement + migration step: ensure that artifacts currently generated under runtime/outputs/ (e.g., generated reports, schemas, (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_path_canonicalize.py
- Purpose: End-to-end tests using temporary directories to validate syncing from runtime/outputs to outputs, duplicate handling, optional reference rewriting, and correct markdown report emission.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/cli/path_canonicalize.py: Implements a Python CLI command that scans runtime/outputs/, syncs artifacts into the canonical outputs/ tree, optionally rewrites in-repo references, and emits outputs/qa/path_canonicalization_report.md summarizing moves, duplicates, and actions taken.
- src/cli/__init__.py: Defines the cli package entry points and exports the path canonicalization command for integration with the existing CLI tool.
- src/cli/_path_canonicalize_lib.py: Provides reusable library functions for file discovery, copy/sync logic, hashing/duplicate detection, reference rewriting, and markdown report generation used by the CLI command.
- tests/test_path_canonicalize_rewrite.py: Focused tests covering safe reference rewriting behavior (e.g., runtime/outputs to outputs) with allow/deny patterns and dry-run mode.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: End-to-end tests using temporary directories to validate syncing from runtime/outputs to outputs, duplicate handling, optional reference rewriting, and correct markdown report emission.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_path_canonicalize.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_path_canonicalize.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_path_canonicalize.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
