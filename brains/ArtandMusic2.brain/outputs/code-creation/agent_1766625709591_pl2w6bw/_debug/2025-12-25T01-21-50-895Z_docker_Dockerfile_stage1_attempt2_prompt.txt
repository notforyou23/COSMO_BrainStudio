You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add container-health instrumentation and a reproducible minimal failing case: run a single-file smoke test with full stdout/stderr capture; log runtime environment + resource stats; implement retries/backoff and a hard escalation rule when execution artifacts are missing.
Project: generated_script_1766625709797 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: docker/Dockerfile
- Purpose: Dockerfile for a minimal, reproducible execution environment that runs the smoke test and produces captured logs and artifacts for debugging container health issues.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/container_health_smoketest.py: Single-file smoke test runner that captures full stdout/stderr, logs runtime environment and resource stats, implements retries with backoff, and enforces hard escalation when expected execution artifacts are missing.
- scripts/minimal_failing_case.py: Reproducible minimal failing case script that can deterministically simulate common failure modes (nonzero exit, timeout, missing artifacts) to validate instrumentation and escalation behavior.
- scripts/artifact_expectations.json: Declarative list of required output artifacts and validation rules used by the smoke test to decide success versus hard escalation when files are missing.
- docker/docker-compose.yml: Docker Compose configuration to run the smoke test in a controlled container with configurable resource limits, volumes for artifacts, and environment overrides.

Key requirements:
- docker

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Dockerfile for a minimal, reproducible execution environment that runs the smoke test and produces captured logs and artifacts for debugging container health issues.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('docker/Dockerfile')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:docker/Dockerfile')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside docker/Dockerfile.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
