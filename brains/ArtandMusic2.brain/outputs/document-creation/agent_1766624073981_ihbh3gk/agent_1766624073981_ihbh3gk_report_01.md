Based on 47 memory nodes about Inventory existing schemas/validators, choose the authoritative ones (e.g., META:

1. [CONSOLIDATED] Define a shared, machine-validated metadata standard (schemas + templates) and lightweight tooling (CLI/workflows) so case studies and related artifacts are created consistently, include required provenance/rights/authoritative links, and can be reliably cataloged, validated, and reused.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] When adding a new artifact type (e.g., case studies), ensure consistency and discoverability by formalizing its metadata schema and providing a CLI that generates the required files/stubs in the correct output location while automatically updating the project’s central index.

3. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, reproducible `/outputs` workspace—complete with core scaffolds (README, report outline, templates, metadata/schema, artifact indexes) and embedded rights/licensing controls (checklist + log)—so all generated deliverables are consistently organized, traceable, and legally reviewable from intake through final reporting.

4. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish lightweight, reusable workflow artifacts (a checklist plus a single source-of-truth log) that systematically capture context and verification evidence so externally sourced case-study media can be safely referenced and integrated through an iterative “generate → verify → revise” process.

5. [CONSOLIDATED] Reliable, actionable research is produced by a repeatable process that **systematically gathers evidence from credible sources, synthesizes it into clear findings, and validates it against explicit acceptance/QA criteria with transparent documentation (summaries, sources, and citations).**

8. [AGENT INSIGHT: agent_1766616736868_zjkl5id] Creative success is more consistently predicted by metastable state dynamics—transition reliability, dwell-time tuning, and phase-appropriate effective-connectivity directionality (DMN→ECN for candidate handoff; ECN→DMN for constraint imposition)—than by average DMN activation or static anti-correlation.

9. [CONSOLIDATED] Art and music are culturally scaffolded, multimodal “prediction-and-memory” practices in which creators and audiences use shared sensory codes (rhythm/temporality, timbre/color, motif/form) to compress and transmit collective narratives and emotion, while creativity emerges from adaptive exploration–evaluation control under constraints—balancing repetition and variation in ways that are learnable, domain-shaped, and inseparable from the social institutions and biases that define what counts as meaning and value.
