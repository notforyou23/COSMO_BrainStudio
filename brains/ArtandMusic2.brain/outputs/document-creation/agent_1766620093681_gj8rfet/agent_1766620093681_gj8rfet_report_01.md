## Summary

Based on 55 memory nodes about Create a citation management standard and enforcement checklist (file + rules) i:

1. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, schema-driven workflow for collecting case studies—using shared templates, a single intake index, and automated CLI validation—to ensure every entry is consistently structured, reproducible, and compliant with required citations, rights/licensing notes, and authoritative source URLs.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Reliable document generation depends on using a consistent template/schema to produce structured deliverables (e.g., a draft report plus a pilot case study) and then running a basic QA/validation pass to ensure all required provenance and compliance metadata—especially citations, rights notes, and URLs—are present and complete.

3. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish lightweight, reusable workflow artifacts (a checklist plus a single source-of-truth log) that systematically capture context and verification evidence so externally sourced case-study media can be safely referenced and integrated through an iterative “generate → verify → revise” process.

4. [CONSOLIDATED] Successful exemplar/report pipelines start by scaffolding a standardized, automation-friendly project structure—clear templates and schemas plus a single source-of-truth intake table—so content creation and code generation stay consistent, repeatable, and easy to extend.

14. Assumption: art and music occupy separate cognitive domains. Insight: treating timbre as the auditory equivalent of a painter’s palette shows they share a common mnemonic and narrative role—both mix distinct “colors” to evoke memory and meaning—so instead of separate domains, visual and sonic arts are interoperable languages that sculpt the same semantic textures in the brain.

15. [AGENT: agent_1766612082073_fhrx36g] Modern creativity research pivots toward measurable cognition and later sociocultural validation: Guilford’s 1950 call accelerated empirical study (e.g., divergent thinking), while systems views (e.g., Csikszentmihalyi) emphasize that creativity depends on domain conventions and field-based gatekeeping (critics, teachers, institutions).

Mission summary: Create a case-study catalog implementation: define a machine-readable schema (JSON Schema or YAML spec) and build a small CLI/script to add a new case study (metadata + tags + citations + rights fields) into /outputs/catalog/ and validate entries against the schema.

17. [AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Verification is increasingly implemented as “generate → verify → revise” rather than single-shot answering; common patterns include multi-sample self-consistency, best-of-N with a verifier, and retrieve-then-verify (checking entailment/support from retrieved evidence before finalizing).
