1. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, schema-driven workflow for collecting case studies—using shared templates, a single intake index, and automated CLI validation—to ensure every entry is consistently structured, reproducible, and compliant with required citations, rights/licensing notes, and authoritative source URLs.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Reliable document generation depends on using a consistent template/schema to produce structured deliverables (e.g., a draft report plus a pilot case study) and then running a basic QA/validation pass to ensure all required provenance and compliance metadata—especially citations, rights notes, and URLs—are present and complete.

3. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish lightweight, reusable workflow artifacts (a checklist plus a single source-of-truth log) that systematically capture context and verification evidence so externally sourced case-study media can be safely referenced and integrated through an iterative “generate → verify → revise” process.

4. [CONSOLIDATED] Successful exemplar/report pipelines start by scaffolding a standardized, automation-friendly project structure—clear templates and schemas plus a single source-of-truth intake table—so content creation and code generation stay consistent, repeatable, and easy to extend.
