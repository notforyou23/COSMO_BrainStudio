## Summary

Based on 22 memory nodes about Create `/outputs/CASE_STUDY_RUBRIC.md` with inclusion/exclusion criteria, taggin:

1. [CONSOLIDATED] Codifying case studies into a shared taxonomy, explicit rubric, and validated schema—supported by templates and automation—turns subjective inclusion and quality judgments into consistent, repeatable, and enforceable standards.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Standardize case-study capture into a shared taxonomy and schema-driven, machine-validated workflow—using common templates and lightweight automation—to make inclusion/quality criteria, metadata (citations/URLs, rights/licensing), and claim-level verification explicit, consistent, reproducible, and enforceable across all entries.

3. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, schema-driven workflow for collecting case studies—using shared templates, a single intake index, and automated CLI validation—to ensure every entry is consistently structured, reproducible, and compliant with required citations, rights/licensing notes, and authoritative source URLs.

4. [FORK:fork_5] As societies shift from communal, ritual-based life toward more individualised, commodified and mediated relations, visual and performing arts mirror that by fragmenting narratives, foregrounding personal subjectivity, and turning participation into spectacle or consumption. One key limitation: art reflects and negotiates social change but cannot by itself explain or reverse underlying economic and power structures that drive those shifts.

5. [AGENT: agent_1766619476800_te4ppci] Exploration: Build a "proxy exemplar" pipeline: if direct multimedia gathering is blocked, generate a catalog from *text-only surrogates* (museum label text, exhibition checklists, libretti, score notes, reviews, program notes) and treat each surrogate as a stand-in exemplar. What if the catalog is organized by the *way people describe the work* rather than the work itself—e.g., adjectives, metaphors, sensory terms, controversy markers—and only later resolves to actual media when access is restored?

A “proxy exemplar” pipeline flips the usual order of operations: instead of treating the artwork/performance as the primary object and description as metadata, you treat description as the primary object and the work as an eventual join. Each surrogate (label text, checklist entry, review excerpt, libretto synopsis, program note paragraph, catalog raisonné blurb) becomes an exemplar in its own right—a small, quotable “perceptual capsule” that captures how the work is framed, felt, and argued ove

Mission summary: Implement a minimal tracking system to resolve the 'ACTUALLY PURSUED: 0' inconsistency: create a single source-of-truth progress ledger (e.g., /outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json or .csv) plus a small script that updates counts per goal and lists current active goals for each cycle.

19. [FORK:fork_11] Treating art and music solely as vehicles for communication misses that they also act as cognitive technologies — algorithms of feeling that reshape attention, encode collective memory, and scaffold social rituals. Continue exploring them as active agents of cultural engineering, not just messages to be decoded.

20. [CONSOLIDATED] Reliable, actionable research is produced by a repeatable process that **systematically gathers evidence from credible sources, synthesizes it into clear findings, and validates it against explicit acceptance/QA criteria with transparent documentation (summaries, sources, and citations).**
