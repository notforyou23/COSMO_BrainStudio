Actionable consequence: reanalyze existing datasets using event-aligned models keyed to inflection points (edits, corrections, tempo breaks) and metastable-state transitions; prediction: previously “weak” DMN–ECN findings will sharpen when aligned to behavior-defined state changes rather than task epochs.

## Summary

Based on 57 memory nodes about Produce a concrete '12 case studies list' artifact in /outputs (e.g., /outputs/C:

1. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, schema-driven workflow for collecting case studies—using shared templates, a single intake index, and automated CLI validation—to ensure every entry is consistently structured, reproducible, and compliant with required citations, rights/licensing notes, and authoritative source URLs.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Treat report/case-study creation as a **schema-driven, automation-friendly pipeline** where standardized templates and a single source-of-truth intake log produce consistent artifacts, and a lightweight QA gate (validators + checklists) enforces required provenance metadata—especially citations, URLs, and rights/licensing—so outputs are reproducible, auditable, and safe to publish.

3. [CONSOLIDATED] Reliable document generation depends on using a consistent template/schema to produce structured deliverables (e.g., a draft report plus a pilot case study) and then running a basic QA/validation pass to ensure all required provenance and compliance metadata—especially citations, rights notes, and URLs—are present and complete.

4. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish lightweight, reusable workflow artifacts (a checklist plus a single source-of-truth log) that systematically capture context and verification evidence so externally sourced case-study media can be safely referenced and integrated through an iterative “generate → verify → revise” process.
