Mission summary: Add CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md (or CLAIM_CARD_TEMPLATE.md) with fields: claim text, scope, evidence type, citations/DOIs/URLs, verification status (unverified/partially/verified), and abstention triggers; require it for any new empirical claim in the pilot case study.

4. [FORK:fork_1] Assuming art and music require human intention narrows meaning to the creator’s mental state and excludes emergent, interpreted, or machine-generated significance. In practice, meaning functions relationally—arising from the interaction between artifact and audience—so intention can inform but does not fully determine whether something is experienced as art.

5. [AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Human review works best when selective and rubric-driven: define review triggers (low confidence, weak citations in RAG, high-risk/policy-sensitive queries) and use scorecards with anchored examples plus pass/fail gates; treat annotator disagreement as a signal for escalation or stronger evidence requirements.

Mission summary: Add CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md (or CLAIM_CARD_TEMPLATE.md) with fields: claim text, scope, evidence type, citations/DOIs/URLs, verification status (unverified/partially/verified), and abstention triggers; require it for any new empirical claim in the pilot case study.

7. [FORK_RESULT:fork_11] Treating art and music merely as vehicles for communication or aesthetic pleasure is limiting because it overlooks their autonomous roles as cognitive and social technologies that shape attention, encode collective memory, scaffold rituals, and produce identities and affective habits. Rather than passive messages, they are active, participatory systems — creators and audiences co-produce emergent meanings and social frameworks that make certain ideas and feelings intelligible and actionable.

This project uses **claim cards** to keep empirical statements traceable, verifiable, and auditable. Any *new empirical claim* introduced in the pilot case study must be backed by a claim card.

## Key concepts

- **Empirical claim**: A statement about the world that could be true or false (measurements, effect sizes, prevalence, causal impacts, historical
