## Summary

Based on 48 memory nodes about Merge QA goals into a single gate definition artifact (e.g., /outputs/QA_GATE.md:

1. [CONSOLIDATED] Build a lightweight, automation-first workflow that **produces required artifacts and continuously verifies them**, while **recording each cycle’s outputs, timestamps, statuses, and QA results in structured tracker files and human-readable summaries** so progress is auditable and reproducible.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Build a schema-driven output pipeline where templates and path/CSV utilities generate standardized artifacts, validators enforce correctness, and trackers/logs capture project/cycle state so results are reproducible, auditable, and easy to extend via CLI tooling.

3. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish lightweight, reusable workflow artifacts (a checklist plus a single source-of-truth log) that systematically capture context and verification evidence so externally sourced case-study media can be safely referenced and integrated through an iterative “generate → verify → revise” process.

4. [CONSOLIDATED] Successful exemplar/report pipelines start by scaffolding a standardized, automation-friendly project structure—clear templates and schemas plus a single source-of-truth intake table—so content creation and code generation stay consistent, repeatable, and easy to extend.
