## Summary

Based on 31 memory nodes about Implement a 'no-container/failsafe' mode in the runner: detect container failure:

1. [INTROSPECTION] 2025-12-25T00-50-00-140Z_outputs_qa_RUN_INSTRUCTIONS_md_stage1_attempt1_prompt.txt from code-creation agent agent_1766623798549_61a97nt: You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a focused remediation patch that adds a 'no-container/failsafe execution mode' to the QA runner scripts (e.g., graceful degradation, reduced test set, clear error capture) so that execution does not terminate with 'container lost' without producing logs and partial results; document

2. [INTROSPECTION] 2025-12-25T00-50-00-140Z_scripts_qa_detect_py_stage1_attempt1_prompt.txt from code-creation agent agent_1766623798549_61a97nt: You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add container-health instrumentation and a reproducible minimal failing case: run a single-file smoke test with full stdout/stderr capture; log runtime environment + resource stats; implement retries/backoff and a hard escalation rule when execution artifacts are missing.
