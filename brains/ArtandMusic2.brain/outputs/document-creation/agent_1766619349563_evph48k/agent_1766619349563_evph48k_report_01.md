## Minimal update script (Makefile target)

### Makefile target: `tracker-touch`
This is deliberately minimal: it “updates” the tracker deterministically by ensuring the canonical file exists at the agreed authoritative path.

Create (or edit) a `Makefile` with:

```makefile
tracker-touch:
	@mkdir -p outputs
	@test -f outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json || ( \
		echo 'Creating outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json (canonical tracker)'; \
		cat > outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json <<'JSON' ; \
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "title": "PROJECT_TRACKER: single source-of-truth progress ledger",
  "purpose": "Eliminate cross-cycle inconsistencies (e.g., \u201cACTUALLY PURSUED: 0\u201d) by recording goal definitions and per-cycle activity in one deterministic ledger file that all agents/tools read and update.",
  "authoritative_file": "outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json",
  "optional_exports": [
    "outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.csv"
  ],
  "project": "sin",
  "records": {
    "goals": [],
    "cycles": []
  },
  "notes": [
    "Tracker reads/writes this file only (authoritative).",
    "CSV is optional and may be generated as a convenience export."
  ]
}
JSON \
	)
	@echo 'OK: outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json present'
```

This matches the stated design from the referenced `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` introspection: the tracker’s authoritative store is `outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json`, and `outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.csv` is optional.

## Canonical tracking source (single source-of-truth)

Effective immediately, `outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json` is the *canonical* (authoritative) progress ledger for this repository.

This is based on the established tracker design captured in `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` (introspection from code-creation agent `agent_1766616245398_0s5lm4w`):

- Purpose: **eliminate cross-cycle inconsistencies** (explicit example: “ACTUALLY PURSUED: 0”) by recording goal definitions and per-cycle activity in **one deterministic ledger file** that **all agents/tools read and update**.
- Files:
  - `outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json` (**authoritative**): tracker reads/writes this file only.
  - `outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.csv` (**optional** export).

Project context recorded by the implementing agent prompts: `Project: sin` (see introspection prompts dated `2025-12-24T22-44-06-833Z`).

## Reconciliation rule: how conflicts are resolved

If any other portfolio/status documents, dashboards, or cycle summaries contain fields that conflict with tracking (including but not limited to “ACTUALLY PURSUED”), the value in `outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json` wins.

Concretely:

1. **Do not** compute “ACTUALLY PURSUED” (or equivalent pursued/active counts) by scanning narrative documents.
2. **Do** compute those counts from `outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json` only, because it is the deterministic ledger designed to prevent the “ACTUALLY PURSUED: 0” failure mode.

## Required updates to conflicting portfolio fields

Wherever a portfolio/status artifact currently derives or displays pursued/active goal counts, it must be updated to:

- Read from `outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json` (canonical), and
- Treat `outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.csv` as a non-authoritative convenience export only (if present).

This explicitly removes cross-cycle ambiguity and ensures that all tools/agents share the same ground truth.

## Operational note (how the canonical file is maintained)

A minimal maintenance command is provided as a Makefile target:

- `make tracker-touch`

This ensures the canonical file exists at `outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json` and is therefore available for tools/agents to read and update.

## Conclusion

`outputs/PROJECT_TRACKER.json` is the single source-of-truth for goal definitions and per-cycle activity, created specifically to prevent inconsistencies like “ACTUALLY PURSUED: 0”. All conflicting portfolio/status fields must be reconciled by deferring to this file, with CSV treated only as an optional export.
