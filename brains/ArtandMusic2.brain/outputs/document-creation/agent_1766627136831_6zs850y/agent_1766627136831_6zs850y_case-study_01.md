## Required QA Gate for Pilot Workflow (Claim Analysis Completion Criteria)

### Mission requirement (new hard gate)
In the pilot workflow, **no claim analysis is considered “complete” unless BOTH of the following are present under `/outputs/qa/` and they pass**:

1. **Schema validation report** (must show a passing result)
2. **`QA_REPORT.*` artifact(s)** (must be present and must show a passing result)

If either item is missing or failing, the claim analysis remains incomplete.

---

## Grounding in existing COSMO QA configuration (what we already know exists)

COSMO already has an explicit QA gating mechanism configured in `qa_gates.yaml` (from code-creation agent `agent_1766618407426_jbwdhcj`) with:

- `version: 1`
- `qa.fail_fast: true` (failure stops the process early)
- A defined artifact gate for `claim_card` including:
  - `template_path: outputs/templates/CLAIM_CARD.yaml`
  - `workflow_path: outputs/workflows/CLAIM_VERIFICATION_WORKFLOW.md`
  - `schema_path: config/claim_card.schema.yaml`
  - `artifact_globs` that define acceptable locations/formats for the Claim Card:
    - `outputs/**/CLAIM_CARD.yaml`
    - `outputs/**/CLAIM_CARD.yml`
    - `outputs/**/CLAIM_CARD.md`
  - `required_inputs: [v]`

This proves the system already treats QA as a **configurable, explicit gate** with:
- a schema (`config/claim_card.schema.yaml`) and
- known output artifact patterns (`outputs/**/CLAIM_CARD.*`),
and it is already set to **fail fast**.

The mission now adds an additional *completion criterion* specific to the pilot workflow: the QA artifacts must be located in `/outputs/qa/` and must pass.

---

## Definition of “complete” (updated acceptance criteria)

A pilot claim analysis is only complete when all of the following conditions are met:

### A) Claim Card exists (existing artifact expectations)
- A Claim Card artifact exists matching one of these patterns:
  - `outputs/**/CLAIM_CARD.yaml`
  - `outputs/**/CLAIM_CARD.yml`
  - `outputs/**/CLAIM_CARD.md`

### B) Sche

## Summary

Based on 75 memory nodes about Implement a QA report generator that emits /outputs/qa/QA_REPORT.json and /outpu:

1. [AGENT: agent_1766620093682_0dbi3wj] Document Created: single command (e.g., scripts/qa_run.sh or python -m qa.run) that (1) runs scaffold generation, (2) asserts expected paths exist, and (3) emits a timestamped pass/fail report to /outputs/qa/qa_run_<timestamp>.md/json.

# Single-command QA run: scaffold → path assertions → timestamped pass/fail report

This design follows the repeatedly stated mission variants in COSMO’s planning notes:

- The command must **run scaffold generation first**, then **assert required artifacts exist under `/outputs`**, and **fail QA/CI if outputs are elsewhere**. (Plans at `2025-12-24T22-59-19-146Z` and `2025-12-24T22-17-09-292Z`.)
- It must emit a **timestamped pass/fail report** to:  
  `/outputs/qa/qa_run_<timestamp>.md` and `/outputs/qa/qa_run_<timestamp>.json`. (User mission.)
- Required artifact sets appear in two explicit variants in the notes:
  1) `/outputs` must contain: `DRAFT_REPORT_v0.md`, `CASE_STUDY_RUBRIC.md`, `TRACKING_RECONCILIATION.md`, plus “any required index”. (Plans at `2025-12-24T22-59-19-146Z`.)  
  2) `/outputs` must contain: `REPORT_OUTLINE.md`, `CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md`, `METADATA_SCHEMA.json`, `WORKLOG.md`. (Plans at `2025-12-24T22-17-09-292Z`.)
- COSMO already documented a validator script concept at `outputs/tools/validate_outputs.py` that checks for `REPORT_OUTLINE.md`, `CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md`, `METADATA_SCHEMA.json`, `WORKLOG.md`, logs a summary, and exits nonzero on failure. (Memory item 7.)
