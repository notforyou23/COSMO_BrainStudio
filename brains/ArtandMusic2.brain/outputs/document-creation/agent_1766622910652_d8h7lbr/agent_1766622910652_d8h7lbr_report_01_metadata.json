The deliverable must require three mandatory fields (exact claim text verbatim, source/context with provenance link or screenshot metadata, and at least one provenance anchor such as dataset name/DOI/link or paper title/author), include template examples tailored to art & music use-cases, and clear validation rules that block downstream agents from starting work until all fields are populated.",
