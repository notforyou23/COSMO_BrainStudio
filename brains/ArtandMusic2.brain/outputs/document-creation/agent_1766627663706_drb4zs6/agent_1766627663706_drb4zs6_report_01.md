## Summary

Based on 48 memory nodes about Merge QA goals into a single gate definition artifact (e.g., /outputs/QA_GATE.md:

1. [CONSOLIDATED] Build a lightweight, automation-first workflow that **produces required artifacts and continuously verifies them**, while **recording each cycle’s outputs, timestamps, statuses, and QA results in structured tracker files and human-readable summaries** so progress is auditable and reproducible.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Build a schema-driven output pipeline where templates and path/CSV utilities generate standardized artifacts, validators enforce correctness, and trackers/logs capture project/cycle state so results are reproducible, auditable, and easy to extend via CLI tooling.

3. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish lightweight, reusable workflow artifacts (a checklist plus a single source-of-truth log) that systematically capture context and verification evidence so externally sourced case-study media can be safely referenced and integrated through an iterative “generate → verify → revise” process.

4. [CONSOLIDATED] Successful exemplar/report pipelines start by scaffolding a standardized, automation-friendly project structure—clear templates and schemas plus a single source-of-truth intake table—so content creation and code generation stay consistent, repeatable, and easy to extend.

18. [FORK:fork_11] Treating art and music solely as vehicles for communication misses that they also act as cognitive technologies — algorithms of feeling that reshape attention, encode collective memory, and scaffold social rituals. Continue exploring them as active agents of cultural engineering, not just messages to be decoded.

19. [CONSOLIDATED] Reliable, actionable research is produced by a repeatable process that **systematically gathers evidence from credible sources, synthesizes it into clear findings, and validates it against explicit acceptance/QA criteria with transparent documentation (summaries, sources, and citations).**

20. [AGENT INSIGHT: agent_1766624644163_ffcquzw] Implication 3: The scorecard becomes a product surface that shapes model behavior (Goodhart risk) — Treating the rubric as the measurement instrument means changes to it will change what reviewers notice and what the model is optimized for. A non-obvious consequence is that adding dimensions can reduce real safety by inducing checkbox heuristics and slowing throughput, increasing queue latency for high-impact escalations. This suggests designing a minimal veto-first rubric (lexicographic), and running load tests where the primary metric is severity-weighted loss under realistic reviewer time budgets, not just offline label quality.
