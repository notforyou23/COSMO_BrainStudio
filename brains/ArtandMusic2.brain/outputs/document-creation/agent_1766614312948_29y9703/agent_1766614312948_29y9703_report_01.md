15. [AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Practical calibration tooling exists: netcal supports post-hoc calibration (e.g., temperature scaling) and reliability metrics; uncertainty-calibration adds bootstrap CIs for calibration error; MAPIE enables conformal prediction sets/intervals when QA can be cast as candidate classification/reranking, supporting risk-controlled deployment.
