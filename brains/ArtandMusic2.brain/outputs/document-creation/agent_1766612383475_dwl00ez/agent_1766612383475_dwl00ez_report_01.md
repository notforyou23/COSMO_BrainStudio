Below are the complete, ready-to-save contents for two new workflow artifacts to place in `/outputs/`:

1) `RIGHTS_AND_LICENSING_CHECKLIST.md`  
2) `RIGHTS_LOG.csv` (template)

They are grounded only in the provided COSMO knowledge: the project’s deliverables include *case studies* (with “2–3 sentence justifications and preliminary source leads”) integrated into a final plan document (`runtime/outputs/plan_project_scope_and_outline.md`), and the process emphasizes structured inputs, context capture, and “generate → verify → revise” iteration. The checklist and log operationalize those needs specifically for permissions/rights tracking for *images/audio/video examples used in case studies*.

# Rights & Licensing Checklist (Case Study Media)

## Purpose and scope
This checklist governs how we select, document, and approve **images, audio, and video examples used in case studies** so that the final integrated project plan document (`runtime/outputs/plan_project_scope_and_outline.md`) can include media references with traceable permissions.

This workflow is designed to support:
- **Case study compilation** (Sub-goal sg_4): “exactly 12 candidates” with justifications and **preliminary source leads**.
- **Integration** (Sub-goal sg_6): cross-links between case studies and other project components.
- A verification mindset aligned to observed patterns: **“generate → verify → revise”** (agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw).

> Output artifacts created/maintained by this workflow:
- `/outputs/RIGHTS_LOG.csv` (the single source of truth for permissions)
- Any supporting evidence files (screenshots, emails, license texts) referenced by row in the log

---

## When to use this checklist
Use this checklist whenever a case study draft proposes an **image/audio/video example**, including:
- media to embed directly in case study writeups,
- thumbnails/stills for videos,
- audio clips,
- performance recordings,
- any externally hosted media we link and describe as an “example.”

This checklist is required before sg_6 (integration) finalizes the plan document narrative and cross-links.

---

## Roles (mapped to known agent types)
These responsibilities use the agent types already defined in the project plan (sg_1–sg_6):

- **Research agent (sg_4)**: proposes media examples and fills *source lead* details; creates initial log entries.
- **Project manager (sg_1 / sg_5)**: ensures every case study media item has a log row and an approval status; enforces schedule review checkpoints.
- **Editorial agent (sg_6)**: only integrates media references that have a completed rights record and an approval status.
- **QA / verifier** (pattern from acceptance QA work): checks completeness and context (who/when/where/what) before approval.

---

## Rights workflow overview (generate → verify → revise)
This workflow follows the same iterative verification pattern noted in QA research:
1) **Generate**: propose media example(s) for a case study.
2) **Verify**: capture minimum viable rights inputs + context; confirm permission terms are documented.
3) **Revise**: if rights are unclear, replace the media example, narrow to a safer reference, or secure explicit permission.

No media item moves to “Approved” without verification inputs recorded in the RIGHTS_LOG.

---

## Checklist: minimum viable inputs per media item
The goal is not “perfect legal analysis”; it is *traceable documentation* sufficient for downstream integration and auditing.

### A. Identify the media item (required)
- [ ] **Case Study ID/Name**: matches the case study list used in sg_4 (12 candidates, ranked 1–12).
- [ ] **Media type**: image / audio / video.
- [ ] **What it is**: title/caption/brief description (what the item depicts or contains).
- [ ] **Source lead**: URL or repository pointer (a “preliminary source lead” is explicitly required for case studies in sg_4).

### B. Capture rights context (required; aligned to QA “context/source required” finding)
To avoid dead-ends and to enable later correction tracking, record context as emphasized in fact-checking guidance:

- [ ] **Who**: creator/rights holder/organization as presented at the source.
- [ ] **When**: publication date or “as accessed” date for the rights statement.
- [ ] **Where**: the exact page/location where rights/license info is stated.
- [ ] **What**: the rights claim itself (quoted or summarized) and any restrictions.

This mirrors the acceptance QA finding that **context/source (“who said it, when, link/screenshot text”) is required** to track updates/corrections by date (agent_1766612249730_02kggt6 Finding 4).

### C. Record the permission basis (required)
For each media item, select and document *one* permission basis, and capture evidence:

- [ ] **License stated at source** (record license name + link/text)
- [ ] **Direct permission obtained** (record requester, recipient, date, and granted scope)
- [ ] **Owner/collection terms** (record institution/collection and the specific terms shown)

If you cannot fill this section from available information:
- [ ] Mark the item as **“Needs rights verification”** and do not integrate it into sg_6 outputs.

### D. Evidence attachment/trace (required)
- [ ] Store/attach an **evidence snippet** reference (e.g., screenshot text, copied license statement, or an email excerpt).
- [ ] Link the evidence reference in the log row (file path or stable pointer).

This implements the same “minimum viable inputs” thinking used elsewhere:
- Primary-source verification needed “claim text plus dataset name/link/DOI (or at least research area)” (agent_1766612249730_02kggt6 Finding 2).
For rights, the parallel is: **rights text + link + access date** (at minimum).

---

## Approval gates (what “Approved” means)
A media item can be marked **Approved** only if:
- [ ] All fields in Sections A–D are completed in `RIGHTS_LOG.csv`
- [ ] The rights context (who/when/where/what) is captured
- [ ] The permission basis is clear enough to state “Approved” with a recorded scope

If any are missing, status must remain:
- “Needs rights verification” **or**
- “Do not use / replace”

Editorial integration (sg_6) must treat non-approved items as out of scope.

---

## QA checklist for reviewers (fast pass)
Use this as a quick audit before sg_6 integration:

For each proposed case study media example:
- [ ] There is a matching row in `RIGHTS_LOG.csv`
- [ ] The row includes:
  - [ ] source lead (URL/location)
  - [ ] rights statement context (who/when/where/what)
  - [ ] evidence reference (screenshot/email/license text pointer)
  - [ ] an explicit status (Approved / Needs rights verification / Do not use)
- [ ] If status is not Approved, the media is not referenced/embedded in the integrated plan

---

## Integration rule (for `plan_project_scope_and_outline.md`)
When integrating case studies (sg_6):
- Only reference media items whose RIGHTS_LOG status is **Approved**.
- For each integrated media item, include a short media citation line that corresponds to the log row (e.g., “Media: [RIGHTS_LOG row id]”).

This enforces internal consistency similar to sg_6 success indicators (case studies map to eras/themes; schedule references defined outputs), but applied to permissions: *integrated media references must map to an Approved rights record*.

---

## Conclusion
This checklist converts the project’s established working practices—structured minimum inputs, context capture for verification, and a “generate → verify → revise” loop—into a concrete rights workflow for case study media. Maintaining `RIGHTS_LOG.csv` as the auditable source of truth ensures sg_4 case study sourcing remains usable during sg_6 integration, while preventing unverified images/audio/video from entering the final plan output.
