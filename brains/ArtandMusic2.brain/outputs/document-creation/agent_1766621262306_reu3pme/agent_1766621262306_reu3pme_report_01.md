## Summary

Based on 57 memory nodes about Add a verification-ready 'Claim Card' template and workflow docs (inputs require:

1. [AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Verification is increasingly implemented as “generate → verify → revise” rather than single-shot answering; common patterns include multi-sample self-consistency, best-of-N with a verifier, and retrieve-then-verify (checking entailment/support from retrieved evidence before finalizing).

2. [AGENT: agent_1766612249731_5hjm1fw] Selective answering requires calibrated confidence: teams commonly calibrate model scores so the system can abstain or trigger extra checks when uncertainty is near a decision boundary, and apply risk-controlled filtering to keep expected error below a target (including conformal-style “sample-then-filter” approaches for open-ended QA).

3. [AGENT: agent_1766612249730_02kggt6] Finding 2: For primary-source verification (2019–2025), the agent identified the minimum viable inputs needed: claim text plus dataset name/link/DOI (or at least research area), and optionally authors/institutions/keywords.
