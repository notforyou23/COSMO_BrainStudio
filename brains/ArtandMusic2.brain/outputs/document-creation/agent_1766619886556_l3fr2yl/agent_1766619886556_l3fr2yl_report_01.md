## Summary

Based on 57 memory nodes about Produce a concrete '12 case studies list' artifact in /outputs (e.g., /outputs/C:

1. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, schema-driven workflow for collecting case studies—using shared templates, a single intake index, and automated CLI validation—to ensure every entry is consistently structured, reproducible, and compliant with required citations, rights/licensing notes, and authoritative source URLs.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Treat report/case-study creation as a **schema-driven, automation-friendly pipeline** where standardized templates and a single source-of-truth intake log produce consistent artifacts, and a lightweight QA gate (validators + checklists) enforces required provenance metadata—especially citations, URLs, and rights/licensing—so outputs are reproducible, auditable, and safe to publish.

3. [CONSOLIDATED] Reliable document generation depends on using a consistent template/schema to produce structured deliverables (e.g., a draft report plus a pilot case study) and then running a basic QA/validation pass to ensure all required provenance and compliance metadata—especially citations, rights notes, and URLs—are present and complete.

4. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish lightweight, reusable workflow artifacts (a checklist plus a single source-of-truth log) that systematically capture context and verification evidence so externally sourced case-study media can be safely referenced and integrated through an iterative “generate → verify → revise” process.

5. [AGENT: agent_1766612082095_ysd3xim] Exploration: Counter-archive as artwork: Build the exemplar catalog as a "rogue museum labeler" that treats metadata itself (title/creator/date/medium/license/timestamps) as the primary medium. What if the licensing status and excerpt timestamps are curated like brushstrokes—e.g., juxtapose public-domain images with tightly licensed video clips to reveal how access shapes cultural memory? Concretely: pick one theme (labor, surveillance, migration, ritual, ecology) and assemble exemplars where the *rights regime* is the hidden narrative; include at least one work whose meaning changes when only short excerpts are permissible, and highlight that tension in the record.

Treat the catalog like a rogue wall text that has decided the *real* exhibit is the permissions layer. I’ll pick **ecology** as the theme, because environmental “commons” imagery (satellite views, classic prints of waves and weather) is often *literally* public domain—while the most emotionally persuasive ecological cinema is typically paywalled, DRM’d, and excerpt-hostile. In this counter-archive, **title/creator/date** are the visible brushstrokes, but **license + excerptability** is the hidde

6. [CONSOLIDATED] Reliable, actionable research is produced by a repeatable process that **systematically gathers evidence from credible sources, synthesizes it into clear findings, and validates it against explicit acceptance/QA criteria with transparent documentation (summaries, sources, and citations).**
