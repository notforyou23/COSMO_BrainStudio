## Summary

Based on 43 memory nodes about Encode these minimum inputs into the intake checklist validation rules (goal_9) :

1. [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a canonical, machine-verifiable “gate” of required artifacts and fields (paths, templates, schemas, citations/provenance, rights, and reports) so every intake and output is standardized, complete, and reproducible before downstream analysis proceeds.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Establishing a repeatable documentation pipeline requires a canonical output scaffold (reports, case studies, schemas, rights, tracking), standardized templates/metadata schemas, and an automated single-command QA gate that validates required fields (citations/URLs/rights), path completeness, and schema conformance while emitting timestamped pass/fail reports.

3. [CONSOLIDATED] Reliable, publish-safe knowledge artifacts come from treating research and document generation as a schema-driven pipeline—using standardized templates and a single source-of-truth intake log, then enforcing a lightweight automated QA gate so every output includes complete provenance (verbatim claims, citations/URLs, and rights/licensing) and remains reproducible and auditable.

4. [CONSOLIDATED] Standardize all deliverable generation around a single canonical, reproducible `/outputs` workspace—complete with templates/scaffolding, an explicit indexed artifact registry (with resolved paths), and schema/checklist-based QA plus automated rights/licensing logging—so every output is consistently organized, discoverable, traceable, and legally reviewable end-to-end across cycles.
