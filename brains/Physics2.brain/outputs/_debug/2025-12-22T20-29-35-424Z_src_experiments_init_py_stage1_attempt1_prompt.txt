You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement prototype numerical / symbolic experiments that illustrate the behavior or consequences of the most promising candidate framework(s). This may include: toy-model simulations, symbolic derivations (e.g., effective action, renormalization flow), entanglement structure diagnostics, or small-scale lattice/graph models demonstrating emergence of classicality from quantum rules. Produce reproducible code and example outputs (plots, tables).
Project: generated_script_1766435373331 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/experiments/__init__.py
- Purpose: Package initializer for the experiment suite exposing the public experiment registry interface.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- README.md: Project overview with quickstart commands and a description of the included toy-model experiments and expected outputs.
- pyproject.toml: Python project configuration specifying dependencies, optional extras, and tool settings for reproducible runs.
- src/experiments/registry.py: Experiment registry and CLI-discoverable metadata that standardizes inputs/outputs across simulations and symbolic derivations.
- src/experiments/shared.py: Shared utilities for RNG seeding, result saving, table formatting, and cached diagnostic computations used by all experiments.

Key requirements:
- examples

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Package initializer for the experiment suite exposing the public experiment registry interface.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/experiments/__init__.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/experiments/__init__.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/experiments/__init__.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
