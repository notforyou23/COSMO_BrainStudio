      "summary": "1) Areas of agreement\n- All branches aim to make “semiclassical validity” operational and comparable across systems by producing concrete diagnostics (numbers, time-series, or datasets) rather than vague statements.\n- Each emphasizes short-time behavior and the need to compare semiclassical predictions against exact quantum evolution (Branch 1 and 3 explicitly; Branch 2 via fidelity/Loschmidt echo).\n- All three recognize the utility of system-specific indicators (Branch 1: Lyapunov/Ehrenfest times; Branch 2: KS entropy; Branch 3: a fixed physical scenario) to contextualize when semiclassical approximations break down.\n- Reproducibility and standardization are implicit in every branch: Branch 1 suggests metric-based comparisons, Branch 2 a single scalar yardstick, Branch 3 an explicit publishable dataset and code.\n\n2) Conflicting points\n- Granularity vs. reductionism:\n  - Branch 1 advocates a multi-metric benchmark (fidelity, phase-space negativity, observables, decay relative to classical timescales). Branch 2 argues for a single scalar (KS entropy mapped to fidelity decay). Single-number simplicity (Branch 2) can omit important features captured by the multi-metric approach (Branch 1).\n- Applicability domain:\n  - Branch 2 depends on a well-defined classical chaotic limit and a meaningful KS entropy. That fails or is ambiguous for many quantum systems (few-degrees-of-freedom, integrable systems, field theories, or systems without a clean chaotic classical limit). Branch 3 targets QFT in curved spacetime (evaporating black hole / de Sitter), where classical phase-space chaos and KS entropy are not directly applicable.\n- Observable choice:\n  - Branch 1 focuses on state-based and phase-space diagnostics (fidelity, negativity, entanglement). Branch 3 focuses on local field-theory observables and cumulants (⟨T_{μν}⟩ mean and variance). These probe different physics — global coherence vs. local backreaction — and one cannot substitute for the other.\n- Predictive vs. empirical benchmark:\n  - Branch 2 proposes a predictive scalar (KS → fidelity decay). Branches 1 and 3 are more empirical/comparative: measure quantities and compare. Unproven assumption in Branch 2: universal, quantitatively reliable mapping from KS to quantum-coherence times.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, prioritized)\n- Adopt a hierarchical, hybrid benchmarking framework:\n  1. Core metric suite (Branch 1 as foundation): establish a minimal, mandatory set of diagnostics to always report:\n     - State fidelity/Loschmidt echo (time series)\n     - Phase-space negativity / Wigner-function features\n     - Short-time entanglement growth (e.g., subsystem purity or Rényi-2)\n     - Observable-level errors for relevant operators (means + variances)\n     - Characteristic timescales (Ehrenfest time, classical Lyapunov exponents if defined)\n  2. System-specific predictor(s) (Branch 2 as optional layer): where a clear classical chaotic limit exists, measure classical chaos indicators (KS entropy, Lyapunov spectrum) and empirically test/fit their relation to short-time fidelity decay. Do not assume universality — treat KS-derived scalars as hypotheses to validate, not as replacements for the core suite.\n  3. Canonical reproducible scenarios (Branch 3 as exemplars and stress tests): publish full datasets, code, and regulator/initial-condition choices for a small curated set of benchmark problems spanning regimes:\n     - Quantum chaotic few-body systems (e.g., kicked rotor, stadium billiard)\n     - Semiclassical many-body systems where phase-space methods apply\n     - Field-theory / curved-spacetime scenarios (evaporating black hole, de Sitter patch) with time-series of ⟨T_{μν}⟩ and cumulants computed both semiclassically and by (as exact as feasible) mode-sum/numerical QFT\n- Immediate practical steps\n  1. Convene a short working group (3–5 people) to define the core metric suite, precise definitions, and reporting format (time resolution, norms, error bars, regulator sensitivity).\n  2. Implement pilot studies:\n     - Two systems with clear classical limits to test KS→fidelity hypotheses and quantify when the scalar predictor works or fails.\n     - One curved-spacetime scenario from Branch 3 with published code/dataset to demonstrate the reproducible-dataset approach.\n  3. Create a public repository/template for benchmark submissions including: code, parameter files, exact-reference data, and a checklist showing which core metrics are reported.\n- Reporting guidance (short)\n  - Always report the full time-series for core metrics plus uncertainties and numerical/regulator details.\n  - If presenting a scalar predictor (KS or fitted decay rate), include the empirical fit, confidence intervals, and a statement of the domain of validity.\n\nSummary: Keep Branch 1 as the core multi-metric standard, treat Branch 2’s KS→fidelity idea as a useful but conditional predictor to be empirically validated, and adopt Branch 3’s reproducible-scenario practice to provide definitive testbeds. Prioritize formalizing the metric suite, running pilots to validate scalar predictors, and publishing shared datasets and code."
