Scope, motivation, and what is *missing* (2020–2025)\nThis review is motivated by a specific gap identified in 2020–2025: it is *difficult to point to a single, comprehensive, cross-approach quantum-gravity review* that spans the full landscape (string theory, loop quantum gravity, spin foams, causal dynamical triangulations, causal sets, asymptotic safety, group field theory, etc.). What partially fills that gap are **cross-cutting special-issue editorials** and “mapping” pieces that organize the landscape around shared conceptual and technical threads—**most prominently renormalization-group (RG) ideas and coarse graining**. The present article therefore adopts a deliberately cross-program lens: rather than attempting an encyclopedic survey of each approach, it uses **RG/coarse-graining** as the organizing principle and treats different quantum-gravity programs as distinct implementations of a common agenda—connecting microscopic degrees of freedom to emergent semiclassical spacetime and, eventually, phenomenology.\n\nThe scope is anchored in concrete developments explicitly highlighted in the knowledge base: (i) a shift in **spin-foam LQG (2018–2025)** from primarily kinematical results toward **continuum recovery via background-independent renormalization and coarse graining**, including tensor-network-inspired tools; (ii) increasing use across **discrete approaches** of **phase diagrams and critical behavior** (often numerically) as **proxies for continuum limits** and for identifying emergent semiclassical regimes; (iii) in string-based quantum gravity, the dominance of **holography** as the sharpest nonperturbative definition where duals exist, and of the **swampland program** as a constraint framework shaping cosmology-facing syntheses; and (iv) explicit claims (circa a 2021 special-issue framing) that RG/coarse graining is a **unifying conceptual and technical thread** across programs.\n\nThis section will also set the review’s boundaries: we will emphasize **continuum limits, universality, fixed points, refinement/coarsening maps, and phase structure**, while treating program-specific foundations only insofar as they directly support these goals. The section ends by stating the review’s core question: **what is the status (2020–2025) of identifying universal continuum physics from background-independent microscopic models, and how do different programs operationalize that identification?**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Unifying thread: RG and coarse graining as a cross-program “translation layer”\nA central finding from the memory nodes is that **RG/coarse-graining ideas are explicitly presented (circa 2021 special-issue framing)** as a unifying thread across quantum-gravity programs, with the shared aim of relating microscopic spacetime models to emergent semiclassical behavior and, ultimately, phenomenology. This section formalizes that thread into a “translation layer” that can be used across otherwise disparate frameworks. The goal is not to impose a single definition of RG, but to show how each program substitutes for the role played by scale separation and coarse graining in standard quantum field theory.\n\nA key technical point arising in background-independent contexts is that **geometric length scales are not fundamental inputs**. Instead, background-independent RG replaces physical length with measures tied to underlying degrees of freedom. A concrete instance provided is the framing in tensor models: **background-independent RG replaces geometric length scales with quantities like tensor size/rank**, and **fixed points** are interpreted as candidates for **universal continuum limits** (explicitly referenced to Eichhorn–Koslowski–Pereira 2018, arXiv:1811.12909). This provides a template: define a notion of “effective description” along a refinement/coarsening hierarchy; compute flows of couplings/weights under that change of description; search for fixed points and critical surfaces; and interpret universality as independence from microscopic details.\n\nWe also incorporate a methodological motif that recurs in the discrete approaches discussed: **phase diagrams and critical behavior** are used as practical markers of continuum physics, especially when analytic control is limited and numerical tools dominate. The review will therefore build a shared vocabulary: “continuum limit candidate,” “emergent semiclassical regime,” “effective diffeomorphism symmetry restoration,” and “universality class,” and will use it consistently across spin foams, CDT, tensor models, and related discrete formulations. The section ends by outlining why tensor-network ideas appear naturally here: they provide constructive coarse-graining schemes when the fundamental objects are combinatorial/discrete, and they can serve as diagnostics for whether RG steps are approaching a fixed point compatible with semiclassical geometry.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Spin-foam loop quantum gravity: from kinematics to continuum recovery (2018–2025)\nThe knowledge base identifies a specific trend: **spin-foam LQG (2018–2025)** has shifted emphasis from primarily kinematical results toward **continuum recovery via background-independent renormalization and coarse graining**. This section reviews that shift as a change in the center of gravity of the field—toward diagnosing and constructing continuum limits and toward understanding how effective spacetime symmetries, especially diffeomorphism symmetry, can re-emerge.\n\nTwo concrete developments anchor the narrative. First, coarse graining in spin foams is increasingly framed as **explicit refinement/coarsening maps between complexes**, and progress is organized around **RG flows defined via boundary data**. This is a distinctive, program-specific operationalization: instead of RG defined by momentum shells in a background metric, the RG transformation is implemented through changes in discretization/complex while tracking how amplitudes or effective descriptions transform on boundaries. Second, there is explicit emphasis on **practical numerical and tensor-network renormalization schemes**, including **tensor network renormalization for spin nets/foams**, as tools to compute and explore these flows.\n\nThe section will then connect these techniques to the key physics targets: identifying **fixed points** (as continuum limit candidates), characterizing their universality properties, and diagnosing whether the resulting large-scale behavior matches expectations for semiclassical geometry. The memory nodes also emphasize a specific aim: tensor-network-inspired methods are used to **diagnose continuum limits and restore effective diffeomorphism symmetry**. Accordingly, the review will treat “effective diffeomorphism symmetry restoration” as a primary diagnostic for success: coarse graining should not merely produce stable flows, but flows consistent with the reappearance of the gauge symmetry structure associated with continuum GR.\n\nFinally, we will highlight the importance of “signals” of RG structure in the spin-foam setting. A representative example explicitly provided is a **Physical Review Letters** reference (PhysRevLett.117.141302) cited as a “representative spin-foam RG signal.” This section uses that as a signpost for the broader development: the field is increasingly defined by the ability to compute and interpret RG behavior—not merely define kinematics.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Discrete quantum gravity via phase structure: CDT and the logic of continuum limits\nDiscrete approaches increasingly use **phase diagrams and critical behavior (often numerically)** as proxies for identifying **continuum limits** and for locating **emergent semiclassical regimes**. This section uses **causal dynamical triangulations (CDT)** as the clearest example explicitly present in the knowledge base, anchored by the cited CDT review **arXiv:1905.08669**. The guiding logic is pragmatic: when a microscopic model is defined as a sum over discrete geometries, the continuum theory is expected to emerge near critical points in parameter space where correlation lengths (or their background-independent analogues) diverge, and where universal large-scale behavior becomes insensitive to microscopic details.\n\nThe section will explain how CDT fits into the review’s unifying RG/coarse-graining lens even when the primary tools are numerical. Phase structure becomes the “RG laboratory”: mapping phases and identifying phase transitions substitutes for analytic RG flows in many settings. The review will emphasize the role of **critical behavior** as a proxy for continuum physics: critical points are interpreted as candidates where the discrete theory can be tuned to produce continuum observables, and extended “semiclassical” regions in the phase diagram serve as candidate macroscopic spacetime regimes.\n\nThe section then draws an explicit bridge to spin foams: the same proxy logic—**phase diagrams and criticality as continuum markers**—also appears in spin-foam RG/coarse graining developments. This parallel is one of the most important cross-program connections in the memory nodes: it suggests that even when underlying degrees of freedom and amplitudes differ drastically, the operational definition of “progress toward continuum spacetime” is converging on shared diagnostics.\n\nFinally, the section will position CDT within the broader “discrete RG” storyline: CDT provides a prominent, mature case where numerical phase structure is central, and therefore functions as a benchmark for how far other discrete approaches might push analogous phase-diagram-driven continuum searches.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Background-independent RG in tensor models (and adjacent combinatorial frameworks)\nA distinctive contribution from the memory nodes is the explicit formulation of **background-independent RG** in tensor models: rather than using geometric length as an RG parameter, one uses measures tied to the fundamental degrees of freedom, and interprets fixed points as continuum limit candidates. The key cited anchor is **Eichhorn–Koslowski–Pereira (2018), arXiv",
