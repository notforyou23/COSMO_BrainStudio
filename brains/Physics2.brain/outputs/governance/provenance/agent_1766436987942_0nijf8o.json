      "summary": "1) Areas of agreement\n- Need for concrete, quantitative benchmarks that let competing semiclassical / quantum-gravity proposals be compared against observational signatures (ringdown, Hawking flux, entanglement-related diagnostics).\n- Focus on a small set of observables: quasi‑normal-mode/ringdown behaviour, horizon/flux deviations, and information-theoretic diagnostics (Page curve / entanglement growth, scrambling).\n- Value of model-independent parametrizations that are Planck‑suppressed and map to phenomenology (so different theories can be placed on common axes).\n- Practical reproducibility and numerical output matter: comparisons require code, datasets and standard formats.\n\n2) Conflicting points (and practical tensions)\n- Observable vs. theoretical diagnostics:\n  - Branch 1 prioritizes information‑theoretic measures (entanglement entropy, OTOCs) as the primary transition markers. These are conceptually compelling but often not directly observable for astrophysical black holes and are difficult to compute or measure across many models.\n  - Branch 2 emphasizes immediately observable phenomenology (R(ω), ℓc → ringdown echoes, phase shifts). This is experimentally accessible but may not capture the deep information‑theoretic aspects Branch 1 argues are the true indicators of semiclassical breakdown.\n- Level of abstraction / completeness:\n  - Branch 2’s (ℓc, R(ω)) is compact and directly maps to ringdown, but risks oversimplifying or missing phenomena that are not well represented by a single reflectivity/coherence-length parametrization (e.g., nonlocal correlations, strong deviations in the radiation spectrum, multi-scale structure).\n  - Branch 1’s diagnostics are powerful for identifying when semiclassical gravity fails, but they do not by themselves prescribe a compact phenomenological mapping that can be immediately fitted to gravitational‑wave data.\n- Practicality vs. ideal diagnostics:\n  - Branch 3 is pragmatic: enforce a reproducible benchmark suite and open repository. It implicitly sidelines theoretical contention by focusing on numerical deliverables. This is complementary but may frustrate proponents who see specific diagnostics (Branch 1) or simple parametrizations (Branch 2) as essential.\n- Mapping problem:\n  - There is a nontrivial mapping problem: how do entanglement/OTOC diagnostics (Branch 1) translate into an effective R(ω) and ℓc (Branch 2) that feed into observable ringdown shifts (Branch 3)? Current branches assume such mappings exist but differ on whether that mapping is primary or secondary.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise)\nSynthesis principle: Build a reproducible, modular benchmark infrastructure (Branch 3) that supports both phenomenological parametrizations (Branch 2) and theory‑level diagnostics (Branch 1) and makes explicit the mapping between them. Operationalize via a tiered standard.\n\n- Tier definitions\n  - Tier A (Observational/Phenomenological): Required outputs for each model: R(ω) (complex), ℓc (or equivalent length scales), predicted ringdown/QNM spectrum (frequency shifts, damping, echo delays τecho ≈ 2ℓc/c), and Hawking flux deviations. These are mandatory because they connect directly to data.\n  - Tier B (Information diagnostics): Optional but strongly encouraged outputs: entanglement entropy vs. time (Page curve where definable), OTOCs or scrambling times, and any model‑specific measures of geometry–matter correlations. Provide standardized units and numerical conventions so comparisons are meaningful.\n  - Tier C (Model metadata & provenance): Code version, numerical resolution, assumptions, parameter ranges (mass, spin), and links to analytic derivations or approximations.\n\n- Practical next steps (first 6 months)\n  1. Convene a small steering group (representatives of semiclassical/QG communities, GW data analysts, numerical relativity) to approve the benchmark spec.\n  2. Publish a minimal specification document: input parameters, required outputs, units, tolerances, and example toy models.\n  3. Stand up an open repository (git + continuous integration) with:\n     - Reference implementations: (i) simple reflective surface model implementing R(ω), ℓc; (ii) a toy entanglement model that outputs Page‑curve proxies; (iii) one or two community-provided model exporters (e.g., fuzzball/LQG-inspired).\n     - Validation tests and example datasets (mass/spin grid).\n  4. Define and publish mapping recipes: how, in practice, to compare a computed entanglement turnover or OTOC timescale to an effective coherence length ℓc and to features in R(ω). These can start as heuristic, with uncertainties, and be refined.\n  5. Run a community workshop/hackathon to seed contributions and refine the spec.\n\n- Short, actionable priorities for researchers\n  - If you have a model that gives entanglement/OTOC diagnostics but not R(ω): produce at least a heuristic mapping (e.g., correlate scrambling time → effective ℓc and expected echo delay) and add it to the repo.\n  - If you have a model giving R(ω)/ℓc but no entanglement diagnostics: compute or estimate a corresponding information‑theoretic proxy (e.g., expected change in Page time) where possible.\n  - All contributors should produce outputs on the same small grid of masses/spins so cross‑comparisons are immediate.\n\nBottom line: Use Branch 3’s infrastructure as the organizing vehicle, require Branch 2’s phenomenological outputs as the minimal observational interface, and incorporate Branch 1’s information‑theoretic diagnostics as higher‑value diagnostics with documented mapping recipes linking them to the phenomenological parameters. This preserves theoretical rigor while enabling immediate, reproducible comparisons against data."
