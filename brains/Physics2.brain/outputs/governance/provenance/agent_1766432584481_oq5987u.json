      "summary": "Summary (Cycle 35; divergence 0.90): the three branches share a common posture—classical assumptions (simple determinism, literal spacetime continuity, naive Lorentz invariance) are likely effective descriptions, not sacrosanct truths—but they differ on how to revise those assumptions and on the experimental/observational signatures to expect. Below are agreement points, explicit conflicts, and concise recommended next actions.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All three treat classical intuitions (simple local realism; exact smooth manifold; exact Lorentz invariance) as potentially emergent or approximate rather than fundamental.\n- Nontrivial quantum structure (entanglement, nonlocal correlations) plays a central role in any deeper account of reality. Branches 1 and 2 both put entanglement/quantum structure at the explanatory core.\n- Empirical contact is possible and necessary: Branch 1 motivates Bell-type and related foundational tests; Branch 3 motivates high-energy astrophysical time-of-flight tests; Branch 2 motivates looking for quantum-gravity signatures (and for consistency constraints linking microscopic models to low-energy geometry).\n- Conservatism about immediate overthrow: none of the branches claim current classical physics is useless; they aim to identify where and how it must be extended.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Determinism vs. relativistic structure:\n  - Branch 1 (deterministic hidden variables) typically requires nonlocal structure and, in relativistic extensions, often a preferred foliation or frame (e.g., most Bohmian proposals). That sits uneasily with exact Lorentz invariance/diffeomorphism symmetry expected in relativistic spacetime.\n- Continuity vs. discreteness and Lorentz invariance:\n  - Branch 2 advocates emergent continuity from discrete quantum connectivity; Branch 3 assumes discreteness at Planck scale that can produce energy-dependent propagation delays (violating exact Lorentz invariance). These are not logically incompatible, but there is a tension: not all discrete/emergent models imply observable Lorentz breaking. Many candidate quantum-gravity constructions preserve Lorentz symmetry in the continuum limit (or yield only Planck-suppressed, non-dispersive effects).\n- Phenomenology interpretation:\n  - Branch 3’s proposed signature (energy-dependent photon arrival times) can be confounded by source-intrinsic variability and astrophysical propagation effects. An observed delay would not uniquely indicate spacetime discreteness—could instead reflect source physics or other propagation mechanisms.\n- Implied ontologies:\n  - Branch 1’s realist determinism + nonlocal hidden variables imposes a specific ontology (beables and possibly a preferred time), which may be hard to embed in Branch 2’s picture of geometry emerging from relational entanglement without adding an extra structure that breaks relational symmetry.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Theoretical synthesis:\n  - Pursue models that try to reconcile deterministic nonlocal beables with emergent relativistic spacetime (e.g., deterministic dynamics on an underlying graph that yields Lorentz-invariant continuum behavior statistically). Key tasks: (a) construct toy models showing how a preferred microstructure can produce effective Lorentz symmetry at low energies; (b) derive concrete, model-specific phenomenological predictions (dispersion, anisotropies, decoherence rates).\n  - For emergent-spacetime programs, prioritize working out observationally distinct signatures beyond naive dispersion (e.g., modified correlation functions, entanglement-geometry relations, novel decoherence or noise spectra) and whether those preserve statistical Lorentz invariance.\n- Observational/experimental program:\n  - Continue high-energy time-of-flight analyses (Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, HESS, CTA), but strengthen controls: use population studies, multiwavelength contemporaneous lightcurves, and physically-motivated source emission models to separate source effects from propagation effects. Publish null-result constraints in model space (not only \"no delay\" but bounds on parameters of explicit microscopic models).\n  - Complement with other probes of Lorentz/CPT violation and of a preferred frame: precision laboratory tests (atomic clocks, clocks-in-motion), neutrino time-of-flight and oscillation studies, polarization birefringence searches, cosmic-ray / photon anisotropies. These probe different operator types and can help discriminate discrete+Lorentz-breaking scenarios from Lorentz-preserving emergent scenarios.\n  - Advance Bell/loophole-closing tests and experiments testing potential signaling/nonlocal structures, plus tabletop experiments sensitive to spontaneous collapse or gravity-related decoherence.\n- Cross-disciplinary integration:\n  - Create a targeted program linking specific microscopic proposals (e.g., graph/entanglement geometries, causal sets, Bohmian field theories) to a short list of falsifiable signatures across experiments: time-of-flight dispersion; decoherence/noise spectra; polarization rotation; anisotropic effects/ preferred-frame observables; Bell-type deviations. Rank signatures by feasibility and distinctiveness.\n- Prioritization (near term):\n  1. Tightened multi-source astrophysical time-lag analyses with explicit model marginalization for source effects.\n  2. Develop at least two concrete toy models that demonstrate (i) deterministic nonlocal microdynamics yielding emergent Lorentz-invariant continuum, and (ii) discrete-entanglement geometries that predict specific low-energy noise/entanglement signatures.\n  3. Coordinate complementary laboratory tests that can detect or constrain preferred-frame or decoherence signatures implied by deterministic hidden-variable proposals.\n\nShort takeaway: There is strong philosophical and practical alignment that classical assumptions are emergent. The main conflict is whether the deeper level enforces or breaks relativistic symmetry and whether discreteness necessarily creates observable dispersion. Focus next on concrete models that map microstructure -> low-energy signatures, and on multi-channel experimental searches that can discriminate source effects from fundamental propagation effects."
