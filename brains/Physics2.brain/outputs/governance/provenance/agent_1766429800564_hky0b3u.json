Rev. Lett.*, DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.57.2244)\n- Rovelli & Smolin loop-representation constraint dynamics (1990)\n- Ashtekar–Rovelli–Smolin graviton/Fock-space connection (1992)\n- Rovelli & Smolin spin-network basis (1995)\n\n**Translation (benchmark meaning):**\n- “microscopic model” in canonical LQG contexts typically means dynamics/kinematics built on **connection variables** and **spin-network** states (as the canonical basis milestone).\n\n**Benchmark implication:**  \nIf a benchmark compares “microscopic → semiclassical,” canonical LQG’s micro-side is naturally expressed in the connection/spin-network language (per the canonical milestone sequence), even though RG language is not specified in the notes for canonical LQG.\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 String-based quantum gravity (2020–2025): nonperturbative definition emphasis\nThe notes identify two pillars dominating string-based quantum gravity in this period:\n- **Holography**: “sharpest nonperturbative definition where duals exist”\n- **Swampland program**: constraints (Weak Gravity, Distance, no-global-symmetries, de Sitter-related conjectures) with syntheses oriented toward cosmology/testing restrictiveness.\n\n**Translation (benchmark meaning):**\n- When string-based work is benchmarked for “emergence/nonperturbative control,” the closest provided mapping is:\n  - “nonperturbative definition” ↔ **holography where duals exist**\n  - “constraint on low-energy effective theory space” ↔ **swampland constraints**\n\n**Important limit:**  \nNo normalization conventions for observables/dictionaries are given in the notes; only the strategic roles (definition/constraints) are.\n\n---\n\n### 2.4 Causal set theory: dynamics + QFT-on-causal-sets becoming predictive\n**Community term(s):**\n- “dynamics” improvements (path-integral setting; suppress non-manifold-like causal sets)\n- “QFT-on-causal-sets more predictive”\n- “QFT observables”: **entanglement entropy**, **in-in correlators/scattering**\n\n**Translation (benchmark meaning):**\n- “coarse-graining / emergence” target ↔ **manifold emergence**, operationalized partly by evidence that **non-manifold-like causal sets can be dynamically suppressed** (in a path-integral setting).\n- “observable bridge to phenomenology” ↔ computed **entanglement entropy** and **in-in correlators/scattering** on causal sets.\n\n**Benchmark implication:**  \nBenchmarks that require an “observable set” for discrete microstructure → phenomenology should treat:\n- entanglement entropy\n- in-in correlators/scattering  \nas the causal-set-side observable outputs explicitly named in the notes.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Observable and measurement conventions: translation across domains\n\n### 3.1 Analogue/emergent gravity experiments: Hawking-like emission and correlations\n**Platforms mentioned:** water waves, BECs, optics.  \n**Key reference points (as named in notes):**\n- Stimulated Hawking emission in water waves (PRL 2011)\n- Claims of spontaneous Hawking radiation with correlations in BECs (Nature Physics 2016)\n- Ongoing emphasis on **systematics/backreaction beyond fixed-background analogies**, including recent **number-conserving/backreaction** treatments.\n\n**Translation (benchmark meaning):**\n- “Hawking-like emission” ↔ analogue signal(s) consistent with Hawking-type mode conversion/emission **in an effective curved background**.\n- “correlations” ↔ correlation measurements used to support “spontaneous” Hawking-like claims (explicitly mentioned for BECs, 2016).\n\n**Normalization convention status:**  \nThe notes do not provide explicit amplitude/correlation-function normalization conventions. Benchmarking must therefore remain at the level of **which observable class** is used (emission vs correlation; stimulated vs spontaneous) and whether **systematics/backreaction** are addressed.\n\n**Empirical-traction note (BECs):**\n- Ultracold-atom BEC analogue gravity is described as providing the “most concrete empirical traction.”\n- Post-2016 work emphasizes stationarity, time evolution, robustness vs dispersive/finite-temperature effects, reflecting a push for **more falsifiable and metrologically credible tests**.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2 Decoherence / entanglement observables (open-system language)\nThe notes include a “Cycle 1 consistency review” synthesizing three branches about decoherence and gravity-induced dephasing.\n\n**Shared observable targets across branches:**\n- **Decoherence rates**\n- **Decoherence spectra**\n- **Scaling** with parameters (mass/position/clock energy are mentioned as discriminants)\n\n**Engineering characterization conventions (Branch 1/3-aligned):**\n- Noise spectroscopy tools explicitly named: **CPMG**, **spin-echo**, **filter-function analysis**\n- Output to extract: **power spectral density** of dephasing\n- Controls: **dynamical decoupling** (Uhrig, concatenated, optimized sequences), plus error correction.\n\n**Gravity-induced decoherence signature (Branch 2 claim as summarized):**\n- Treated as an intrinsic, position-dependent dephasing channel tied to gravity/time dilation.\n- Predicts:\n  - dependence on **gravitational potential differences**\n  - a specific ordering: superpositions of “when” decohere before those of “where”\n- Benchmark experimental design requirement:\n  - differential experiments varying gravitational potential difference while holding local environment/engineered noise constant\n  - look for residual decoherence not removable by dynamical decoupling/error correction.\n\n**Translation (benchmark meaning):**\n- “Decoherence channel” ↔ a noise/dephasing process characterized by a spectral density",
