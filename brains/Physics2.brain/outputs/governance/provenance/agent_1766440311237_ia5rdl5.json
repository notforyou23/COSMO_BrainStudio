The closest grounded candidates are:\n- `outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py` (explicitly “CLI entrypoint”)\n- `src/cli.py` (exists per file manifest)\n\n### 2) An experiments module is evidenced — but not “toy_…”\nThe only directly quoted experiment code snippet is:\n\n- `symbolic_rg_flow.py` with module run instruction:\n  > `python -m experiments.symbolic_rg_flow --outdir outputs/rg`  \n  Source: item **12**\n\nThis snippet shows a valid Python header and imports:\n- `from __future__ import annotations`\n- `from dataclasses import dataclass`\n- `from pathlib import Path`\n- `import argparse`\n\nBut the mission says the syntax error is in **`src/experiments/toy_...`**, and the exact file is not provided in the memory list.\n\n**Implication:** The only experiment file content we can reference is `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow`. There is no grounded “toy_*” filename shown.\n\n### 3) CI / pytest context exists, but no failing output\nThere is mention of:\n- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` intended to run pytest and fail on mismatches  \n  Source: items **3** and **7**\n\nBut the actual content of `ci.yml` and any pytest output are not included in the provided memory.\n\n---\n\n## Why I cannot “fix the reported syntax errors” with the current data\n\nTo fix a syntax error in a specific file, we need at minimum one of:\n- the file content (or at least the erroneous section), or\n- the exact `SyntaxError` traceback with file path + line number + offending token/line.\n\nThe provided knowledge contains neither for:\n- `qg_bench/cli.py`\n- `src/experiments/toy_...` (exact file unspecified)\n\nIt also contains no captured `pytest -q` output confirming failures or subsequent passes.\n\nBecause the instruction is to be “grounded in the research data” and to use “ONLY the specific facts and findings provided,” I cannot invent file contents, error messages, or test outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Concrete, minimal information needed to complete the mission (and why)\n\nTo proceed deterministically (and to produce a verifiable patch), you need to supply **one** of the following bundles:\n\n### Bundle A (best): traceback + file content excerpt\n1. The exact `pytest -q` failing output showing the syntax errors:\n   - file path(s)\n   - line number(s)\n   - error snippet\n2. The relevant sections (or full contents) of:\n   - `qg_bench/cli.py`\n   - the exact `src/experiments/toy_*.py` file referenced\n\n### Bundle B: just the files\nProvide the full contents of:\n- `qg_bench/cli.py`\n- the exact `src/experiments/toy_*.py` file\n\nThen the syntax errors can be found by inspection and corrected.\n\n### Bundle C: repository tree confirmation\nIf `qg_bench/cli.py` does not exist, confirm the intended file is instead one of the known CLI candidates evidenced in memory:\n- `outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py` (explicitly described as CLI entrypoint)\n- `src/cli.py` (present in file list)\n\n---\n\n## What I can responsibly infer as likely “fix targets” (without claiming edits)\n\nGiven the mismatch between the mission’s `qg_bench/cli.py` and the evidenced CLI files, the most plausible interpretation (still only a hypothesis) is:\n\n- The syntax error may actually be in **`outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py`** (explicitly “CLI entrypoint”), *or* **`src/cli.py`**, rather than `qg_bench/cli.py`.\n\nSimilarly, for experiments:\n- The only experiment entrypoint shown is `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow` (item **12**), but the mission says “toy_…”. Without the exact path, we cannot identify the failing file.\n\nI am not asserting this is correct—only that these are the only CLI/experiment-like artifacts grounded in the provided knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the supplied memory items, it is **not possible** to complete the requested workflow (edit specific files, rerun `pytest -q`, rerun a CLI example, and confirm success) in a way that is both **self-contained** and **strictly grounded** in the provided evidence. The knowledge base does not include:\n\n- the contents of `qg_bench/cli.py`,\n- the identity/contents of the `src/experiments/toy_...` file,\n- any actual syntax error traceback,\n- any recorded `pytest -q` run output,\n- any recorded CLI example run output (other than the separate `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow` run instruction).\n\nIf you provide either the failing `pytest -q` traceback(s) or the contents of the two target files, I can produce precise, line-specific syntax fixes and (separately) outline exactly what `pytest -q` and the CLI run should show after the patch—without inventing results.",
