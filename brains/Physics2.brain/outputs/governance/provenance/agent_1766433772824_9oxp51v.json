      "summary": "Summary judgment\n- All three branches share the same objective: extract continuum (and infinite-volume) physics from regulator‑regulated calculations with controlled, quantified systematics.\n- They differ mainly in strategy: (1) traditional Symanzik/tuning viewpoint, (2) learned/adaptive RG as an alternative representation, (3) rigorous global‑fit + benchmarking and cross‑validation practice.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Universality: different regulators that are tuned to the same RG fixed point give identical continuum physics up to irrelevant operators.\n- Irrelevant operators are the dominant discretization error; these can be characterized and reduced rather than being fundamental obstacles.\n- Improving control over irrelevant-operator effects is essential (either by analytic improvement, nonperturbative renormalization, or by changing the basis).\n- Quantification of uncertainties is required: continuum and infinite-volume extrapolations must propagate correlations and estimate systematic/model error.\n- Cross-checks between codes/ensembles and blinded tests are valuable to diagnose residual systematics rather than conflating analysis choices with physics differences.\n\n2) Conflicting points (or tension areas)\n- Methodology vs representation:\n  - Branch 1: emphasizes traditional Symanzik improvement and tuning bare couplings to reach the critical surface; views extrapolation (O(a^n) removal) as the primary tool.\n  - Branch 2: proposes replacing brute‑force extrapolation with a learned multiscale basis that absorbs cutoff artifacts so the continuum is read off from a fixed‑point representation. This shifts the problem toward model selection and training rather than explicit O(a^n) expansions.\n  Tension: whether the continuum should be obtained by systematic extrapolation (with known operator expansions) or by changing the representation to make extrapolation unnecessary.\n- Error accounting:\n  - Branch 1 relies on controlled power‑counting and Symanzik theory to predict leading cutoff scalings.\n  - Branch 2 frames discretization errors as model-selection/model-fitting uncertainty in the learned basis; this can obscure analytic power‑counting unless constrained.\n  Tension: analytic control vs potentially more powerful but less transparent learned representations.\n- Practical validation:\n  - Branch 3 emphasizes standardized global fits, common scales (e.g., w0), shared benchmark ensembles and blinded synthetic data to isolate systematics.\n  - Branch 2’s adaptive/learned methods may require different diagnostics and validation procedures (e.g., assessing overfitting, stability under changes in training priors), which are not yet part of standard benchmarking.\n  Tension: how to validate novel learned approaches under the existing benchmarking framework.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Treat the branches as complementary and run a coordinated program with three strands:\n  A. Continue rigorous Symanzik-based improvement and nonperturbative renormalization (Branch 1).\n     - Extend improvement to next relevant orders where affordable; document expected O(a^n) coefficients and residuals.\n  B. Develop and validate learned multiscale bases as an augmentation, not a replacement (Branch 2).\n     - Use them to design improved actions/operators (i.e., inform Symanzik improvement) or as variance‑reduction/accelerating transformations.\n     - Constrain learned models with Symanzik power‑counting and known operator content (physics‑informed priors) to keep interpretability and guarantee universal limits.\n  C. Force rigorous, shared validation infrastructure (Branch 3).\n     - Agree on a small set of benchmark ensembles spanning spacings/volumes; adopt common nonperturbative scale definitions (w0/t0).\n     - Require global correlated fits that include Symanzik‑motivated terms and optional learned-basis correction terms; propagate full covariances.\n     - Use blinded synthetic data and cross-code comparisons to reveal residual systematics. For learned methods, also require cross-validation, stability checks under architecture/hyperparameter variations, and tests that extrapolated observables converge to the same continuum limit as Symanzik-extrapolated results.\n- Specific immediate tasks (prioritized)\n  1. Create 3–5 benchmark ensembles (multiple a, volumes, masses) and publish configurations + analysis recipes.\n  2. Run standard Symanzik global fits with full covariance to establish a baseline for continuum values and residuals.\n  3. Implement one or two learned-basis prototypes (wavelet/NN RG) constrained by operator priors; compare their continuum extraction to the baseline on the benchmarks.\n  4. Perform blinded synthetic‑data challenges to test whether learned methods can hide biases or spuriously reduce apparent discretization errors.\n  5. Standardize reporting: continuum central value, statistical error, Symanzik systematic from omitted higher operators, model uncertainty from learned-basis choices, and cross-code spread.\n\nShort rationale\n- Symanzik theory provides analytic control and a predictable error model; global fits + shared benchmarks provide reproducible validation. Learned RG promises practical reductions in cutoff effects and computational savings, but must be physics‑informed and rigorously validated before replacing extrapolation. Combining all three yields better control, improved efficiency, and trustworthy continuum results."
