        "approach": "## Computational execution plan (1–3 concrete experiments)\n\n### Experiment 1 — Reproduce and localize syntax errors (baseline)\n**Goal:** Confirm the repo currently fails to parse and pinpoint exact files/lines.\n\n**Inputs required**\n- Local checkout of the repository (all source files)\n- Python interpreter (same version as project expects, e.g., `python --version`)\n- Installed dependencies sufficient to import/collect tests (at minimum: `pytest`)\n\n**Commands / procedure**\n1. Run a full parse/bytecode compilation pass:\n   ```bash\n   python -m compileall -q .\n   ```\n2. If needed for more precise traceback/line numbers on specific files, compile them directly:\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile qg_bench/cli.py\n   python -m py_compile src/experiments/toy_*.py\n   ```\n3. (Optional but helpful) Collect tests to see if parsing breaks during collection:\n   ```bash\n   pytest -q --collect-only\n   ```\n\n**Expected outputs that answer the experiment**\n- Terminal output showing `SyntaxError` traces with filenames + line numbers (at least `qg_bench/cli.py` and the referenced `src/experiments/toy_...` file).\n- A baseline record of failing files to verify later that fixes worked.\n\n---\n\n### Experiment 2 — Fix the syntax errors and verify parsing succeeds repo-wide\n**Goal:** Edit the offending files to remove syntax errors and confirm `compileall` succeeds.\n\n**Inputs required**\n- The specific error locations from Experiment 1\n- Ability to edit files (IDE/editor)\n- Project formatting/linting rules if applicable (optional)\n\n**Procedure**\n1. Open and fix the reported syntax errors in:\n   - `qg_bench/cli.py`\n   - `src/experiments/toy_....py` (the exact file identified by compile output)\n2. Re-run compilation across the entire repository:\n   ```bash\n   python -m compileall -q .\n   ```\n\n**Success criteria / outputs**\n- `python -m compileall -q .` finishes with **no errors** (exit code 0).\n- No remaining `SyntaxError` reports anywhere in the repo.\n\n---\n\n### Experiment 3 — Run unit tests to confirm test collection and execution succeeds\n**Goal:** Ensure the repo not only parses but also passes tests (or at least reaches actual test failures rather than syntax failures).\n\n**Inputs required**\n- Test dependencies installed (from `requirements*.txt` / `pyproject.toml`)\n- Any environment variables or test data required by the project (if documented)\n\n**Commands / procedure**\n1. Run the test suite:\n   ```bash\n   pytest -q\n   ```\n\n**Success criteria / outputs**\n- `pytest -q` completes without syntax/collection errors.\n- Ideal: all tests pass (`exit code 0`).\n- If tests fail for reasons unrelated to syntax, capture the failure summary to separate “parsing fixed” from “logic/test” issues.\n\n---\n\n## Final “done” condition (what answers the overall goal)\nYou’ve met the goal when you can provide:\n1. A diff/patch showing syntax fixes in `qg_bench/cli.py` and the relevant `src/experiments/toy_...` file.\n2. Clean output (or exit code 0) from:\n   ```bash\n   python -m compileall -q .\n   ```\n3. Clean output (or at minimum no syntax/collection errors) from:\n   ```bash\n   pytest -q\n   ```",
