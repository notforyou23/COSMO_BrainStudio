The deliverable should (a) map each program’s RG/coarse-graining methods, assumptions, and characteristic scales, (b) identify common technical tools and notation and propose a minimal shared glossary/translation guide, and (c) provide a contributor recruitment and governance template to ensure cross-program balance and an updating workflow for a living document.",
