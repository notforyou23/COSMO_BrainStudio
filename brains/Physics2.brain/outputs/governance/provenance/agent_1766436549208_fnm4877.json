    "mission": "Survey the current theoretical and experimental literature connecting discrete-gravity proposals (e.g., causal sets, discrete spectra) to quantum-field-theory-in-curved-spacetime frameworks (pAQFT/AQFT) and analogue platforms (BECs, optical simulators, metamaterials). Produce a concise, referenced inventory of candidate observables (correlators, spectral/dispersion signatures, entanglement measures), existing or proposed measurement protocols, and experimental/astrophysical platforms, highlighting gaps that must be addressed by controlled simulations and statistical inference pipelines.",
