      "summary": "Summary: The three branches share some high‑level aims (clarify gravity’s role with quantum systems) but diverge sharply on whether gravity is a quantum information carrier or an intrinsic, geometry‑driven decoherer/collapse mechanism. The reported divergence score (0.93) is consistent with substantial conceptual disagreement.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All branches agree that resolving the interface of gravity and quantum mechanics requires new ideas and decisive, low‑energy experiments.\n- Branches 1 and 3 converge on the importance of operational tests probing whether gravitational degrees of freedom can behave quantumly (i.e., carry entanglement or be emergent from quantum microphysics).\n- There is consensus that experiments must minimize non‑gravitational interactions (electromagnetic, Casimir, thermal noise) and use cryogenic, well‑isolated platforms with mesoscopic masses and long coherence times.\n- All accept that conceptual clarity (about background independence, what “quantum gravity” predicts at low energy, and how phase coherence is maintained) is necessary to interpret experiments.\n\n2) Conflicting points\n- Ontology of gravity:\n  - Branch 3 (and implicitly Branch 1’s operational strand) treats gravity as potentially quantum and testable via entanglement generation (BMV protocol). If positive, that supports gravity as a quantum mediator.\n  - Branch 2 posits that gravitational time dilation acts as an unavoidable, geometry‑dependent decoherer/collapse mechanism that selects definite outcomes—an effectively classical, entropy‑related role for spacetime that would prevent gravity from mediating entanglement in macroscopic superpositions.\n- Implications for experiments:\n  - If Branch 2’s decoherence/collapse mechanism is correct at accessible scales, BMV‑type setups would systematically fail to show gravity‑mediated entanglement even under ideal isolation; a null result would be interpreted as fundamental decoherence, not merely insufficient isolation.\n  - Branch 1’s emphasis on emergent spacetime and radical new principles does not directly predict short‑scale decoherence vs entanglement, but leans toward models where spacetime and its geometry arise from entanglement (contradicting Branch 2’s classicalizing role of geometry).\n- Direction of theory:\n  - Branch 1 calls for tools that make spacetime emergent from quantum degrees of freedom (e.g., entanglement‑geometry dualities, discrete causal sets), implying gravity ought to be compatible with quantum information flow.\n  - Branch 2 ties the measurement problem to spacetime thermodynamic gradients, implying new physics that enforces objective collapse tied to curvature/time‑dilation—this is incompatible with a simple quantum‑mediator picture unless collapse is negligible at experimental scales.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, prioritized)\n- Experimental priority: pursue high‑sensitivity BMV‑style tests (Branch 3) with parallel control experiments designed to distinguish genuine absence of entanglement from environment‑induced decoherence:\n  - Use masses in the 10^-15–10^-14 kg range, separations 10–100 μm, ms–s coherence times; implement rigorous EM/Casimir suppression, vibration isolation, cryogenic temperatures, and independent checks of background noise.\n  - Include tunable parameters that change proper‑time differences (e.g., controlled gravitational potential or redshift) so that any decoherence correlated with geometry/time dilation can be identified.\n  - Perform tomography or Bell‑type witnesses that are robust to small residual classical couplings.\n- Targeted null‑hypothesis tests for Branch 2:\n  - Design experiments where predicted gravity‑induced decoherence (from Branch 2 models) has a quantitatively distinct scaling with mass, separation, and proper‑time difference from ordinary environmental decoherence. Measure scaling laws to accept/reject those models.\n  - Carry out time‑dilation decoherence tests using internal clocks or Ramsey interferometry on spatially separated components to directly probe phase washout from proper‑time differences.\n- Theory program:\n  - Develop minimal, falsifiable models that interpolate between (a) gravity as a quantum mediator (predicting entanglement) and (b) gravity as a geometry‑induced decoherer/collapse mechanism. Extract concrete, scale‑dependent predictions (e.g., thresholds in mass or proper‑time difference).\n  - For Branch 1, produce low‑energy emergent‑spacetime models that explicitly predict how quantum information is encoded and what observational signatures (entanglement, modified noise spectra, deviations from standard QFT on curved spacetime) would appear.\n  - For Branch 2, formalize the collapse/decoherence mechanism in a relativistic, operationally testable way (including observer‑independence and entropy arrow assumptions) so its predictions can be compared to BMV and time‑dilation experiments.\n- Decision logic for interpreting results:\n  - If gravity‑mediated entanglement is observed (clear positive Bell/witness), this strongly favors Branch 3 and Branch 1‑like emergent/quantum descriptions; it rules out gravity‑as‑unavoidable‑collapse models at those scales.\n  - If no entanglement is observed but environmental sources are convincingly excluded and decoherence scales as predicted by Branch 2 models, this supports geometry‑driven decoherence/collapse and motivates theoretical development of collapse tied to spacetime gradients.\n  - If results are ambiguous, iterate: tighten isolation, vary proper‑time differences, and refine theoretical parameter spaces to identify discriminating regimes.\n\nConcise takeaway: Prioritize well‑controlled BMV‑style entanglement experiments coupled with direct time‑dilation decoherence probes and development of interpolating, falsifiable theoretical models. These combined paths will decisively discriminate whether gravity behaves as a quantum information carrier (supports Branches 1+3) or enforces objective, geometry‑linked collapse (Branch 2)."
