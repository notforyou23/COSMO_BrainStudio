      "summary": "Summary judgment\n- Overall: The three branches share a common hypothesis-space (entanglement as the root of spacetime/gravity and the hope of laboratory-accessible signatures) but diverge strongly on the degree of theoretical precision available today and on experimental feasibility. The divergence score (0.90) is consistent with strong conceptual overlap plus important practical/theoretical disagreements about how to make the idea quantitative and testable.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Core conceptual claim: Entanglement/information structure is a plausible organizing principle for emergent geometry and gravity. This is supported by multiple established lines of work (AdS/CFT entanglement–geometry results, Jacobson’s entropic derivation of Einstein equations, Van Raamsdonk, ER=EPR, tensor-network and quantum error-correction approaches).\n- Strategy: Progress requires (a) precise toy models that map entanglement measures to geometric quantities, and (b) identification of concrete observables or signatures that differ from classical GR and are in principle measurable.\n- Experimental approach: Tabletop quantum systems (optomechanical resonators, macroscopic quantum oscillators, controlled entangled fields) are the natural experimental arena for attempting to probe small departures from classical behavior; sophisticated quantum control, cryogenics, and noise rejection are prerequisites.\n- Key bottlenecks: (i) deriving fully general, local, Lorentzian Einstein dynamics from entanglement in non-AdS / non-conformal settings; (ii) distinguishing genuine quantum-gravitational effects from ordinary decoherence and technical noise; (iii) achieving sensitivity to effects that are expected to be extremely small.\n\n2) Conflicting points (where branches disagree or overstate feasibility)\n- Quantitativeness and regime of validity\n  - Branch 1 asks for a precise, testable framework where entanglement-entropy dynamics reproduce Einstein’s equations. Current literature provides many suggestive results (linearized or thermodynamic derivations, special backgrounds, holographic settings) but no universal, fully nonperturbative derivation in realistic (asymptotically flat, dynamical) spacetimes. So Branch 1 is optimistic about near-term precision; present theory is incomplete.\n- Direct mapping of entanglement gradients to the Einstein tensor\n  - Branch 2 asserts/asks whether gradients in multipartite entanglement can map quantitatively to the Einstein tensor (and tidal forces). In holographic and tensor-network analogues one can relate entanglement variations to metric perturbations (entanglement first law, modular Hamiltonian methods), but extending that to a local, covariant mapping in general QFTs is unresolved. So the existence of a simple local map is speculative.\n- Experimental accessibility and scale\n  - Branch 2 proposes a tabletop crossover from entanglement-dominated “effective geometry” to classical GR. That assumes an experimentally accessible parameter regime where entanglement-induced geometry is large enough to affect macroscopic motion—this is currently implausible: expected quantum-gravity corrections are many orders of magnitude below tabletop sensitivity unless new amplification mechanisms are found.\n- Decoherence as a quantum-gravity signature\n  - Branch 3 claims tiny decoherence patterns in macroscopic entangled systems might reveal spacetime quantization distinct from environmental noise. Practically, environmental decoherence effects are typically dominant and complex; isolating a distinct, model-predictable quantum-gravity decoherence channel requires concrete predictions for spectral, spatial, or state-dependent signatures that differ qualitatively from known noise. Such predictions are currently model-dependent and sparse.\n- Experimental proposals vs. required sensitivity\n  - Branch 2’s specific experimental prescription (coupling macroscopic resonators to controllable entangled fields) and Branch 3’s suggestion of measurable decoherence signatures may be technologically out of reach without either (a) a theoretical mechanism that amplifies the signal to accessible scales, or (b) extraordinary experimental sensitivity beyond current state of the art. The branches are therefore optimistic relative to current instrumentation.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\nShort-term theoretical program (priority 1)\n- Build concrete, controllable toy models linking entanglement dynamics to semiclassical gravity:\n  - Continue work in AdS/CFT, but also develop lattice/QFT and tensor-network toy models in flat-space or finite-volume settings; derive the exact conditions under which entanglement variations reproduce (linearized) Einstein equations.\n  - Focus on deriving scaling laws: size of geometric response vs. entanglement change, dependence on energy scales, locality conditions, and when semiclassical descriptions break down.\n  - Produce model-specific, quantitative predictions for observables (e.g., metric perturbations, modified tidal responses, state-dependent forces, decoherence rates) with clear parametric dependence on system size, entanglement entropy, and coupling strengths.\n\nMedium-term phenomenology and metrology (priority 2)\n- Translate model predictions into experimental figures of merit:\n  - For each model, compute required sensitivity (force, phase, decoherence rate), scaling with mass/size/temperature, and dominant backgrounds.\n  - Identify observables with the highest signal-to-noise ratio and the most distinctive signatures relative to known noise (nonthermal frequency dependence, nonlocal correlations, entanglement-state dependence, violation of classical fluctuation–dissipation relations).\n- Develop rigorous noise and null-test frameworks:\n  - Characterize environmental decoherence channels and design discriminants (correlation structure, dependence on controlled entanglement, reversibility tests).\n  - Use statistical hypothesis testing to compute required integration times and experimental resources.\n\nExperimental pilot projects (priority 3)\n- Design realistic table-top proof-of-principle experiments that are feasible with near-term quantum optomechanics/phononics:\n  - Optomechanical resonators or levitated masses with high Q, cryogenic temperatures, and quantum-limited readout; ability to prepare and vary entangled-field states that couple to the mechanical degrees of freedom.\n  - Experiments should aim first at detecting any entanglement-induced modification of mechanical observables predicted by explicit toy models (not full GR).\n- Build staged milestones:\n  - Stage A: Demonstrate controllable coupling between macroscopic resonator and an engineered entangled field; measure induced shifts/decoherence at predicted model levels.\n  - Stage B: Implement cross-correlation and null tests to rule out conventional noise mechanisms.\n  - Stage C (long-term): If signals survive, iterate with improved models and scaling up.\n\nCross-disciplinary coordination\n- Form a small, focused program combining theoretical quantum gravity, condensed-matter/tensor-network modeling, quantum information, and precision-experiment metrology. Deliverables: (i) prioritized list of toy models with quantitative predictions, (ii) experimental sensitivity sheets for candidate setups, (iii) prototype experiments with documented null-test protocols.\n\nConcrete near-term deliverables (within 12–24 months)\n- Produce 2–3 explicit toy models (one holographic, one lattice/tensor-network, one open-system model) with computed observables and sensitivity requirements.\n- A feasibility report mapping these observables to specific experimental platforms (optomechanics, levitated particles, superconducting circuits), including noise budgets and required improvements.\n- A small prototype experiment to test a model-predicted entanglement-induced mechanical effect at an experimentally reachable level (even if orders of magnitude below GR-scale effects)—the goal is to validate methods for discriminating quantum-gravity-like signals from noise.\n\nBottom line\n- Agreement: Entanglement-driven emergence of geometry is a promising, well-motivated research direction. All branches converge on the need for precise models and careful experiments.\n- Conflict: The main disagreements are about how directly or soon entanglement gradients can be mapped to the Einstein tensor and whether tabletop decoherence/resonator experiments can realistically detect quantum-gravity signatures. Current theory and technology do not yet justify expecting a direct GR-level crossover in tabletop experiments.\n- Recommended path: Prioritize quantitative"
