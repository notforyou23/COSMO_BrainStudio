        "content": "Below are the complete contents for the two files you asked for—**`benchmarks_v0_1.md`** and **`schema.json`**—defined using **only** the facts/themes present in the provided COSMO memory (2019–2025): operational/testable foundations; decoherence/noise spectroscopy with a gravity-sensitive residual channel; RG/coarse-graining as a cross-program thread (notably special-issue framing circa 2021, e.g. arXiv:2103.14605); causal-set push toward QFT observables (entanglement entropy, in-in correlators/scattering); analogue-gravity (BEC) Hawking-like emission/correlations with explicit attention to robustness/systematics/backreaction; and spin-foam/LQG’s shift toward continuum recovery via background-independent renormalization/coarse-graining and diagnosing restoration of effective diffeomorphism symmetry.\n\nNo detailed formulas, beta functions, or community-specific normalizations are assumed (explicitly noted as out-of-scope in the translation guide memory).\n\n---\n\n## `benchmarks_v0_1.md`\n\n```markdown\n# COSMO Benchmarks v0.1 (2019–2025 research-grounded)\n\nThis benchmark spec turns COSMO’s 2019–2025 accumulated themes into *machine-checkable* observables with explicit tolerances, required metadata, and explicit failure modes.\n\nGrounding constraints from the knowledge base used here:\n- **Operational/testable frameworks** are prioritized in foundations work (incl. causal modeling and indefinite causal order).\n- **Noise spectroscopy + dynamical decoupling** style analysis is used to characterize decoherence/noise, including a **gravity-sensitive residual channel** (described as scaling with gravitational potential differences).\n- **RG / coarse-graining** is explicitly framed (notably in 2021 cross-approach special-issue/editorial mappings, e.g. arXiv:2103.14605) as a *unifying thread* across quantum-gravity programs linking microscopic models to emergent semiclassical behavior/phenomenology.\n- **Causal sets** have pushed toward predictive, QFT-like observables: **entanglement entropy** and **in-in correlators/scattering**.\n- **Analogue gravity (BEC)** emphasizes Hawking-like emission and correlation signals *plus* robustness checks: systematics and backreaction.\n- **Spin-foam LQG (2018–2025)** shifts from kinematics toward continuum recovery via **background-independent renormalization/coarse-graining**, including tensor-network-inspired methods to diagnose continuum limits and **restoration of effective diffeomorphism symmetry**.\n\nImportant limitation (from translation-layer memory):\n- Detailed formulas, explicit beta functions, and canonical numeric values for exponents/coefficients are not provided in the knowledge base and are therefore not assumed. Benchmarks are designed around *internal consistency*, cross-checks, metadata completeness, and robustness/systematics structure.\n\n---\n\n## 0) Common output conventions (v0.1)\n\nAll benchmark outputs MUST be JSON objects with:\n\n- `benchmark_id` (string; one of the IDs below)\n- `version` (string; MUST equal `\"0.1\"`)\n- `run_id` (string; user-provided unique run label)\n- `metadata` (object; required, shared fields)\n- `inputs` (object; benchmark-specific)\n- `results` (object; benchmark-specific)\n- `checks` (array of objects `{check_id, passed, details}`)\n- `failure_modes` (array of objects; required even if empty)\n- `notes` (string; optional)\n\n### 0.1 Shared required metadata (ALL benchmarks)\n\nThe following metadata fields are required for every benchmark because COSMO’s accumulated knowledge emphasizes that conclusions depend on coarse-graining/RG choices, truncations, and regulators (cross-program RG thread; spin-foam coarse-graining/continuum recovery; robustness/systematics in analogue gravity).\n\nRequired fields:\n- `program_context` (string; e.g., `\"analogue_gravity_BEC\"`, `\"causal_set_QFT\"`, `\"spin_foam_LQG\"`, `\"foundations_noise_spectroscopy\"`, or other user-specified)\n- `rg_scheme` (string; REQUIRED even if `\"none\"`; because RG/coarse-graining is a cross-cutting thread)\n- `coarse_graining_description` (string; what degrees of freedom were integrated/blocked/aggregated)\n- `truncation` (string; REQUIRED even if `\"none\"`; explicit about what was retained/dropped)\n- `regulator` (string; REQUIRED even if `\"none\"`; explicit about the regulator choice where applicable)\n- `numerics` (object with at least `method` string and `tolerances` object; can be `\"analytic\"` if no numerics)\n- `data_provenance` (object; includes `source_type` string such as `\"simulation\"`, `\"experiment\"`, `\"derived\"`, and `source_ref` string)\n\nAdditionally required:\n- `timestamp_utc` (string; ISO-8601)\n- `code_version` (string; commit hash or equivalent)\n- `random_seed` (integer OR null; required field even if null)\n\n### 0.2 Pass/fail rule\n\nA benchmark PASSES iff:\n1) The JSON validates against `schema.json`.\n2) Every check in `checks` has `passed: true`.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Observable Benchmark: RG/Coarse-graining Scaling Collapse Proxy (internal consistency)\n\n### 1.1 Why this is in-scope (memory grounding)\n- COSMO notes that **RG/coarse-graining** is a cross-program technical thread (explicitly highlighted in 2021 cross-approach framing, e.g. arXiv:2103.14605) aimed at relating micro models to emergent semiclassical behavior.\n- Spin-foam LQG (2018–2025) specifically emphasizes **background-independent renormalization/coarse-graining** as a route to continuum recovery.\n\nBecause shared, numeric critical exponents are *not* provided, this benchmark enforces a **data-collapse consistency test** rather than “match known exponent X”.\n\n### 1.2 Observable definition\nGiven a set of runs at different coarse-graining levels or scales, the user provides:\n- raw curves `O_i(x)` each tagged by a scale label `s_i` (e.g., block size, RG step count, or another monotone scale proxy),\n- a chosen rescaling ansatz (user-specified; recorded),\n- and the *collapsed* curves `Ō_i(u)` on a common domain `u`.\n\nThe benchmark computes **collapse error**: a normalized RMS dispersion across curves on the overlap domain.\n\n### 1.3 Required inputs/results\nInputs MUST include:\n- `scales`: array of scale labels (strings or numbers)\n- `raw_curves`: array of `{scale, x: [...], y: [...]}` objects\n- `collapse_mapping`: freeform object describing the rescaling used (explicitly recorded)\n- `collapsed_curves`: array of `{scale, u: [...], y: [...]}`\n\nResults MUST include:\n- `collapse_error_rms` (number)\n- `overlap_fraction` (number in [0,1]) describing how much common domain is shared\n- `n_curves` (integer)\n\n### 1.4 Acceptance checks (explicit tolerances)\nBecause COSMO’s memory does not fix a universal numeric target, tolerances here are internal-quality thresholds:\n- **CHECK RG_SCALING_001 (collapse quality):**\n  - Pass if `collapse_error_rms <= 0.10`\n- **CHECK RG_SCALING_002 (overlap adequacy):**\n  - Pass if `overlap_fraction >= 0.70`\n- **CHECK RG_SCALING_003 (minimum evidence):**\n  - Pass if `n_curves >= 3`\n\n### 1.5 Required failure-mode fields (must be populated when applicable)\nFailure modes are mandatory structured records. This benchmark expects (at minimum) the following possible categories:\n- `insufficient_overlap` (e.g., curves do not share domain after rescaling)\n- `nonmonotone_scale_label` (scale proxy not consistent with ordering)\n- `collapse_sensitive_to_truncation` (collapse changes materially when truncation changes; must cite truncation string)\n- `regulator_dependence_flag` (collapse changes materially under regulator changes; must cite regulator string)\n- `numerical_instability` (e.g., interpolation artifacts)\n\n---\n\n## 2) Observable Benchmark: Two-point function shape + scaling (QFT-style correlator diagnostic)\n\n### 2.1 Why this is in-scope (memory grounding)\n- COSMO’s translation-layer notes list **in-in correlators/scattering** as explicit causal-set QFT observable types.\n- Two-point functions are the minimal correlator-shape diagnostic that can be computed across discrete/continuum-like approaches without requiring external normalization constants.\n\n### 2.2 Observable definition\nUser provides two-point function samples at multiple coarse-graining/RG conditions:\n- `G_i(r)` with `r` a separation proxy (graph distance, embedding distance, or experimental distance), and\n- an optional scaling map that rescales `r` and/or `G` to compare shapes across runs.\n\nThis benchmark checks:\n1) **Shape agreement** under the user-recorded scaling map,\n2) **Self-consistency** of the scaling across multiple coarse-graining levels.\n\n### 2.3 Required inputs/results\nInputs MUST include:\n- `separation_definition` (string; e.g. \"graph_distance\", \"embedding_distance\",",
