# COSMO Benchmarks v0.1 (2019–2025 research-grounded)

This file defines **benchmark observables** and **acceptance criteria** intended to make COSMO’s accumulated 2019–2025 foundations/quantum-gravity knowledge operational and testable. The benchmarks are limited to specific themes explicitly present in the knowledge base: operational/testable foundations; decoherence/noise characterization and a gravity-sensitive residual channel; RG/coarse-graining as a cross-program thread; causal sets’ push toward predictive QFT observables; and analogue-gravity (BEC) robustness checks.

All benchmarks share a common design principle reflected in the memory: **reduce interpretive drift by anchoring claims in formal constraints, calculational tools, and measurable/diagnosable observables** (operational frameworks; controlled QFT foundations; noise spectroscopy + dynamical decoupling; robustness/systematics checks; QFT observables on discrete structures).

## 0. Common conventions (v0.1)

### 0.1 Output object conventions
All benchmark outputs are **JSON objects** with:
- `benchmark_id` (string)
- `version` (string; must be `"0.1"`)
- `run_id` (string; user-provided)
- `inputs` (object; benchmark-specific)
- `results` (object; benchmark-specific, machine-checked fields emphasized)
- `checks` (array of `{check_id, passed, details}`)
- `notes` (string; optional)

### 0.2 Pass/fail conventions
A benchmark **passes** if and only if:
1) All required fields exist and match type/format constraints in `schema.json`.
2) All acceptance checks for that benchmark return `passed: true`.

## 1) Benchmark: Operational/Testable Foundations Anchoring

### 1.1 Motivation grounded in memory
Foundations work (2019–2025) increasingly prioritizes:
- **Operational/testable frameworks** (including causal modeling and indefinite causal order, info-theoretic reconstructions),
- plus **mathematically controlled QFT foundations** (pAQFT reviews; AQFT–factorization algebra bridges),
explicitly aiming to reduce purely interpretive drift by anchoring debates in formal constraints and calculational tools.

This benchmark checks whether a produced “foundations summary artifact” is anchored in those specified operational/mathematical handles rather than interpretive-only statements.

### 1.2 Observable
**Anchoring Coverage Vector (ACV)**: a set of boolean indicators that a report explicitly includes each of the following anchors:

A. `operational_frameworks_present` (causal modeling and/or indefinite causal order and/or info-theoretic reconstructions)  
B. `controlled_qft_foundations_present` (pAQFT and/or AQFT–factorization algebra bridges)  
C. `goal_reduce_interpretive_drift_stated` (explicitly states the purpose of anchoring to reduce interpretive drift)

This is a content-structure observable, not a scientific “truth” claim.

### 1.3 Inputs
- `artifact_text` (string): the report or excerpt to evaluate.
- `evidence_spans` (optional array): user-supplied spans to make evaluation auditable.

### 1.4 Outputs
- `results.acv` object with booleans:
  - `operational_frameworks_present`
  - `controlled_qft_foundations_present`
  - `goal_reduce_interpretive_drift_stated`
- `results.citations` array of objects:
  - `anchor` (enum: `"operational_frameworks" | "controlled_qft_foundations" | "reduce_interpretive_drift"`)
  - `supporting_text` (string snippet copied from `artifact_text`)

### 1.5 Acceptance criteria
Pass if:
1. All three ACV fields are `true`.
2. `citations` contains **at least one** snippet for each anchor category present in ACV.

## 2) Benchmark: Decoherence Noise-Spectroscopy + Dynamical-Decoupling Residuals (Gravity-sensitivity program)

### 2.1 Motivation grounded in memory
The Cycle 1 consistency review states:
- Decoherence is central; open-system viewpoint; engineering control matters (noise spectroscopy, dynamical decoupling, error correction).
- A key tension: a **potentially fundamental gravity-induced, position-dependent dephasing channel** (Branch 2) that might not be suppressible by DD/error correction.
- Recommended program: (1) characterize/suppress technical noise (noise spectroscopy such as CPMG/spin-echo/filter-function analysis; tailored DD like Uhrig/concatenated/optimized) then (2) search for residual environment-insensitive decoherence by varying **gravitational potential difference** while holding engineered noise and local environment fixed.
- Decision criterion: if after state-of-the-art suppression a reproducible residual remains whose **magnitude and scaling** match gravity-based expectations and is not attributable to technical/systematic sources, treat it as substantive; otherwise prioritize engineering.

This benchmark measures whether a dataset/report implements that two-phase logic and produces the key observable relationships (pre/post suppression; dependence on gravitational parameters).

### 2.2 Observables
Two linked observables:

**(O1) Noise Characterization Completeness (NCC)**  
Evidence that noise spectroscopy was performed and reported as a dephasing-noise PSD extraction attempt using at least one of: **CPMG, spin-echo, filter-function analysis**.

**(O2) Residual Decoherence Gravity-Scaling Test (RDGST)**  
A structured set of runs where:
- engineered noise/local environment are declared held constant,
- gravitational potential difference (or proxy parameter: “height difference”, “clock-rate shift”, etc.) is varied,
- decoherence metrics are reported post-DD (and optionally post-error-correction).

### 2.3 Inputs
- `runs` (array of run objects), each with:
  - `run_label` (string)
  - `phase` (enum: `"baseline" | "noise_spectroscopy" | "dd_applied" | "gravity_sweep"`)
  - `spectroscopy_method` (optional enum: `"CPMG" | "spin_echo" | "filter_function_analysis"`)
  - `dd_method` (optional enum: `"Uhrig" | "concatenated" | "optimized" | "none"`)
  - `environment_held_constant` (boolean; required for `gravity_sweep`)
  - `gravity_parameter_type` (optional enum: `"potential_difference" | "height_difference" | "clock_rate_shift" | "mass_separation_interferometer_parameter"`)
  - `gravity_parameter_value` (number; required for `gravity_sweep`)
  - `decoherence_metric` (object):
    - `metric_type` (enum: `"dephasing_rate" | "coherence_time" | "visibility"`)
    - `value` (number)
    - `units` (string)

### 2.4 Outputs
- `results.ncc`:
  - `spectroscopy_reported` (boolean)
  - `methods_used` (array of methods)
- `results.dd_effect`:
  - `dd_reported` (boolean)
  - `dd_methods_used` (array)
  - `coherence_extended_indicator` (boolean)  
    (true if there exists at least one pair of comparable runs with DD applied showing improved coherence by the chosen metric direction; see check details)
- `results.rdgst`:
  - `gravity_sweep_present` (boolean)
  - `constant_environment_declared` (boolean; true if all gravity_sweep runs set `environment_held_constant=true`)
  - `gravity_parameter_series` (array of `{value, decoherence_metric_value}`)
  - `scaling_claim` (enum: `"none" | "reported_scaling_with_gravity_parameter"`)
  - `environment_insensitive_residual_claimed` (boolean)

### 2.5 Acceptance criteria
Pass if all are true:
1. **NCC**: `spectroscopy_reported=true` and `methods_used` includes at least one of: `CPMG`, `spin_echo`, `filter_function_analysis`.
2. **DD**: `dd_reported=true` and `dd_methods_used` includes at least one of: `Uhrig`, `concatenated`, `optimized`.
3. **RDGST**: `gravity_sweep_present=true`.
4. For all runs with `phase="gravity_sweep"`: `environment_held_constant=true`. (This encodes the recommended differential design: vary gravitational parameters while holding engineered noise and local environment fixed.)
5. Output must explicitly mark whether an **environment-insensitive residual** is claimed and whether **scaling with gravitational potential difference / gravity parameter** is reported (`scaling_claim` not necessarily required to be affirmative; the benchmark is about structured reporting and the differential test).

## 3) Benchmark: Analogue-Gravity (BEC) Hawking-like Emission Robustness/Stationarity Reporting

### 3.1 Motivation grounded in memory
Analogue/emergent-gravity experiments probe QFT on effective curved backgrounds (Hawking-like emission and mode conversion). Key reference points include:
- stimulated Hawking emission in water waves (PRL 2011),
- claims of spontaneous Hawking radiation with correlations in BECs (Nature Physics 2016),
- post-2016 work in ultracold-atom BECs stressing **stationarity, time evolution, and robustness**
