## Status vs. Mission

The mission requires **(a)** fixing reported syntax errors in **`qg_bench/cli.py`** and **`src/experiments/toy_...`** (exact referenced file), then **(b)** rerunning **`pytest -q`** and the **CLI example** to confirm the fixes.

Using **only** the facts provided in the memory items, I cannot complete that mission as stated, because the required concrete inputs are missing:

- No memory node includes the contents of **`qg_bench/cli.py`** (or even confirms it exists in the filesystem).
- No memory node identifies the **exact `src/experiments/toy_...` path** that has the syntax error (only a separate example snippet for `symbolic_rg_flow.py` is shown).
- No memory node provides the **actual syntax error messages**, line numbers, or failing traceback from `pytest -q`.
- No memory node provides the **CLI example command** to run (the only explicit “Run:” line shown is for `python -m experiments.symbolic_rg_flow --outdir outputs/rg`).
- I do not have the ability, within these constraints, to actually execute `pytest -q` or run a CLI command and report real output—there are no recorded run logs for those commands in the supplied knowledge.

So I cannot truthfully claim to have “fixed” specific syntax errors in those specific files, nor that I reran `pytest -q` and a CLI example and saw them pass.

What I *can* do, grounded strictly in the provided knowledge, is: (1) identify what files are actually evidenced in memory that look like the relevant CLI and experiment entrypoints, (2) point out the mismatch with the mission’s filenames, and (3) specify exactly what additional concrete information is required to perform the edits and confirmations.

---

## What the provided evidence actually contains (file-level)

### 1) A CLI file exists in the knowledge — but it is **not** `qg_bench/cli.py`
The memory explicitly references:

- **`outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py`** (export task)  
  Source: item **5** (“Export the existing file at outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py … CLI entrypoint to run benchmarks end-to-end producing output files under outputs/ for local use and CI verification.”)

This is the only CLI file path explicitly tied to “benchmarks” and “CLI entrypoint” in the provided knowledge.

Additionally, another code-creation output lists:
- **`src/cli.py`** (size 6187)  
  Source: item **17** (file list includes `src/cli.py`)

**Implication:** The mission’s target file `qg_bench/cli.py` is not evidenced in the memory. The closest grounded candidates are:
- `outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py` (explicitly “CLI entrypoint”)
- `src/cli.py` (exists per file manifest)

### 2) An experiments module is evidenced — but not “toy_…”
The only directly quoted experiment code snippet is:

- `symbolic_rg_flow.py` with module run instruction:
  > `python -m experiments.symbolic_rg_flow --outdir outputs/rg`  
  Source: item **12**

This snippet shows a valid Python header and imports:
- `from __future__ import annotations`
- `from dataclasses import dataclass`
- `from pathlib import Path`
- `import argparse`

But the mission says the syntax error is in **`src/experiments/toy_...`**, and the exact file is not provided in the memory list.

**Implication:** The only experiment file content we can reference is `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow`. There is no grounded “toy_*” filename shown.

### 3) CI / pytest context exists, but no failing output
There is mention of:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` intended to run pytest and fail on mismatches  
  Source: items **3** and **7**

But the actual content of `ci.yml` and any pytest output are not included in the provided memory.

## Why I cannot “fix the reported syntax errors” with the current data

To fix a syntax error in a specific file, we need at minimum one of:
- the file content (or at least the erroneous section), or
- the exact `SyntaxError` traceback with file path + line number + offending token/line.

The provided knowledge contains neither for:
- `qg_bench/cli.py`
- `src/experiments/toy_...` (exact file unspecified)

It also contains no captured `pytest -q` output confirming failures or subsequent passes.

Because the instruction is to be “grounded in the research data” and to use “ONLY the specific facts and findings provided,” I cannot invent file contents, error messages, or test outcomes.

---

## Concrete, minimal information needed to complete the mission (and why)

To proceed deterministically (and to produce a verifiable patch), you need to supply **one** of the following bundles:

### Bundle A (best): traceback + file content excerpt
1. The exact `pytest -q` failing output showing the syntax errors:
   - file path(s)
   - line number(s)
   - error snippet
2. The relevant sections (or full contents) of:
   - `qg_bench/cli.py`
   - the exact `src/experiments/toy_*.py` file referenced

### Bundle B: just the files
Provide the full contents of:
- `qg_bench/cli.py`
- the exact `src/experiments/toy_*.py` file

Then the syntax errors can be found by inspection and corrected.

### Bundle C: repository tree confirmation
If `qg_bench/cli.py` does not exist, confirm the intended file is instead one of the known CLI candidates evidenced in memory:
- `outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py` (explicitly described as CLI entrypoint)
- `src/cli.py` (present in file list)

---

## What I can responsibly infer as likely “fix targets” (without claiming edits)

Given the mismatch between the mission’s `qg_bench/cli.py` and the evidenced CLI files, the most plausible interpretation (still only a hypothesis) is:

- The syntax error may actually be in **`outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py`** (explicitly “CLI entrypoint”), *or* **`src/cli.py`**, rather than `qg_bench/cli.py`.

Similarly, for experiments:
- The only experiment entrypoint shown is `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow` (item **12**), but the mission says “toy_…”. Without the exact path, we cannot identify the failing file.

I am not asserting this is correct—only that these are the only CLI/experiment-like artifacts grounded in the provided knowledge.

## Conclusion

With the supplied memory items, it is **not possible** to complete the requested workflow (edit specific files, rerun `pytest -q`, rerun a CLI example, and confirm success) in a way that is both **self-contained** and **strictly grounded** in the provided evidence. The knowledge base does not include:

- the contents of `qg_bench/cli.py`,
- the identity/contents of the `src/experiments/toy_...` file,
- any actual syntax error traceback,
- any recorded `pytest -q` run output,
- any recorded CLI example run output (other than the separate `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow` run instruction).

If you provide either the failing `pytest -q` traceback(s) or the contents of the two target files, I can produce precise, line-specific syntax fixes and (separately) outline exactly what `pytest -q` and the CLI run should show after the patch—without inventing results.
