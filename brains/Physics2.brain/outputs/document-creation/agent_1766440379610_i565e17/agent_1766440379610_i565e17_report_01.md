# COSMO Benchmark Suite v0.1 (benchmarks_v0_1.md)

**Date:** 2025-12-22  
**Version:** v0.1  
**Scope constraint:** This spec uses **only** the facts in the provided COSMO “KNOWLEDGE FROM MEMORY” block. In particular, it does **not** assume community-specific normalizations, explicit beta functions beyond the included toy RG memory snippet, or any single program’s preferred definition of “graviton propagator,” “Ward identity,” etc.

## 0. Purpose and known limitation (must be stated up front)

### 0.1 Purpose
Define a small set (3–5) of **machine-checkable** observables with:
- explicit units (or explicitly “dimensionless / normalized”),
- required metadata for reproducibility (hashes/serialization, deterministic I/O),
- pass/fail tolerances designed to expose **scheme / gauge / coarse-graining** sensitivity.

### 0.2 Known limitation (from COSMO memory)
A small, technically chosen set of observables may **not unambiguously discriminate** between competing quantum-gravity proposals because:
- gauge and scheme choices can shift results,
- coarse-graining/regulator choices can shift results,
- the set may miss nonperturbative or background-independent signatures,
- misleading agreement can occur between otherwise incompatible theories.

This suite is therefore defined as a **regression and robustness contract** (what changes when you change gauge/scheme/regulator/coarse-graining), not as a definitive discriminator across all QG programs.

## 1. Common output contract

All benchmarks produce a single JSON artifact (validated by `schema.json`) containing:
- metadata block (reproducibility + provenance),
- a list of observables with values, units, uncertainties,
- a pass/fail section per observable,
- a global summary pass/fail.

### 1.1 Required reproducibility metadata
Because COSMO’s methodology emphasizes end-to-end reproducible artifacts with explicit schemas, reference outputs, deterministic I/O, fixed hashing/serialization, and tolerance policies (guarded by automated tests/CI), every run MUST record:

**Run identity**
- `run_id` (string)
- `timestamp_utc` (RFC3339 string)
- `producer` (tool name/version string)

**Determinism + serialization**
- `serialization` (must specify canonical JSON formatting choice; record a `json_canonical` boolean)
- `artifact_hashes`:
  - `input_hash_sha256`
  - `output_hash_sha256`

**Environment**
- `platform` (OS string)
- `python` (if applicable; version string)
- `dependencies` (free-form list of name/version pairs)

**Model / method provenance**
- `theory_program` (enum-like string; examples grounded in memory themes: `spin_foam_lqg`, `gft`, `causal_set`, `operational_foundations`, `analogue_gravity`, `noise_spectroscopy`)
- `computation_kind` (one of `simulation`, `analysis`, `experiment_like`, `toy_model`)
- `notes` (free-form, required)

**Gauge / scheme / coarse-graining disclosure (required even if “not applicable”)**
- `gauge_choice` (string; can be `"n/a"`)
- `scheme_choice` (string; can be `"n/a"`)
- `regulator` (string; can be `"n/a"`)
- `coarse_graining_level` (string or numeric-as-string; can be `"n/a"`)
- `truncation_description` (string; can be `"n/a"`)

## 2. Benchmarks (v0.1): 5 observables

The suite is intentionally small (v0.1). It covers:  
(1) graviton / 2-pt proxy, (2) curvature/volume scaling exponent,  
(3) effective cosmological constant estimator, (4) diffeo/Ward proxy,  
(5) regulator/truncation sensitivity report.

All tolerances below are defined as **internal-consistency / robustness thresholds** rather than absolute “truth” targets, because COSMO memory does not provide fixed community normalizations or numerical reference values.

---

### Observable O1 — Two-point (2-pt) correlator proxy (“graviton/2-pt proxy”)

**Motivation grounding (from memory):**
- COSMO notes a cross-program push toward **QFT-like observables** (explicitly referenced for causal sets: *entanglement entropy, in-in correlators/scattering*).
- The spec therefore defines a program-agnostic “2-pt proxy” as a reproducible correlator-like summary statistic.

**Definition (v0.1, program-agnostic):**
Report a **normalized** two-point proxy amplitude evaluated on a declared separation grid:
- `k_grid` OR `separation_grid` (must provide one, with units)
- `G2_normalized[i]` values, each dimensionless
- A single scalar summary: `G2_shape_score` (dimensionless), computed by the producer as a reproducible function of the grid values (implementation-specific; recorded in metadata).

**Units:**
- `G2_normalized`: dimensionless
- `k_grid`: `1/length` OR `separation_grid`: `length` (explicitly state length unit, e.g., `m` if applicable; otherwise “model_units” is allowed but must be declared)

**Required metadata fields (in addition to common metadata):**
- `two_point_proxy.definition_text` (string; must describe exactly what is being correlated)
- `two_point_proxy.grid_kind` (`"k_grid"` or `"separation_grid"`)
- `two_point_proxy.grid_units`
- `two_point_proxy.normalization_convention` (string; must be explicit)

**Pass/Fail tolerance (robustness contract):**
Because gauge/scheme/coarse-graining can shift correlators, the benchmark checks **stability** under a declared “paired run” differing only in one technical choice (gauge OR regulator OR truncation):
- Producer MUST provide `paired_comparison` describing the perturbation.
- PASS if `|Δ G2_shape_score| <= 0.10` (dimensionless absolute tolerance)
- FAIL otherwise.

**Rationale for numeric tolerance:** v0.1 uses a coarse 10% stability criterion because COSMO memory provides no program-wide calibration constants; the goal is to detect *large* scheme dependence early.

---

### Observable O2 — Curvature/Volume scaling exponent (scaling diagnostic)

**Motivation grounding (from memory):**
- COSMO highlights **RG/coarse-graining** as a unifying thread (explicitly framed around 2021 cross-approach mappings, e.g. arXiv:2103.14605) and spin-foam/LQG emphasis on **continuum recovery via renormalization/coarse-graining**.
- A minimal cross-approach diagnostic is an empirically fit **scaling exponent** between two aggregated quantities.

**Definition (v0.1):**
Report a fitted power-law exponent `alpha` from a declared relation:
- `curvature_proxy ~ volume_proxy^alpha`
where `curvature_proxy` and `volume_proxy` are **producer-defined** but must be described (textually) and recorded.

**Units:**
- `alpha`: dimensionless
- `curvature_proxy.units`: declared string
- `volume_proxy.units`: declared string

**Required metadata:**
- `scaling_fit.curvature_proxy_definition`
- `scaling_fit.volume_proxy_definition`
- `scaling_fit.fit_method` (string)
- `scaling_fit.fit_domain` (e.g., range over which fit was done; string)
- `scaling_fit.num_points` (integer)

**Pass/Fail tolerance (internal consistency):**
PASS if:
- `alpha_std_err <= 0.05` (dimensionless) AND
- the producer supplies a coarse-graining sweep with at least 2 levels and the fitted exponents satisfy:
  - `max(alpha) - min(alpha) <= 0.10`

FAIL otherwise.

This encodes COSMO’s emphasis that continuum recovery diagnostics must be robust under coarse-graining changes, not just well-fit at one scale.

### Observable O3 — Effective cosmological constant estimator (dimensionless proxy)

**Motivation grounding (from memory):**
- COSMO memory emphasizes bridging microscopic models to emergent semiclassical behavior via RG/coarse-graining. A minimal “emergent large-scale parameter” proxy is an *effective cosmological constant estimator*.
- No numeric target is assumed; we only test **stability and reporting discipline**.

**Definition (v0.1):**
Report `Lambda_eff_hat`, a **dimensionless** estimator, plus `sign` and `estimation_text`.
- If producer has a dimensionful `Λ_eff`, they must also report the conversion used to make it dimensionless (recorded in metadata).

**Units:**
- `Lambda_eff_hat`: dimensionless
- If providing `Lambda_eff_dimensionful`, units must be stated.

**Required metadata:**
- `lambda_estimator.definition_text`
- `lambda_estimator.dimensionless_conversion` (string; may be `"n/a"` if already dimensionless)
- `lambda_estimator.data_source` (`simulation` / `analysis` / `experiment_like` / `toy_model`)

**Pass/Fail tolerance (regulator sensitivity):**
A paired run must vary **regulator OR trunc
