# translation_layer_v0_1.md
Concise translation guide mapping key terms/conputational conventions across communities **only insofar as needed to compute benchmarks** (RG/coarse-graining terms, observables, normalization conventions).

This guide is grounded only in COSMO’s accumulated notes listed in the prompt (no additional assumptions).

## 0) Scope and non-goals

### In-scope (only what’s needed for benchmarks)
- **Renormalization-group (RG) / coarse-graining** language across quantum-gravity communities (as a cross-cutting thread).
- **Continuum/emergence targets** stated in those RG/coarse-graining framings (e.g., semiclassical recovery; effective diffeomorphism symmetry).
- **Observable classes** explicitly mentioned in the notes:  
  - Hawking-like emission / correlations in analogue systems; systematics/backreaction emphasis.  
  - Causal-set QFT observables: entanglement entropy, in-in correlators/scattering.  
  - Decoherence observables: decoherence rates/spectra and scaling with gravitational potential differences; noise power spectral density, filter-function analysis outputs.

### Explicitly out-of-scope (not supported by provided facts)
- Any detailed formulas, beta functions, critical exponents, partition-function normalizations, AdS/CFT dictionary normalizations, LQG/spinfoam amplitude conventions, etc.  
  The provided knowledge states themes and observable *types*, but not shared numeric normalizations.

## 1) Cross-community “RG / coarse-graining” translation map

### 1.1 The shared framing (cross-approach, circa 2021)
**Common statement across programs (translation anchor):**  
Renormalization-group and coarse-graining ideas are presented (notably in 2021 special-issue framing, e.g. arXiv:2103.14605) as a **unifying conceptual + technical thread** across multiple quantum-gravity programs, aiming to relate:
- **microscopic models of spacetime**  
to
- **emergent semiclassical behavior** and **phenomenology**.

**Benchmark implication:**  
When a program says it is doing “RG/coarse-graining,” the benchmark-relevant target is: *does coarse-graining connect a microscopic (discrete / nonperturbative) model to semiclassical/phenomenological outputs?*

---

## 2) Program-specific RG/coarse-graining terms → benchmark meaning

### 2.1 Spin-foam LQG (2018–2025): “background-independent renormalization/coarse-graining”
**Community term(s):**
- “background-independent renormalization/coarse-graining”
- “tensor-network-inspired methods”
- “diagnosing continuum limits”
- “restoring effective diffeomorphism symmetry”

**Translation (benchmark meaning):**
- **Coarse-graining step** = a background-independent transformation intended to probe whether a **continuum limit** exists.
- **Success criterion (as stated in notes)** = progress toward **continuum recovery**, including diagnosing continuum limits and (importantly) **restoring effective diffeomorphism symmetry**.

**Why this matters for benchmarks:**  
Benchmarks that score “continuum recovery” should treat “restoring effective diffeomorphism symmetry” (explicitly mentioned) as a key indicator aligned with the spinfoam coarse-graining agenda.

---

### 2.2 Canonical LQG: foundational variable/representation conventions (context for what “micro” is)
The notes do not state RG/coarse-graining conventions for canonical LQG, but they do anchor canonical LQG’s standard “seminal sequence,” which defines what counts as the microscopic kinematics in that community.

**Community anchors:**
- Ashtekar’s connection variables (1986, *Phys. Rev. Lett.*, DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.57.2244)
- Rovelli & Smolin loop-representation constraint dynamics (1990)
- Ashtekar–Rovelli–Smolin graviton/Fock-space connection (1992)
- Rovelli & Smolin spin-network basis (1995)

**Translation (benchmark meaning):**
- “microscopic model” in canonical LQG contexts typically means dynamics/kinematics built on **connection variables** and **spin-network** states (as the canonical basis milestone).

**Benchmark implication:**  
If a benchmark compares “microscopic → semiclassical,” canonical LQG’s micro-side is naturally expressed in the connection/spin-network language (per the canonical milestone sequence), even though RG language is not specified in the notes for canonical LQG.

### 2.3 String-based quantum gravity (2020–2025): nonperturbative definition emphasis
The notes identify two pillars dominating string-based quantum gravity in this period:
- **Holography**: “sharpest nonperturbative definition where duals exist”
- **Swampland program**: constraints (Weak Gravity, Distance, no-global-symmetries, de Sitter-related conjectures) with syntheses oriented toward cosmology/testing restrictiveness.

**Translation (benchmark meaning):**
- When string-based work is benchmarked for “emergence/nonperturbative control,” the closest provided mapping is:
  - “nonperturbative definition” ↔ **holography where duals exist**
  - “constraint on low-energy effective theory space” ↔ **swampland constraints**

**Important limit:**  
No normalization conventions for observables/dictionaries are given in the notes; only the strategic roles (definition/constraints) are.

---

### 2.4 Causal set theory: dynamics + QFT-on-causal-sets becoming predictive
**Community term(s):**
- “dynamics” improvements (path-integral setting; suppress non-manifold-like causal sets)
- “QFT-on-causal-sets more predictive”
- “QFT observables”: **entanglement entropy**, **in-in correlators/scattering**

**Translation (benchmark meaning):**
- “coarse-graining / emergence” target ↔ **manifold emergence**, operationalized partly by evidence that **non-manifold-like causal sets can be dynamically suppressed** (in a path-integral setting).
- “observable bridge to phenomenology” ↔ computed **entanglement entropy** and **in-in correlators/scattering** on causal sets.

**Benchmark implication:**  
Benchmarks that require an “observable set” for discrete microstructure → phenomenology should treat:
- entanglement entropy
- in-in correlators/scattering  
as the causal-set-side observable outputs explicitly named in the notes.

---

## 3) Observable and measurement conventions: translation across domains

### 3.1 Analogue/emergent gravity experiments: Hawking-like emission and correlations
**Platforms mentioned:** water waves, BECs, optics.  
**Key reference points (as named in notes):**
- Stimulated Hawking emission in water waves (PRL 2011)
- Claims of spontaneous Hawking radiation with correlations in BECs (Nature Physics 2016)
- Ongoing emphasis on **systematics/backreaction beyond fixed-background analogies**, including recent **number-conserving/backreaction** treatments.

**Translation (benchmark meaning):**
- “Hawking-like emission” ↔ analogue signal(s) consistent with Hawking-type mode conversion/emission **in an effective curved background**.
- “correlations” ↔ correlation measurements used to support “spontaneous” Hawking-like claims (explicitly mentioned for BECs, 2016).

**Normalization convention status:**  
The notes do not provide explicit amplitude/correlation-function normalization conventions. Benchmarking must therefore remain at the level of **which observable class** is used (emission vs correlation; stimulated vs spontaneous) and whether **systematics/backreaction** are addressed.

**Empirical-traction note (BECs):**
- Ultracold-atom BEC analogue gravity is described as providing the “most concrete empirical traction.”
- Post-2016 work emphasizes stationarity, time evolution, robustness vs dispersive/finite-temperature effects, reflecting a push for **more falsifiable and metrologically credible tests**.

---

### 3.2 Decoherence / entanglement observables (open-system language)
The notes include a “Cycle 1 consistency review” synthesizing three branches about decoherence and gravity-induced dephasing.

**Shared observable targets across branches:**
- **Decoherence rates**
- **Decoherence spectra**
- **Scaling** with parameters (mass/position/clock energy are mentioned as discriminants)

**Engineering characterization conventions (Branch 1/3-aligned):**
- Noise spectroscopy tools explicitly named: **CPMG**, **spin-echo**, **filter-function analysis**
- Output to extract: **power spectral density** of dephasing
- Controls: **dynamical decoupling** (Uhrig, concatenated, optimized sequences), plus error correction.

**Gravity-induced decoherence signature (Branch 2 claim as summarized):**
- Treated as an intrinsic, position-dependent dephasing channel tied to gravity/time dilation.
- Predicts:
  - dependence on **gravitational potential differences**
  - a specific ordering: superpositions of “when” decohere before those of “where”
- Benchmark experimental design requirement:
  - differential experiments varying gravitational potential difference while holding local environment/engineered noise constant
  - look for residual decoherence not removable by dynamical decoupling/error correction.

**Translation (benchmark meaning):**
- “Decoherence channel” ↔ a noise/dephasing process characterized by a spectral density
