Mission summary: Perform a focused conceptual design and specification for continuum-recovery diagnostics and cross-validation tests for spin-foam/GFT renormalization. Produce a prioritized list of candidate continuum observables, scaling quantities, and mutually comparable metrics (suitable for tensor-network/lattice RG and semiclassical checks), together with a short plan for numerical implementation and benchmark comparisons.
Project: generated_script_1766431640341 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/sf_gft_diagnostics/__init__.py
- Purpose: Package initializer exposing the public API for continuum-recovery diagnostics and cross-validation utilities.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/sf_gft_diagnostics/observables.py: Defines a prioritized catalog of candidate continuum observables, scaling quantities, and comparable metrics with schemas and computable estimators.
- src/sf_gft_diagnostics/scaling.py: Implements scaling analysis utilities (effective exponents, finite-size scaling collapses, hyperscaling checks, and error propagation/bootstraps).
- src/sf_gft_diagnostics/metrics.py: Provides mutually comparable distance/consistency metrics for RG flows and semiclassical benchmarks (e.g., Wasserstein/JS on distributions, KL surrogates, and curve/trajectory distances).
- src/sf_gft_diagnostics/rg_io.py: Implements lightweight loaders/adapters for tensor-network/lattice RG outputs and GFT/spinfoam coarse-graining logs into a unified in-memory dataset format.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Package initializer exposing the public API for continuum-recovery diagnostics and cross-validation utilities.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/sf_gft_diagnostics/__init__.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/sf_gft_diagnostics/__init__.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/sf_gft_diagnostics/__init__.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
