Mission summary: Add a deterministic-run policy and numeric tolerance harness integrated with the existing expected-vs-actual comparison: enforce fixed RNG seeds, stable serialization ordering, and tolerance-based numeric diffs when comparing outputs to `expected/benchmark_case_001.expected.json`; ensure CI uses the same settings.
Project: generated_script_1766440250541 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/determinism.py
- Purpose: Implements a deterministic-run policy that sets and validates fixed RNG seeds across Python/random, NumPy, and any supported frameworks and provides context managers to enforce determinism during benchmark runs.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/stable_json.py: Provides stable JSON serialization utilities (canonical key ordering, normalized floats, consistent indentation/newlines) to ensure byte-for-byte reproducible output files across machines and CI.
- src/numeric_tolerance_diff.py: Implements a numeric-tolerance comparison engine for expected-vs-actual JSON that supports absolute/relative tolerances, per-path overrides, NaN/inf handling, and produces a structured diff report.
- src/benchmark_compare.py: Integrates deterministic policy, stable serialization, and tolerance-based numeric diffs into the existing expected-vs-actual comparison against expected/benchmark_case_001.expected.json and returns CI-friendly exit codes and reports.
- scripts/run_benchmark_case_001.py: End-to-end runner script that executes benchmark_case_001 with fixed seed/settings, writes canonicalized actual output, and invokes the integrated comparator against the expected JSON.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Implements a deterministic-run policy that sets and validates fixed RNG seeds across Python/random, NumPy, and any supported frameworks and provides context managers to enforce determinism during benchmark runs.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/determinism.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/determinism.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/determinism.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
