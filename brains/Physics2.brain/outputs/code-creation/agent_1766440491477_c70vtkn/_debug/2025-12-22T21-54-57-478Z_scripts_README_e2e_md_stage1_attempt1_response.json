By default it writes a run directory:\n\n- `artifacts/e2e/<run_id>/`\n  - `e2e.log` (combined stdout/stderr)\n  - `summary.json` (structured stage results: status, timings, exit codes)\n  - `manifest.json` (deterministic list of produced files + checksums)\n  - `failure_summary.md` (human-readable failure report when something fails)\n  - `logs/` (per-stage logs, when available)\n  - `results/` (pipeline outputs, when available)\n\nYou can control where artifacts go:\n```bash\nARTIFACT_DIR=artifacts/e2e make e2e\n```\n\n## CI usage (GitHub Actions)\n\nThe workflow `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` runs **exactly the same command**:\n```yaml\n- run: make e2e\n```\n\n### Artifact upload\nThe workflow uploads the full run directory (e.g. `artifacts/e2e/<run_id>/`) using `actions/upload-artifact`.\nThis makes failures debuggable without rerunning locally; download the artifact and inspect `failure_summary.md`,\n`summary.json`, and `e2e.log`.\n\n### Exit behavior\n- If all stages succeed: `make e2e` exits `0`.\n- If any stage fails: `make e2e` exits non-zero and still writes artifacts/logs up to the point of failure.\n\n## How logging and artifacts are produced\n\n- `scripts/e2e.py` runs each pipeline stage as a subprocess, capturing **stdout/stderr**, exit code, and duration.\n- Logs are written both as:\n  - a consolidated `e2e.log`\n  - per-stage logs under `logs/`\n- `scripts/artifacts.py` produces:\n  - a deterministic `manifest.json` so runs can be compared\n  - optional redaction of common secrets before packaging/upload (e.g. tokens in env/output)\n\n## Automatic failure issue creation (and deduplication)\n\nIn CI, when `make e2e` fails, the workflow triggers issue creation using the generated `failure_summary.md`\nand `summary.json`:\n\n- **Minimal reproduction steps** are included (exact `make e2e` command + relevant env vars and stage name).\n- The workflow computes a **dedupe key** from:\n  - failing stage name\n  - exit code / error class (when available)\n  - a stable hash of the first N lines of the failing stage's stderr (post-redaction)\n- Before creating a new issue, the workflow searches existing open issues for the same dedupe key.\n  - If found: it adds a comment with the new run link and artifact name.\n  - If not found: it opens a new issue titled like `E2E failure: <stage> (<dedupe_key>)` and attaches the summary.\n\n### Permissions/requirements\n- The workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `issues: write` permission.\n- Issue bodies reference the Actions run URL and the uploaded artifact name for quick access.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- CI failed but artifacts are missing: ensure the workflow uploads artifacts on failure (use `if: always()`).\n- Local debugging: open `artifacts/e2e/<run_id>/failure_summary.md` and rerun the failing stage with the\n  same environment variables shown there.\n\"\"\"\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/README_e2e.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))",
