You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add a single command (e.g., `make e2e` or GitHub Actions workflow) that runs the full pipeline and uploads logs/artifacts; open issues for each failure with minimal reproduction steps.
Project: generated_script_1766440495852 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/repro_steps.py
- Purpose: Generates minimal reproduction commands and environment details from pipeline context and failing stage metadata.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- Makefile: Defines a single end-to-end command (make e2e) that runs the full pipeline, captures logs, and prepares artifacts for upload in CI.
- .github/workflows/e2e.yml: GitHub Actions workflow that runs the full pipeline via make e2e, uploads logs/artifacts, and triggers automatic issue creation on failures.
- scripts/e2e.py: Python orchestrator that runs all pipeline stages, captures stdout/stderr and timing, writes structured logs/artifacts, and emits a failure summary for CI.
- scripts/artifacts.py: Artifact utilities to package logs/results (e.g., tar/zip), redact secrets, and produce a deterministic artifact manifest for upload and debugging.

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Generates minimal reproduction commands and environment details from pipeline context and failing stage metadata.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/repro_steps.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/repro_steps.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/repro_steps.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
