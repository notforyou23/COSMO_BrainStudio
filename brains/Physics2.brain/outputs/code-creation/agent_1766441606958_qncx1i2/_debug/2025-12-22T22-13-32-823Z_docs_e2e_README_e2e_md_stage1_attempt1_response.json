Checkout repository\n2. **Common setup** via `e2e-common`:\n   - environment normalization (shell, paths, locale/timezone if needed)\n   - dependency caching\n   - install Python deps (including `docs/e2e/requirements-ci.txt` where applicable)\n3. Run the E2E command\n4. On failure, **triage** via `e2e-on-failure`:\n   - collect diagnostics\n   - bundle logs\n   - upload artifacts\n   - write a concise GitHub Actions job summary\n\n## Failure triage: what gets captured and how to use it\n\nWhen an E2E run fails, the CI job captures evidence to make failures actionable:\n\n- **Artifacts**: uploaded bundles of logs and other runtime outputs\n- **Console logs**: full job output for quick scanning\n- **Step summary**: short “what failed / where to look” notes\n\n### How to debug from CI artifacts\n\n1. Open the failing workflow run in GitHub Actions.\n2. Download uploaded artifacts from the run.\n3. Inspect:\n   - primary test runner output (often the fastest signal)\n   - per-test logs/traces (if produced)\n   - environment info captured during setup (versions, paths)\n\n### Common failure classes\n\n- Dependency drift: pinning mismatches or missing CI-only deps (check `docs/e2e/requirements-ci.txt`)\n- Environment differences: OS / PATH / locale / permissions differences between local and runner\n- Flaky external dependencies: network calls, rate limits, ephemeral services\n- Timing issues: add retries/awaits at the right layer (test code vs system under test)\n\n## Workflow modularization (why composite actions)\n\nThe E2E workflow is split into composite actions to reduce duplication and to keep behavior consistent:\n\n- **`e2e-common`**: everything that should be identical across all E2E workflows\n  (setup, caching, dependency installation, normalized environment).\n- **`e2e-on-failure`**: everything that should only run when something fails\n  (diagnostics, artifact upload, summaries).\n\nThis structure makes it easier to:\n- update E2E infrastructure once and reuse it everywhere\n- review changes (setup vs diagnostics vs test execution are clearly separated)\n- add new E2E workflows without copy/paste\n\n## Making changes safely\n\nIf you change E2E dependencies or the runtime environment:\n\n- Update `docs/e2e/requirements-ci.txt` when CI-only packages are added/removed/pinned.\n- Prefer changing shared behavior inside the composite actions so all workflows stay consistent.\n- Validate by running locally (if possible) and then confirming CI produces the expected artifacts on failure.\n\n## Quick links\n\n- Workflow: `.github/workflows/e2e_failure.yml`\n- Composite actions:\n  - `.github/actions/e2e-common/action.yml`\n  - `.github/actions/e2e-on-failure/action.yml`\n- CI requirements: `docs/e2e/requirements-ci.txt`\n\"\"\")\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\n# Ensure line budget <= 150 lines\nline_count = final_text.count('\\n')\nassert line_count <= 150, line_count\n\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:docs/e2e/README_e2e.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))",
