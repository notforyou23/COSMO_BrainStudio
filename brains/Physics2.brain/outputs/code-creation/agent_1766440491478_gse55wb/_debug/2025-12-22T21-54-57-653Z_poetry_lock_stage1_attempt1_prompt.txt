You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Pin dependencies (lockfile), add container or uv/poetry config, record Python/version metadata in benchmark outputs, and tag a reproducible release (v0.1.0) once CI is green.
Project: generated_configuration_1766440496320 (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: poetry.lock
- Purpose: Pins all transitive dependency versions and hashes to ensure fully reproducible installs across environments and CI runs.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- Dockerfile: Defines a reproducible container image that installs pinned Python dependencies from a lockfile and runs the project deterministically in CI and locally.
- .dockerignore: Excludes caches, virtual environments, build artifacts, and large/unnecessary files from the Docker build context to keep images reproducible and small.
- pyproject.toml: Declares the project metadata, Python version constraints, dependencies, and tooling configuration using Poetry for reproducible builds.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: Runs lint/test/benchmark reproducibility checks using both host Python and the Docker image to gate the v0.1.0 release on green CI.

Key requirements:
- docker

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pins all transitive dependency versions and hashes to ensure fully reproducible installs across environments and CI runs.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('poetry.lock')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:poetry.lock')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside poetry.lock.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
