You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Fix blocking syntax errors preventing execution in the already-created deliverables: `qg_bench/cli.py` (reported syntax_error), `src/cosmo_contracts/markdown.py` (reported syntax_error), and any additional syntax errors encountered during the urgent end-to-end run; add/adjust minimal tests to prevent regression.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766440251333 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_cli_smoke.py
- Purpose: Minimal CLI smoke test that executes the qg_bench CLI help/version path to confirm end-to-end invocation works without errors.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- qg_bench/cli.py: Fix and provide a runnable CLI entry module for qg_bench with corrected syntax and minimal, robust argument parsing.
- src/cosmo_contracts/markdown.py: Fix and provide a valid markdown utility module with corrected syntax and stable public helpers used by the package.
- tests/test_syntax_imports.py: Regression tests that import the previously failing modules to ensure no SyntaxError or import-time crashes occur.

Reference insights:
- [CONSOLIDATED] Across multiple agent runs, automated file validation generally succeeds with most files passing, but occasional syntax error

- [INTROSPECTION] 2025-12-22T20-29-38-112Z_tools_output_format_policy_py_stage1_attempt1_prompt.txt from code-creation agent agent_17664353696

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Minimal CLI smoke test that executes the qg_bench CLI help/version path to confirm end-to-end invocation works without errors.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_cli_smoke.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_cli_smoke.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_cli_smoke.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
