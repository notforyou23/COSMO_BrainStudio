Mission summary: Implement a single determinism policy module (seed setting + stable JSON serialization) and a numeric diff utility (absolute/relative tolerances) and wire it into the benchmark runner so `benchmark_case_001` comparisons are tolerance-aware and repeatable.
Project: generated_library_1766440316966 (json library)

Target file details:
- Path: benchmarks/benchmark_runner.py
- Purpose: Wires determinism policy and tolerance-aware numeric diff into the benchmark runner so benchmark_case_001 results are repeatable and comparisons respect configured tolerances.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/determinism_policy.py: Implements the single determinism policy (seed setting across Python/random/NumPy if available + environment normalization) and exposes a small API used by the benchmark runner.
- src/stable_json.py: Provides stable, deterministic JSON serialization utilities (canonical key ordering, normalized floats, consistent formatting) used for repeatable benchmark artifacts and comparisons.
- src/numeric_diff.py: Implements a numeric diff utility supporting absolute/relative tolerances and recursive comparison over JSON-like structures with clear mismatch reporting.
- benchmarks/cases/benchmark_case_001.py: Defines benchmark_case_001 and its expected/actual result production in a way that integrates with the runner’s determinism and tolerance-aware comparison pipeline.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Wires determinism policy and tolerance-aware numeric diff into the benchmark runner so benchmark_case_001 results are repeatable and comparisons respect configured tolerances.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('benchmarks/benchmark_runner.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:benchmarks/benchmark_runner.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside benchmarks/benchmark_runner.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
