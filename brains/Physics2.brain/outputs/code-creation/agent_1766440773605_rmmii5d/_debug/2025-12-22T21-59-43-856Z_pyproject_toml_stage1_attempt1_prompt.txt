You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add a GitHub Actions workflow running (a) lint/compile, (b) schema validation for examples, (c) `pytest`, and (d) benchmark reproduction check; ensure artifacts (logs/diffs) are uploaded on failure.
Project: generated_script_1766440781994 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: pyproject.toml
- Purpose: Project configuration for toolchain (ruff/black/pytest) and dependency extras required by CI linting, schema validation, and benchmarking scripts.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs lint/compile, validates example schemas, executes pytest, and performs a benchmark reproduction check with failure artifacts uploaded.
- scripts/ci_lint_compile.py: Python CI helper that performs formatting/lint checks and a compilation pass (AST/bytecode import) and writes detailed logs for artifact upload on failure.
- scripts/validate_examples_schema.py: Python script that validates repository example files against the project JSON Schema and emits a diff-like report for any violations.
- scripts/bench_repro_check.py: Python script that re-runs benchmarks in a controlled way, compares results to a committed baseline within tolerances, and writes a human-readable diff plus machine-readable JSON.

Key requirements:
- examples

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Project configuration for toolchain (ruff/black/pytest) and dependency extras required by CI linting, schema validation, and benchmarking scripts.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('pyproject.toml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:pyproject.toml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside pyproject.toml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
