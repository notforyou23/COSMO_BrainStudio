Mission summary: Define a single deterministic policy (seed handling + float formatting + JSON key ordering) and implement it in the runner and comparator; add a pytest that runs the same benchmark twice and asserts byte-identical (or tolerance-identical) results.
Project: generated_script_1766440777503 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/benchmark_determinism.py
- Purpose: Defines a single deterministic policy (seed setting across common RNGs and canonical JSON serialization with stable key ordering and float formatting) used by both runner and comparator.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/benchmark_runner.py: Implements benchmark execution using the shared deterministic policy to ensure repeated runs produce byte-identical canonical JSON outputs.
- src/benchmark_compare.py: Implements benchmark result comparison using the same canonicalization rules (and optional numeric tolerance) so comparisons are stable and reproducible.
- tests/test_benchmark_determinism.py: Pytest that runs the same benchmark twice and asserts results are byte-identical (or tolerance-identical) under the deterministic policy.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines a single deterministic policy (seed setting across common RNGs and canonical JSON serialization with stable key ordering and float formatting) used by both runner and comparator.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/benchmark_determinism.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/benchmark_determinism.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/benchmark_determinism.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
