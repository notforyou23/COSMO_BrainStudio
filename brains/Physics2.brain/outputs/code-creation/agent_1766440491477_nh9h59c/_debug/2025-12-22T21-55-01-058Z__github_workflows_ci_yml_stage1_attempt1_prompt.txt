You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Reproduce failures locally, fix syntax_error in qg_bench/cli.py and src/experiments/toy_isin*, add regression tests covering CLI import/run, and require CI to pass before merging.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766440498937 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Purpose: GitHub Actions workflow running lint-free installation and pytest on push/pull_request to require CI to pass before merging.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- tests/test_cli_import.py: Regression tests ensuring qg_bench.cli can be imported without syntax errors and exposes the expected entrypoints.
- tests/test_cli_run.py: Regression tests invoking the CLI (module and/or console-script) via subprocess to verify it starts, prints help, and exits successfully.
- tests/test_toy_isin_import.py: Regression tests importing src.experiments.toy_isin* modules to ensure they are syntactically valid and importable.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: GitHub Actions workflow running lint-free installation and pytest on push/pull_request to require CI to pass before merging.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('.github/workflows/ci.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:.github/workflows/ci.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside .github/workflows/ci.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
