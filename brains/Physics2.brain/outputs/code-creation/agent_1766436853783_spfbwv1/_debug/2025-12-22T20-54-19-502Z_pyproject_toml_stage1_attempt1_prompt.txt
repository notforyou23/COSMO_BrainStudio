Mission summary: Develop an integrated theoretical-to-experimental pipeline connecting discrete-gravity microstructure (causal sets, discrete spectra) to measurable signatures in analogue platforms and astrophysical probes. Produce a prioritized set of concrete measurement protocols for correlators and entanglement diagnostics, a plan for controlled numerical/analytical simulations quantifying finite-size and dispersive systematics, and a statistical-inference strategy to translate measured data into constraints on discrete-structure parameters.
Project: generated_script_1766436857027 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: pyproject.toml
- Purpose: Defines the Python package metadata, dependencies, CLI entrypoint, formatting/linting tool settings, and pytest configuration for a reproducible pipeline.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: Runs continuous integration on pushes and pull requests including linting, unit tests, and minimal smoke execution of the CLI pipeline.
- .github/workflows/cd.yml: Implements continuous delivery by building and publishing a versioned Python package artifact (and optionally a GitHub Release) on tagged commits.
- README.md: Documents the mission, scientific scope, installation, CLI usage examples, data-model conventions, and how to run simulations and inference end-to-end.
- src/dgpipe/__init__.py: Initializes the dgpipe package, exposes the public API surface, and centralizes version information.

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines the Python package metadata, dependencies, CLI entrypoint, formatting/linting tool settings, and pytest configuration for a reproducible pipeline.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('pyproject.toml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:pyproject.toml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside pyproject.toml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
