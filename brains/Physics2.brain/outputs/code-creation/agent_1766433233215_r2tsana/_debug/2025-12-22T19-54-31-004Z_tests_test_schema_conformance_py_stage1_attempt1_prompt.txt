You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add `pytest` tests and GitHub Actions to (i) validate all example inputs against schema, (ii) run the reference implementation on `benchmark_case_001`, (iii) compare produced outputs to expected within tolerance, and (iv) upload outputs as CI artifacts for inspection.
Project: generated_script_1766433269260 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_schema_conformance.py
- Purpose: Pytest suite that validates all example JSON inputs under the examples directory against the benchmark input JSON Schema using jsonschema.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: GitHub Actions workflow that installs dependencies, runs pytest, executes the benchmark_case_001 reference run, compares outputs to expected within tolerance, and uploads produced outputs as CI artifacts.
- tests/test_benchmark_case_001.py: Pytest suite that runs the reference implementation on benchmark_case_001, writes outputs to a deterministic location, and compares them to expected outputs within numeric tolerances.
- tests/conftest.py: Pytest fixtures for locating repository paths, loading JSON examples/expected files, configuring tolerances, and defining the output directory used by CI and local runs.
- tests/utils_compare.py: Test helper utilities to recursively compare nested JSON-like structures with configurable absolute/relative tolerances and clear diff reporting for assertion failures.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pytest suite that validates all example JSON inputs under the examples directory against the benchmark input JSON Schema using jsonschema.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_schema_conformance.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_schema_conformance.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_schema_conformance.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
