Mission summary: Refactor and modularize reusable code artifacts: 2025-12-22T22-13-32-823Z__github_actions_e2e-on-failure_action_yml_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt, action.yml, e2e_failure.yml, 2025-12-22T22-13-32-823Z__github_workflows_e2e_failure_yml_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt, 2025-12-22T22-13-32-823Z_docs_e2e_README_e2e_md_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt
Project: generated_script_1766442182225 (yaml script)

Target file details:
- Path: .github/actions/e2e-on-failure/action.yml
- Purpose: Composite GitHub Action definition refactored into modular steps to collect and upload E2E diagnostics only when a prior step/job fails.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- .github/workflows/e2e_failure.yml: Reusable workflow that invokes the e2e-on-failure composite action and standardizes failure-handling diagnostics across E2E jobs.
- scripts/e2e/collect_diagnostics.sh: Reusable bash script that gathers logs, screenshots, videos, test reports, and environment metadata into a single diagnostics directory for upload.
- scripts/e2e/validate_config.py: Python validator that checks required inputs and environment assumptions for E2E failure collection, emitting actionable errors for CI.
- docs/e2e/README_e2e.md: Documentation describing how the E2E failure workflow and action work, required inputs, artifact layout, and local/CI usage examples.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Composite GitHub Action definition refactored into modular steps to collect and upload E2E diagnostics only when a prior step/job fails.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('.github/actions/e2e-on-failure/action.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:.github/actions/e2e-on-failure/action.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside .github/actions/e2e-on-failure/action.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
