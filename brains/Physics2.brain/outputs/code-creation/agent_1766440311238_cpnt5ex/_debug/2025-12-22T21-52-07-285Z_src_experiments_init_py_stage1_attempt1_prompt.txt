Mission summary: BLOCKED TASK: "Implement prototype numerical / symbolic experiments that illustrate the behavior or consequences of" failed because agents produced no output. Definition-of-Done failed: Field missing. Investigate and resolve blocking issues before retrying.
Project: generated_script_1766440325922 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/experiments/__init__.py
- Purpose: Experiment package initializer exposing the registry of available numerical and symbolic experiment routines.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- README.md: Project overview and quickstart instructions for running prototype numerical/symbolic experiments and generating figures/tables.
- examples/expected_outputs.md: Concrete examples of command invocations with expected stdout summaries and generated artifact filenames to satisfy Definition-of-Done expectations.
- pyproject.toml: Python project configuration including minimal dependencies, entry points, and formatting/linting defaults.
- requirements.txt: Pinned runtime dependencies for numerical and symbolic computations and optional plotting support.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Experiment package initializer exposing the registry of available numerical and symbolic experiment routines.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/experiments/__init__.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/experiments/__init__.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/experiments/__init__.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
