It should remain stable and broadly applicable across workflows (local runs and CI).\n\"\"\")\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:docs/e2e/README_e2e_sections/00_overview.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))",
