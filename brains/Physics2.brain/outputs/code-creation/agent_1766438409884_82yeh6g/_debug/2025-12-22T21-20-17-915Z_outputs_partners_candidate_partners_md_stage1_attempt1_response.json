It is intentionally lightweight: partner names, what they bring, and a suggested first engagement step.\n\n## Partner selection criteria (used for shortlist)\n- **Strategic fit:** alignment with project scope and near-term milestones.\n- **Capability:** proven delivery in the relevant domain (tech, data, policy, evaluation).\n- **Speed to start:** availability of standard agreements, pilots, or existing programs.\n- **Risk profile:** manageable legal/security/compliance posture; clear IP terms.\n- **Leverage:** ability to unlock additional networks, funding, or distribution.\n\n## Candidate partner shortlist (with collaboration recommendations)\n\n### 1) Cloud & infrastructure\n- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** — Scalable hosting, managed data services, security tooling.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** startup/innovation credits + architecture review; ensure well-defined data residency and logging requirements.\n- **Microsoft Azure** — Enterprise integration, governance tooling, strong identity/IAM patterns.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** credits + security baseline review; evaluate compatibility with existing Microsoft 365 tenant policies.\n- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** — Data/ML primitives, analytics stack.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** credits + joint PoC for data pipeline and reproducible ML workflow.\n\n### 2) Identity, security, and compliance support\n- **Okta** — SSO/MFA and access governance for internal tools and partner portals.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** limited-scope integration pilot; establish role model and least-privilege access patterns.\n- **Cloudflare** — Edge security, WAF, DDoS protection, performance.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** front-door protection for public endpoints; define incident response SLAs and logging retention.\n\n### 3) Open-source foundations & standards bodies\n- **Linux Foundation (and relevant hosted projects)** — Neutral governance, community processes, long-term sustainability.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** join as member or engage for best practices; evaluate if project should align to an existing LF umbrella.\n- **W3C / IETF working groups (as applicable)** — Standards guidance and interoperability patterns.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** observer participation; map roadmap items to existing standards and avoid reinventing protocols.\n\n### 4) Academic and research collaborators\n- **MIT (relevant labs/centers)** — Rigorous methods, evaluation design, and research-to-product translation.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** short research sprints; co-author evaluation plan and publish non-sensitive findings.\n- **Stanford (relevant labs/centers)** — HCI/AI expertise, responsible deployment frameworks.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** advisory relationship + study design review; establish ethics/IRB consultation path if needed.\n- **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)** — Applied engineering and security/usable privacy strengths.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** targeted collaboration on security and threat modeling; conduct independent review.\n\n### 5) Data & benchmarking sources\n- **World Bank (open data initiatives)** — High-quality global indicators and documentation.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** data alignment + citation protocol; ensure consistent versioning of datasets for auditability.\n- **OECD (data and policy artifacts)** — Comparative policy datasets and analytics.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** map policy taxonomy to project domain; establish reproducible data ingestion workflow.\n- **Kaggle (public datasets/benchmarks)** — Rapid prototyping datasets and baseline comparisons.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** use only for non-sensitive experimentation; document licensing and dataset provenance.\n\n### 6) Responsible tech & governance organizations\n- **Partnership on AI (PAI)** — Responsible AI best practices and peer learning.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** adopt relevant frameworks; use working groups to pressure-test governance.\n- **IEEE (ethics and standards initiatives)** — Engineering-aligned governance and standards references.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** align documentation with IEEE guidance; identify applicable standard checklists.\n\n### 7) Implementation & delivery partners (consulting / integrators)\n- **Thoughtworks** — Lean delivery, platform modernization, and strong engineering practices.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** time-boxed discovery + delivery blueprint; require measurable outcomes and handover plan.\n- **Accenture** — Large-scale implementation capacity and enterprise change management.  \n  **Recommended collaboration:** use for integration-heavy phases; negotiate clear IP, data handling, and exit clauses.\n\n## Recommended engagement model (low-risk, high-signal)\n1. **Intro + scope alignment (1–2 weeks):** share non-sensitive requirements and constraints; collect capability statements.\n2. **Pilot/PoC (2–6 weeks):** small deliverable with explicit success metrics, security requirements, and documentation outputs.\n3. **Scale decision:** extend to longer contract/MoU only after pilot results and governance review.\n\n## Due diligence checklist (minimum)\n- Confirm **data handling** (storage location, retention, access logging, subprocessors).\n- Confirm **IP and licensing** terms for deliverables and dependencies.\n- Confirm **security posture** (SOC2/ISO, vulnerability disclosure, incident response).\n- Confirm **financials** (rate card, credits, non-profit discounts) and **exit strategy** (handover artifacts).\n\n## Immediate next steps (internal)\n- Select **3 priority partners** (1 infra, 1 research/evaluation, 1 governance) and schedule intro calls.\n- Prepare a one-page **Partner Brief**: problem statement, constraints, timeline, success metrics, and contact roles.\n- Record decisions in the audit log (date, rationale, and selected collaboration model).\"\"\"\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/partners/candidate_partners.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))\n",
