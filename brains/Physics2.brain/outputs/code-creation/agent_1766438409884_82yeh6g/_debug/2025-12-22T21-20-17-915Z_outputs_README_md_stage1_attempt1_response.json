Audits expect files to exist **on disk** under `outputs/` with predictable names and minimal, self-describing metadata.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## What belongs in `outputs/`\n\nStore finalized artifacts that reviewers should verify without re-running code, including:\n\n- Documents: `*.md`, `*.pdf`, `*.html`\n- Data exports: `*.csv`, `*.json`, `*.parquet` (keep sizes reasonable)\n- Figures: `*.png`, `*.svg`\n- Model/run metadata: `*.json`, `*.txt` logs (sanitized; no secrets)\n\nDo **not** store: secrets, API keys, raw credentials, or large ephemeral caches.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Recommended layout\n\nUse subfolders to keep audits predictable:\n\n- `outputs/reports/` — narrative deliverables (status reports, summaries)\n- `outputs/data/` — exported datasets and tables\n- `outputs/figures/` — images/plots used in reports\n- `outputs/logs/` — run logs and provenance notes\n- `outputs/manifests/` — machine-readable indexes of deliverables\n\nThis repository may add more subfolders, but keep the intent obvious and consistent.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Naming conventions (strict)\n\nPrefer deterministic, sortable, and greppable names:\n\n- Use **lowercase** and **kebab-case** (`my-report.md`)\n- Avoid spaces; avoid special characters besides `-` and `_`\n- Include a **date** when the artifact is time-specific: `YYYY-MM-DD`\n- Include a **version tag** when multiple revisions exist: `v1`, `v2`, `v1.1`\n- Include a short **scope/topic** label\n\nExamples:\n- `reports/2025-12-22-audit-summary-v1.md`\n- `data/2025-12-22-metrics-export-v2.csv`\n- `figures/2025-12-22-latency-histogram-v1.png`\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Minimum metadata requirements\n\nEvery deliverable should be self-describing:\n\n- **Human-readable docs** (`.md/.pdf/.html`) must state on the first page:\n  - purpose and scope\n  - generation method (manual vs. script; script path if applicable)\n  - inputs used (source files/parameters) and any assumptions\n  - author/owner (team or role) and creation date\n- **Data files** should have either:\n  - a companion `*.md` or `*.json` with schema + provenance, or\n  - a header row plus a short `README.md` in the same folder describing columns.\n- **Figures** should include a caption either embedded in a report or in a companion\n  `*.md` stating what the plot shows and what data it is based on.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Audit expectations (what reviewers check)\n\nAuditors typically verify:\n\n1. **File existence** under `outputs/` (not just described in chat or code)\n2. **Reproducibility hints** (how it was produced; inputs and parameters)\n3. **Consistency** between filenames, dates, and described versions\n4. **No sensitive content**\n5. **Completeness**: key deliverables are present (reports + supporting artifacts)\n\nIf an audit states “0 files created”, it means nothing tangible was written to disk;\nensure deliverables are committed/generated into this folder.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## How to add a deliverable\n\n1. Choose the correct subfolder (`reports/`, `data/`, `figures/`, `logs/`).\n2. Name the file following the convention above.\n3. Include the minimum metadata (in-file or companion file).\n4. If the deliverable is generated, ensure the generating script writes to `outputs/`.\n5. Re-run the workflow and confirm the file exists locally before submission.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Quick checklist before submission\n\n- [ ] Deliverable file is in `outputs/` and opens correctly\n- [ ] Filename matches convention (date/topic/version)\n- [ ] Metadata/provenance included\n- [ ] No secrets or private data\n- [ ] Supporting artifacts (data/figures) referenced by reports are present\"\"\",\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/README.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))\n",
