This repository is a **versioned skeleton** intended to make audit deliverables reproducible and easy to review.\n\n## Quick start\n1. Create a branch from `main`.\n2. Make focused commits.\n3. Open a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description and links to evidence.\n4. Ensure outputs and docs follow the structure below.\n\n## Workflow\n- Use GitHub PRs for all changes (no direct pushes to `main`).\n- Keep PRs small and scoped to one objective (e.g., “add Stage 1 outputs skeleton”).\n- Prefer deterministic generation: if a script produces files, commit the script and the generated artifacts that are required for audit.\n\n## Branching\n- Base branch: `main`\n- Branch naming:\n  - `feat/<short-topic>` (new capability/content)\n  - `fix/<short-topic>` (bugfix)\n  - `docs/<short-topic>` (documentation-only)\n  - `chore/<short-topic>` (maintenance)\n- Rebase/merge policy: keep a clean history; squash merge is acceptable if it preserves an informative PR description.\n\n## Commit messages\nUse imperative, descriptive messages:\n- Good: `Add repository skeleton to outputs/`\n- Good: `Document deliverables layout and naming rules`\n- Avoid: `update`, `changes`, `misc`\n\n## Repository structure (expected)\n- `README.md` — project overview and how to (re)generate the skeleton\n- `LICENSE` — open-source license text\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — this file\n- `docs/` — documentation hub and pages\n- `outputs/` — audit deliverables and generated artifacts\n  - `.gitkeep` (or similar) may be used to ensure the directory is tracked\n\nKeep additions consistent with this layout; if you introduce a new top-level directory, justify it in the PR.\n\n## Adding deliverables to `outputs/`\nDeliverables should be easy to locate, diff, and review.\n\n### Naming and organization\n- Use stable, human-readable names (no timestamps in filenames unless required by the artifact).\n- Group by stage and artifact type when applicable, for example:\n  - `outputs/stage-1/`\n  - `outputs/stage-1/reports/`\n  - `outputs/stage-1/data/`\n- Prefer lowercase with hyphens for folders and files: `stage-1`, `audit-summary.md`.\n\n### What to commit\n- Commit final deliverables (the files an auditor/reviewer must see).\n- If deliverables are generated, also commit the generator script and document how to run it.\n- Do not commit secrets, credentials, API keys, or private data.\n\n### Formatting and quality\n- Text artifacts: UTF-8, LF line endings.\n- Markdown: wrap lines sensibly (~80–120 chars where practical), use headings in logical order.\n- Data artifacts: include a short `README.md` in the containing folder explaining provenance and schema when non-obvious.\n- Binary files: only include when necessary; prefer PDF/PNG over proprietary formats when possible, and document how they were produced.\n\n## Documentation conventions\n- Put long-form documentation in `docs/`.\n- Cross-link from `README.md` to the relevant `docs/` entry points.\n- When adding a doc page, include:\n  - Purpose/summary\n  - Inputs/assumptions\n  - Outputs (with paths under `outputs/` when relevant)\n  - Reproduction steps (commands and expected results)\n\n## Reviews and acceptance criteria\nA change is ready to merge when:\n- The diff is complete and understandable without external context.\n- Paths and filenames match the repository structure rules above.\n- New/changed outputs are documented (what they are and how to reproduce them).\n- No sensitive information is introduced.\n- CI/checks (if present) pass.\n\n## Reporting issues\nUse Issues for:\n- Missing deliverables or unclear locations\n- Broken generation steps\n- Naming/layout inconsistencies\nInclude exact paths and, when possible, minimal reproduction steps.\n\"\"\"\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:CONTRIBUTING.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))\n",
