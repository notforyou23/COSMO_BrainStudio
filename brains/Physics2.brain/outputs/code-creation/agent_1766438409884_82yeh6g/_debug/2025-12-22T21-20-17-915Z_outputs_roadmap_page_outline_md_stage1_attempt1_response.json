Each page lists the intended sections and the type of content expected so future contributors can fill in details consistently.\n\n## Page 1 — Executive Summary\n- **Purpose and audience:** Who this roadmap serves and what decisions it enables.\n- **One-paragraph strategy:** The guiding approach, assumptions, and constraints.\n- **Top outcomes (3–5 bullets):** Measurable end-state results.\n- **At-a-glance timeline:** Quarter-by-quarter or phase summary in a single view.\n- **Call to action:** What stakeholders should review/approve next.\n\n## Page 2 — Vision, Principles, and Scope\n- **Vision statement:** What “success” looks like when the roadmap is delivered.\n- **Operating principles:** The non-negotiables that shape choices and tradeoffs.\n- **In scope:** Capabilities, markets, platforms, and teams covered.\n- **Out of scope:** Explicit exclusions to prevent roadmap creep.\n- **Decision log (summary):** The key scope-setting decisions that anchor the plan.\n\n## Page 3 — Current State & Baseline\n- **Baseline metrics:** Current performance, cost, reliability, or adoption levels.\n- **Capability inventory:** What exists today (systems, processes, skills).\n- **Pain points:** Primary user and operational issues with evidence.\n- **Constraints:** Budget, compliance, legacy dependencies, staffing realities.\n- **Baseline risks:** Known technical or organizational factors affecting delivery.\n\n## Page 4 — Users, Stakeholders, and Needs\n- **Personas / segments:** Who benefits, who operates, and who approves.\n- **Jobs-to-be-done:** Core user goals and how they measure success.\n- **Stakeholder map:** Influence, interest, and responsibilities by group.\n- **Prioritized needs:** Ranked problem statements with brief rationale.\n- **Success criteria:** Acceptance conditions and measurable outcomes per need.\n\n## Page 5 — Goals, KPIs, and Measurement Plan\n- **North Star metric:** Primary indicator of roadmap success.\n- **Supporting KPIs:** Leading and lagging indicators with target ranges.\n- **Measurement approach:** Instrumentation, data sources, and ownership.\n- **Reporting cadence:** How often results are reviewed and by whom.\n- **Definition glossary:** Precise metric definitions to avoid ambiguity.\n\n## Page 6 — Roadmap Overview (Phases & Milestones)\n- **Phases:** Named phases with intent (e.g., Foundation, Expansion, Optimization).\n- **Milestones:** Major decision points and deliverable checkpoints.\n- **Dependency highlights:** Cross-team and external dependencies that shape timing.\n- **Assumption summary:** Critical assumptions that, if wrong, change the schedule.\n- **Milestone acceptance:** High-level criteria for entering/exiting each phase.\n\n## Page 7 — Workstreams & Initiatives (Portfolio View)\n- **Workstreams:** The big buckets of work (product, platform, data, ops, etc.).\n- **Initiative list:** Initiative name, objective, and primary output per item.\n- **Prioritization rationale:** Why these initiatives and why this order.\n- **Resource model (high level):** Relative effort bands and key roles.\n- **Interlocks:** Where workstreams intersect and require coordination.\n\n## Page 8 — Quarter/Phase Detail: Near-Term Plan\n- **Timeframe:** The next phase/quarter with explicit dates or sprint range.\n- **Deliverables:** Concrete outputs and the teams accountable.\n- **Key activities:** Major build, migrate, enablement, and change-management actions.\n- **Validation:** How learning is captured (pilots, experiments, user research).\n- **Exit criteria:** Conditions required to move to the subsequent timeframe.\n\n## Page 9 — Quarter/Phase Detail: Mid-Term Plan\n- **Timeframe:** The mid-horizon phase/quarter and its objectives.\n- **Deliverables:** Expanded capabilities, scaling, and process maturation.\n- **Technical evolution:** Architecture changes, reliability targets, and automation.\n- **Adoption plan:** Training, documentation, rollout strategy, and support.\n- **Review gates:** Decision checkpoints to re-prioritize based on outcomes.\n\n## Page 10 — Quarter/Phase Detail: Long-Term Plan\n- **Timeframe:** The long-horizon phase/quarter and strategic bets.\n- **Capability maturation:** Optimization, cost efficiency, and feature completeness.\n- **Innovation options:** Optional paths contingent on earlier milestones.\n- **Sustainment model:** Ownership, maintenance, and lifecycle planning.\n- **Sunset plan:** Decommissioning legacy components and cleanup milestones.\n\n## Page 11 — Risks, Dependencies, and Mitigations\n- **Risk register (top items):** Risk, likelihood, impact, and owner.\n- **Mitigation strategies:** Preventative actions and contingency plans.\n- **Dependency map:** Systems, vendors, approvals, and staffing dependencies.\n- **Compliance & security:** Required controls and review milestones.\n- **Change management risks:** Adoption barriers and communications approach.\n\n## Page 12 — Governance, Operating Model, and Appendix\n- **Governance structure:** Steering group, working groups, and decision rights.\n- **Execution cadence:** Planning, delivery, and review rhythms.\n- **Escalation path:** How issues move from teams to leadership.\n- **Communication plan:** Stakeholder updates, artifacts, and channels.\n- **Appendix pointers:** Where supporting materials live (metrics, research, architecture, logs).\"\"\"\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text,
