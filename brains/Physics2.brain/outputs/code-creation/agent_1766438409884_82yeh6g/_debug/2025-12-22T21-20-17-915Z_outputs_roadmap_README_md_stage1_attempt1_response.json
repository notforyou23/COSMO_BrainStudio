Each “page” below is a standalone Markdown file (one file per page) intended to be assembled into a single roadmap packet (PDF/slide-deck conversion optional).\n\n## Where each page file belongs\n\nCreate the following files under:\n\n- `outputs/roadmap/pages/` (recommended location for page markdown files)\n- Keep filenames stable; use version control history for iteration.\n\n| Page | File path (planned) | Title | What it contains (scope) |\n|---:|---|---|---|\n| 1 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/01-executive-summary.md` | Executive Summary | One-page narrative: goals, outcomes, timeline headline, and ask/decision. |\n| 2 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/02-context-and-problem.md` | Context & Problem | Current state, pain points, constraints, and why now; problem statement. |\n| 3 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/03-vision-and-principles.md` | Vision & Principles | Target vision, guiding principles, non-goals, and success definition. |\n| 4 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/04-scope-and-assumptions.md` | Scope & Assumptions | In-scope / out-of-scope, dependencies, key assumptions, and constraints. |\n| 5 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/05-user-and-stakeholders.md` | Users & Stakeholders | Personas, stakeholders, needs map, and prioritization of audiences. |\n| 6 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/06-objectives-and-kpis.md` | Objectives & KPIs | Measurable objectives, KPI tree, baseline/targets, measurement approach. |\n| 7 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/07-initiatives-portfolio.md` | Initiative Portfolio | Initiative list, value hypothesis, effort sizing, and prioritization rationale. |\n| 8 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/08-timeline-and-milestones.md` | Timeline & Milestones | Quarter-by-quarter (or sprint/phase) plan, milestone dates, releases. |\n| 9 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/09-resourcing-and-budget.md` | Resourcing & Budget | Roles/teams, capacity plan, budget ranges, build/buy decisions. |\n| 10 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/10-risks-and-mitigations.md` | Risks & Mitigations | Top risks, probability/impact, mitigations, owners, and triggers. |\n| 11 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/11-governance-and-operating-model.md` | Governance & Operating Model | Decision cadence, RACI, intake/change control, reporting, comms plan. |\n| 12 | `outputs/roadmap/pages/12-appendix.md` | Appendix | Glossary, references, assumptions log, sizing notes, and supporting tables. |\n\n## Assembly conventions (for consistent page-to-pack flow)\n\n- Each page file should start with an H1 matching the **Title** column above.\n- Keep “page” content concise (aim: 350–700 words equivalent per file).\n- Prefer tables/bullets for comparability (KPIs, initiatives, risks, milestones).\n- Use relative links when referencing other pages, e.g. `./pages/07-initiatives-portfolio.md`.\n\n## Versioning notes\n\n- Treat this folder as the distribution-ready artifact source for roadmap documentation.\n- When the outline changes, update this index first, then adjust the `pages/*` set to match.\n\"\"\"\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/roadmap/README.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))\n",
