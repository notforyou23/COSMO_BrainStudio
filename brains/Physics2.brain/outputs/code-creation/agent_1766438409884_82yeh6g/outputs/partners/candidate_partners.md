# Candidate External Partners (Stage 1)

This document provides an audit-traceable shortlist of candidate external partners and recommended collaboration models for early-stage execution. It is intentionally lightweight: partner names, what they bring, and a suggested first engagement step.

## Partner selection criteria (used for shortlist)
- **Strategic fit:** alignment with project scope and near-term milestones.
- **Capability:** proven delivery in the relevant domain (tech, data, policy, evaluation).
- **Speed to start:** availability of standard agreements, pilots, or existing programs.
- **Risk profile:** manageable legal/security/compliance posture; clear IP terms.
- **Leverage:** ability to unlock additional networks, funding, or distribution.

## Candidate partner shortlist (with collaboration recommendations)

### 1) Cloud & infrastructure
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** — Scalable hosting, managed data services, security tooling.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** startup/innovation credits + architecture review; ensure well-defined data residency and logging requirements.
- **Microsoft Azure** — Enterprise integration, governance tooling, strong identity/IAM patterns.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** credits + security baseline review; evaluate compatibility with existing Microsoft 365 tenant policies.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** — Data/ML primitives, analytics stack.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** credits + joint PoC for data pipeline and reproducible ML workflow.

### 2) Identity, security, and compliance support
- **Okta** — SSO/MFA and access governance for internal tools and partner portals.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** limited-scope integration pilot; establish role model and least-privilege access patterns.
- **Cloudflare** — Edge security, WAF, DDoS protection, performance.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** front-door protection for public endpoints; define incident response SLAs and logging retention.

### 3) Open-source foundations & standards bodies
- **Linux Foundation (and relevant hosted projects)** — Neutral governance, community processes, long-term sustainability.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** join as member or engage for best practices; evaluate if project should align to an existing LF umbrella.
- **W3C / IETF working groups (as applicable)** — Standards guidance and interoperability patterns.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** observer participation; map roadmap items to existing standards and avoid reinventing protocols.

### 4) Academic and research collaborators
- **MIT (relevant labs/centers)** — Rigorous methods, evaluation design, and research-to-product translation.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** short research sprints; co-author evaluation plan and publish non-sensitive findings.
- **Stanford (relevant labs/centers)** — HCI/AI expertise, responsible deployment frameworks.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** advisory relationship + study design review; establish ethics/IRB consultation path if needed.
- **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)** — Applied engineering and security/usable privacy strengths.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** targeted collaboration on security and threat modeling; conduct independent review.

### 5) Data & benchmarking sources
- **World Bank (open data initiatives)** — High-quality global indicators and documentation.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** data alignment + citation protocol; ensure consistent versioning of datasets for auditability.
- **OECD (data and policy artifacts)** — Comparative policy datasets and analytics.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** map policy taxonomy to project domain; establish reproducible data ingestion workflow.
- **Kaggle (public datasets/benchmarks)** — Rapid prototyping datasets and baseline comparisons.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** use only for non-sensitive experimentation; document licensing and dataset provenance.

### 6) Responsible tech & governance organizations
- **Partnership on AI (PAI)** — Responsible AI best practices and peer learning.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** adopt relevant frameworks; use working groups to pressure-test governance.
- **IEEE (ethics and standards initiatives)** — Engineering-aligned governance and standards references.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** align documentation with IEEE guidance; identify applicable standard checklists.

### 7) Implementation & delivery partners (consulting / integrators)
- **Thoughtworks** — Lean delivery, platform modernization, and strong engineering practices.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** time-boxed discovery + delivery blueprint; require measurable outcomes and handover plan.
- **Accenture** — Large-scale implementation capacity and enterprise change management.  
  **Recommended collaboration:** use for integration-heavy phases; negotiate clear IP, data handling, and exit clauses.

## Recommended engagement model (low-risk, high-signal)
1. **Intro + scope alignment (1–2 weeks):** share non-sensitive requirements and constraints; collect capability statements.
2. **Pilot/PoC (2–6 weeks):** small deliverable with explicit success metrics, security requirements, and documentation outputs.
3. **Scale decision:** extend to longer contract/MoU only after pilot results and governance review.

## Due diligence checklist (minimum)
- Confirm **data handling** (storage location, retention, access logging, subprocessors).
- Confirm **IP and licensing** terms for deliverables and dependencies.
- Confirm **security posture** (SOC2/ISO, vulnerability disclosure, incident response).
- Confirm **financials** (rate card, credits, non-profit discounts) and **exit strategy** (handover artifacts).

## Immediate next steps (internal)
- Select **3 priority partners** (1 infra, 1 research/evaluation, 1 governance) and schedule intro calls.
- Prepare a one-page **Partner Brief**: problem statement, constraints, timeline, success metrics, and contact roles.
- Record decisions in the audit log (date, rationale, and selected collaboration model).
