You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement prototype numerical / symbolic experiments that illustrate the behavior or consequences of the most promising candidate framework(s). This may include: toy-model simulations, symbolic derivations (e.g., effective action, renormalization flow), entanglement structure diagnostics, or small-scale lattice/graph models demonstrating emergence of classicality from quantum rules. Produce reproducible code and example outputs (plots, tables).
Project: generated_script_1766432556417 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/lib/io.py
- Purpose: Utilities for reproducible experiment runs including seeding, structured result saving (CSV/JSON), and output directory management.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- README.md: Project overview and step-by-step instructions to run the included reproducible toy-model experiments and reproduce plots/tables.
- requirements.txt: Pinned minimal Python dependencies required to run all numerical and symbolic experiments and generate outputs.
- src/cli.py: Command-line entrypoint that runs selected experiments, manages seeds/output directories, and saves plots/tables deterministically.
- src/lib/plotting.py: Plotting helpers for consistent styling and saving of figures generated by the toy experiments.

Key requirements:
- examples

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Utilities for reproducible experiment runs including seeding, structured result saving (CSV/JSON), and output directory management.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/lib/io.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/lib/io.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/lib/io.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
