Mission summary: Systematically map swampland conjectures and holographic constraints onto concrete, model-specific cosmological observables (inflationary/noninflationary dynamics, non-Gaussianity shapes/amplitudes, reheating/Trans-Planckian signals, and late-time dark-energy evolution). Produce prioritized, testable hypothesis pairs (conjecture → observable signature + consistency test) together with a short robustness plan under realistic compactification/flux choices and a recommended statistical pipeline outline for confronting current/forthcoming data.
Project: generated_script_1766433237062 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/core/robustness.py
- Purpose: Runs robustness plans under realistic compactification/flux choices via scenario samplers, sensitivity analyses, and stress tests for hypothesis stability.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/cli.py: Command-line entrypoint to run end-to-end hypothesis generation, robustness checks, and data-confrontation pipeline with reproducible configs.
- src/core/conjectures.py: Defines swampland conjecture objects, parameterizations, priors, and consistency-check evaluators used to map theory constraints into model-level bounds.
- src/core/models.py: Implements model-specific cosmology backends (inflationary/noninflationary, reheating, trans-Planckian, late-time dark energy) with observable calculators.
- src/core/observables.py: Computes concrete cosmological observables (ns, r, running, non-Gaussianity amplitudes/shapes, reheating signatures, dark-energy evolution) from model trajectories.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Runs robustness plans under realistic compactification/flux choices via scenario samplers, sensitivity analyses, and stress tests for hypothesis stability.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/core/robustness.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/core/robustness.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/core/robustness.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
