You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add a CI/pytest smoke test that imports key modules (including cosmo_contracts.markdown) to prevent regressions; fix the reported syntax error(s) and confirm `python -c 'import ...'` succeeds for all public entrypoints.
Project: generated_library_1766440776859 (python library)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_import_smoke.py
- Purpose: Pytest smoke test that imports all public entrypoints (including cosmo_contracts.markdown) and fails fast on any ImportError or SyntaxError regression.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/cosmo_contracts/markdown.py: Fix and fully implement the cosmo_contracts.markdown module with valid syntax and a stable public API so it can be imported in smoke tests and by users.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: GitHub Actions CI workflow that installs the package and runs pytest (including the import smoke test) on supported Python versions to prevent future import/syntax regressions.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pytest smoke test that imports all public entrypoints (including cosmo_contracts.markdown) and fails fast on any ImportError or SyntaxError regression.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_import_smoke.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_import_smoke.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_import_smoke.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
