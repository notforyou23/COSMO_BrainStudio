Mission summary: Implement centralized comparison utilities (absolute/relative tolerances, per-field tolerances, NaN handling) and enforce them in the benchmark runner and CI; add documentation of tolerance choices per observable.
Project: generated_script_1766440314740 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_runner_enforces_contract.py
- Purpose: Validates that the benchmark runner refuses missing/invalid tolerance documentation and correctly applies contract-defined tolerances when determining pass/fail.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/benchmarks/compare.py: Implements centralized comparison utilities supporting absolute/relative tolerances, per-field overrides, NaN/Inf handling, structured results, and rich mismatch reporting for benchmark outputs.
- src/benchmarks/contract.py: Defines the benchmark contract schema (including per-observable tolerance specifications) and provides loaders/validators to ensure each task declares required metadata and tolerance choices.
- src/benchmarks/runner.py: Runs benchmarks end-to-end, loads each task contract, executes candidate and reference algorithms, and enforces standardized comparisons using the centralized utilities with CI-friendly failure output.
- tests/test_compare.py: Provides unit tests for comparison behavior including absolute/relative tolerance logic, per-field overrides, NaN/Inf policies, shape/type checking, and deterministic mismatch messages.

Reference insights:
- [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, tool-supported “benchmark contract” for each v0.1 task—defining required metadata, a reference algo

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Validates that the benchmark runner refuses missing/invalid tolerance documentation and correctly applies contract-defined tolerances when determining pass/fail.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_runner_enforces_contract.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_runner_enforces_contract.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_runner_enforces_contract.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
