You are planning a python script implementation for the following mission:
Implement centralized comparison utilities (absolute/relative tolerances, per-field tolerances, NaN handling) and enforce them in the benchmark runner and CI; add documentation of tolerance choices per observable.

Relevant context:
- [CONSOLIDATED] Establish a standardized, tool-supported “benchmark contract” for each v0.1 task—defining required metadata, a reference algo

Explicit requirements:
- documentation

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
