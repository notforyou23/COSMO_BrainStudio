In parallel, empirical contact is increasingly discussed via two complementary routes: (a) high-energy astrophysical constraints on quantum-gravity-motivated effects (e.g., neutrino/astrophysical searches framed as QG tests), and (b) condensed-matter/analogue-gravity platforms that can reproduce horizon kinematics and Hawking-like phenomena (while repeatedly stressing that reproducing full

Encourage multiple programs to run these benchmarks (with open data) and report sensitivity to regulator choices, truncations, and coarse-graining steps.","Establish a coordinated theory-to-observable

equations.","findingsCount":5,"sourcesCount":121,"sources":["https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41114-025-00061-4","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-023-00586-z","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Reviews_in_Relativity","https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/quantum-physics/scientists-claim-to-find-first-observational-evidence-supporting-string-theory-which-could-finally-reveal-the-nature-of-dark-energy","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-024-00714-3","https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-1998-1","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-023-00600-4","https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/23/quantum-physics-microscopic-gravity-discovery","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-024-00799-w","https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00327","https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07595","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10714-023-03177-6","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-025-00875-w","https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03157","https://www.mdpi.com/books/reprint/2470","https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.086022","https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.046009","https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12768","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337263143_Quantum_gravity_from_Causal_Dynamical_Triangulations_A_review","https://indico.imapp.ru.nl/event/106/contributions/291/","https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08862","https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09495","https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.066012","https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10307","https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06810","https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.106005","https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2008-5","https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16072","https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12365","https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-981-19-3079-9","https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01260","https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02903","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP03%282025%29068","https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-981-99-7681-2","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-024-12485-3","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-019-0146-z","https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.086011","https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/353690/","https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12628","https://pure.psu.edu/en/publications/quantum-gravity-hydrodynamics-and-emergent-cosmology-a-collection","https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06838","https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03293","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-024-12413-5","https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05624","https://phys.org/news/2024-03-small-highly-sensitive-gravimeter-stably.html","https://www.impactlab.com/2024/03/08/pioneering-experiment-measures-weak-gravitational-pull-on-subatomic-scale/","https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.123601","https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.240601","https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.063601","https://www.nature.com/nature-index/article/10.1103/physrevlett.134.203601","https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.203601","https://www.nature.com/nature-index/article/10.1103/physrevlett.134.146603","https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-981-99-7681-2?utm_source=openai","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337263143_Quantum_gravity_from_Causal_Dynamical_Triangulations_A_review?utm_source=openai","https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06810?utm_source=openai","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-019-0146-z?utm_source=openai","https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.123601?utm_source=openai","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett%E2%80%93Crane_model","https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9910050","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321392900109","https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9202054","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/055032139390462X","https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0006107","https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0010031","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/055032139500343Q","https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-1998-1","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0370157396000518","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_foam","https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/spin_foam_models/","https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.56.3490","https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.52.5743","https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9505006","https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9612035","https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9809067","https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9411005","https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9709028","https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9202053","https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9411046","https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9904025","https://pure.psu.edu/en/publications/projective-techniques-and-functional-integration-for-gauge-theori","https://pure.psu.edu/en/publications/representations-of-the-holonomy-algebras-of-gravity-and-nonabelia/","https://axi.lims.ac.uk/paper/gr-qc%252F9905087","https://ashtekar.gravity.psu

control of continuum limits and approximation systematics: develop shared renormalization/continuum-extrapolation frameworks and benchmark tests that can be applied across CDT, asymptotic safety, and spin-foam/LQG truncations. Concrete tasks include (a) systematic studies of truncation dependence and error estimation methods, (b) coordinated continuum-scaling protocols (finite-size scaling, coupling-flow trajectories) that produce comparable effective actions, and (c) open benchmark problems (simple observables, toy geometries) for code and method validation.","Construction and computation of physical, diffeomorphism‑invariant Lorentzian observables: formulate practical relational observables and scattering/cosmological correlators that probe dynamics rather than just kinematics, and produce explicit calculations (with controlled approximations) in competing programs. Priority subprojects are (a) definitions of time‑and‑reference‑frame observables suitable for numerical/analytic evaluation, (b) bridging Euclidean and Lorentzian formulations (analytic continuation strategies, contour prescriptions) to ensure consistent dynamics, and (c) inclusion of matter couplings to test observationally relevant predictions.","Strengthen the experiment–theory interface for analogue and emergent platforms: design experiments and theoretical protocols that go beyond kinematic tests to constrain dynamical aspects and rule out alternative explanations. Specific directions are (a) quantitative modelling of horizon formation and backreaction in BECs with reproducible signatures (timing, entanglement measures, dependence on ramp protocols), (b) controlled tests in Weyl/topological semimetals to distinguish anomaly‑based transport from competing material effects (materials diagnostics, parameter scans, disorder control), and (c) explicit mapping recipes linking condensed‑matter observables to quantum‑gravity model parameters so analogue results can falsify or constrain classes of QG

Independent programs repeatedly converge on common mathematical infrastructure: constrained Hamiltonian systems and diffeomorphism invariance (separating physical from gauge degrees of freedom), effective field theory (EFT) as the organizing principle for low‑energy universality, and information‑theoretic structures—especially entanglement and quantum error‑correction—as candidates for the “glue” from which geometric notions (distance, connectivity, horizons) arise. In this view, “quantizing GR” is reframed as identifying the correct microscopic variables and flow to an infrared fixed point that reproduces GR+QFT on curved spacetime, while maintaining consistency constraints (anomalies, unitarity/causality, UV completion conditions) that sharply restrict viable theories.\n\nFrom these motifs, 2–3 unifying sketches recur as the most actionable: (A) holographic/string UV completions where bulk gravity is reconstructed from boundary quantum data, constrained by swampland consistency and yielding characteristic correlations among EFT parameters; (B) background‑independent, discretized or algebraic approaches (spin foams/LQG, causal sets, group field theory) where continuum geometry appears as a coarse‑grained phase with specific signatures of discretization or modified propagation; and (C) entanglement‑/tensor‑network induced gravity where geometry and dynamics track entropic and error‑correcting properties of underlying quantum states, predicting structured deviations in entropy laws and correlation functions. Empirically, the portfolio prioritizes tests where frameworks make separable claims: precision “EFT of gravity” consistency checks (including quantum corrections and equivalence‑principle bounds), horizon/entanglement diagnostics (black‑hole spectroscopy, gravitational‑wave ringdown structure, and quantum‑information constraints on evaporation), and potential discreteness/modified‑dispersion signals in high‑energy astrophysical timing and cosmological relics. The highest‑leverage theoretical challenges are: deriving GR+SM with controlled approximations and error bars, defining robust observables in background‑independent settings, proving the correct renormalization flow to the classical limit, and producing discriminating predictions that survive universality and parameter degeneracies.\n\n---\n\n## I. CROSS-CORPUS MOTIFS AND SHARED MATHEMATICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n## I. Cross-Corpus Motifs and Shared Mathematical Infrastructure\n\nAcross otherwise divergent quantum-gravity programs, the corpus repeatedly returns to **symmetry-as-structure**, especially the interplay between *gauge redundancy* and *physical degrees of freedom*. On the “continuum QFT” side, this appears as local symmetries plus consistency (Ward identities, BRST/BV formalisms), and—crucially—**anomaly constraints** that determine what can exist as a consistent quantum theory. The canonical example is the Green–Schwarz mechanism in string theory, where anomaly cancellation is not a cosmetic requirement but a *selection principle* for viable microscopic completions. In parallel, the swampland/no-global-symmetry motif sharpens the same idea into a global constraint: quantum gravity seems to disallow exact global symmetries, pushing “symmetry” toward being either gauged, emergent, or explicitly broken. On the “background-independent” side (canonical LQG, spin foams, GFT), symmetry is encoded less as a fixed spacetime isometry group and more as **diffeomorphism/gauge constraint structure**: the claim is not merely that GR has gauge invariance, but that recovering the *right* gauge symmetry in the continuum limit (effective diffeomorphism invariance) is the diagnostic for having obtained the correct macroscopic phase.\n\nA second shared infrastructure is the primacy of **constraint systems and their quantization**, which provides a common grammar for comparing canonical, covariant, and emergent approaches. Canonical GR and LQG are organized around first-class constraints—schematically, Gauss constraints \\(G_i\\), spatial diffeomorphism constraints \\(D_a\\), and the Hamiltonian constraint \\(H\\)—whose closure (the “Dirac algebra,” or its quantum deformation) encodes spacetime covariance. The historical LQG sequence in the corpus (Ashtekar variables; loop representation; spin networks) is best read as an extended attempt to represent these constraints nonperturbatively and to identify the physical Hilbert space as the kernel (or suitable solution space) of \\(\\hat G,\\hat D,\\hat H\\). Spin foams then repackage the same content covariantly as a sum-over-histories with amplitudes designed to implement constraints (e.g., simplicity/closure conditions). The cross-corpus tension is methodological but precise: string/holography often assumes a well-defined boundary Hilbert space and Hamiltonian evolution from the start (unitary CFT time), while canonical approaches treat “time” as emergent from solving constraints. This yields an actionable compatibility question: can the constraint algebra and its quantum implementation be mapped to boundary unitarity/causality constraints (or vice versa), or do they select different notions of observables and locality?\n\nThe most explicit unifying thread in the 2020–2025 framing is **renormalization-group (RG) flow and coarse-graining** as the bridge between microstructure and semiclassical gravity. Special-issue/editorial syntheses highlighted RG as the common technical language: whether one starts from a lattice-like/discrete model (spin foams, causal sets, CDT, tensor-network-inspired spin-foam coarse graining, GFT) or from continuum quantum fields (asymptotic safety, perturbative EFT around backgrounds), the key question becomes: *what are the fixed points, relevant couplings, and universality classes that reproduce GR plus quantum corrections at long distances?* In spin-foam/LQG-adjacent work, the recent shift toward continuum recovery is often phrased exactly this way: coarse-grain spin-foam amplitudes, diagnose restoration (or emergence) of effective diffeomorphism symmetry, and identify phases where large-scale geometry is smooth. In causal set theory, the analogous program is to show that non-manifold-like configurations are dynamically suppressed and to build QFT observables (entanglement entropy, in-in correlators) that behave “continuum-like” in appropriate limits. The shared vocabulary here—*effective action \\(\\Gamma_k\\), flow scale \\(k\\), relevant/irrelevant operators, continuum limit, universality*—allows direct comparison even when microscopic degrees of freedom differ radically.\n\nFinally, the corpus converges on **QFT on curved backgrounds and entanglement** as the operational meeting ground between fundamental theory and phenomenology. Effective field theory (EFT) logic treats gravity as an IR effective description with controlled corrections, while analogue-gravity experiments probe precisely those EFT-on-background predictions (Hawking-like emission, mode conversion, dispersive corrections, and the role of backreaction beyond fixed-background analogies). This empirical strand matters conceptually because it stresses what survives without committing to a specific UV completion: horizon thermality is entanglement/kinematics-driven, while detailed spectra and correlations depend on dispersion, stationarity, and backreaction—parameters that mirror “UV sensitivity” debates in true quantum gravity. In string theory, **holography** elevates entanglement from diagnostic to constitutive: bulk geometry is constrained (and in some constructions, partly reconstructible) from boundary entanglement structure, while consistency conditions (causality/unitarity on the boundary; anomaly matching) act as nonperturbative guards. Across approaches, this yields a sharp point of contact and friction: holography presumes a form of boundary completeness and unitarity, whereas discrete/emergent-geometry programs emphasize bulk microstructure and continuum emergence. The shared mathematical infrastructure—RG/coarse-graining, constraint consistency, anomaly/consistency conditions, and entanglement as an organizing observable—provides a concrete basis for identifying when programs make compatible assumptions (e.g., universality + effective diffeomorphism invariance) and when they genuinely diverge (e.g., fundamental locality vs entanglement-first reconstruction; boundary unitarity vs “timeless” constraint quantization).\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## II. CANDIDATE UNIFYING FRAMEWORK SKETCHES (2–3) WITH MINIMAL FORMALISMS\n\n## II. Candidate Unifying Framework Sketches (2–3) with Minimal Formalisms\n\nA cross-cutting motif in the 2019–2025 corpus is that “classical spacetime” is less a primitive entity than a *fixed point* of coarse graining: different microscopic proposals (strings/holography, spin foams/LQG, causal sets, analogue systems) can be compared by (i) their microscopic degrees of freedom, (ii) a controlled notion of renormalization/coarse graining, and (iii) the emergence of effective QFT on an approximately smooth Lorentzian geometry. This pushes unification away from purely interpretive debates and toward mathematically constrained, operationally anchored formalisms: algebraic/pAQFT tools for the continuum limit, background-independent RG for discrete path integrals, and information-theoretic constraints (entanglement, error correction, no-global-symmetries) that can be tested indirectly via consistency conditions and (in a few cases) via analogue platforms that realize “QFT on an effective curved background” with metrologically tractable systematics.\n\n**Framework A: Background-independent RG to an EFT fixed point (spin foams/LQG ↔ causal sets ↔ EFT/analogue gravity).** *(a) Assumptions/DOF:* Microscopic spacetime is discrete/combinatorial (2-complexes with spin labels in spin foams; partially ordered sets in causal sets). Classical geometry appears only after coarse graining, and “continuum GR + QFT” is identified with a universality class rather than a unique micro-model. *(b) Minimal formalism:* Start from a background-independent partition function on discretizations \\(D\\):  \n\\[\nZ \\;=\\; \\sum_{D}\\;\\sum_{\\{\\sigma\\}} \\; \\exp\\!\\big(-S_{\\text{micro}}[D,\\sigma]\\big),\n\\]\nwith \\(\\sigma\\) denoting micro-labels (e.g., spin-foam representations/intertwiners or causal-set sprinklings/labels). Define a coarse-graining map \\(C: (D,\\sigma)\\mapsto (D',\\sigma')\\) and an induced RG flow on couplings \\(\\{g_i\\}\\): \\(g_i'=\\mathcal{R}_C(g_i)\\). Continuum recovery is diagnosed by approach to a fixed point \\(g^\\star\\) with restoration (approximate) of diffeomorphism symmetry and emergence of a local effective action  \n\\[\nS_{\\text{eff}}[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\phi]=\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\,\\Big(\\tfrac{1}{16\\pi G}R + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QFT}}(\\phi,g) + \\sum_n \\tfrac{c_n}{M^{n-4}}\\mathcal{O}_n\\Big).\n\\]\nTechnically, the “continuum QFT” side can be anchored using pAQFT/AQFT-style locality (nets/factorization) so that the limit is not just geometric but also *algebraic*: local observables should satisfy causal factorization and controlled renormalization. *(c) Relation to pillars:* This is explicitly aligned with the spin-foam shift toward tensor-network-inspired coarse graining and symmetry restoration, and with causal-set progress on dynamics that suppress non-manifold-like configurations plus developing QFT observables on causal sets (entanglement entropy, in-in correlators/scattering) to connect microstructure to phenomenology. Analogue gravity enters as an empirical “EFT sanity check”: dispersive mode conversion and Hawking-like emission test which low-energy features are universal under UV modifications (a direct analogue of universality under RG). *(d) Predicted signatures:* Low-energy deviations appear as higher-dimension operators (modified dispersion, Lorentz-violating/curvature-coupled terms) and as specific “discreteness noise” in correlators. Targets include: cosmological correlators (running/non-Gaussianity patterns compatible with a particular EFT operator set), black-hole near-horizon two-point functions (robustness of thermality under UV dispersion, informed by analogue results), and causal-set-specific imprints such as stochastic fluctuations in propagation or entanglement-entropy corrections. Priority challenges are (i) defining a robust coarse-graining map with gauge/diffeomorphism control, and (ii) computing *observable* correlators across the flow rather than only kinematical quantities.\n\n**Framework B: Operational quantum-causal modeling with emergent classical spacetime as a decohered sector (indefinite causal order ↔ semiclassical EFT ↔ testable decoherence).** *(a) Assumptions/DOF:* Fundamental description is a network of quantum operations with no assumed global time order; “classical causal structure” is an emergent constraint when certain degrees of freedom decohere. Matter systems are open: tracing out inaccessible gravitational/spacetime degrees of freedom yields effective noise (potentially including gravity-induced dephasing). *(b) Minimal formalism:* Use a process-matrix / quantum-comb style object \\(W\\) that assigns probabilities to local instruments \\(\\{M_a\\}\\):  \n\\[\np(a,b,\\dots)=\\mathrm{Tr}\\!\\left[W\\,(M_a\\otimes M_b\\otimes \\cdots)\\right],\n\\]\nwhere classical spacetime corresponds to the subset of \\(W\\) compatible with a definite causal order. The classical limit is modeled by a coarse-graining/decoherence channel \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) on \\(W\\) (or on an underlying joint state) that suppresses interference between distinct causal/metric configurations: schematically, \\(\\rho \\mapsto \\mathcal{D}(\\rho)=\\sum_\\alpha \\Pi_\\alpha \\rho \\Pi_\\alpha\\) (or a Lindblad generator \\(\\dot\\rho=-i[H,\\rho]+\\sum_k L_k\\rho L_k^\\dagger-\\tfrac12\\{L_k^\\dagger L_k,\\rho\\}\\)). In the regime where a semiclassical metric is valid, \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) should reduce to EFT-consistent phase noise scaling with gravitational potential/time-dilation differences—precisely the kind of residual, environment-insensitive dephasing singled out in recent synthesis discussions as a discriminator against purely technical noise. *(c) Relation to pillars:* This framework absorbs the corpus trend toward operational/testable foundations (quantum causal modeling, indefinite causal order) while remaining compatible with pAQFT/AQFT locality once a classical background emerges. It also provides a common language to compare “gravity as an irreducible decoherer” proposals with conventional open-system decoherence (engineering noise), giving a clear experimental decision criterion: does decoherence persist under aggressive dynamical decoupling/error correction and scale with gravitational parameters? *(d) Predicted signatures:* Near-term signatures are laboratory-scale: differential interferometry or clock-in-superposition experiments where engineered noise is held fixed while gravitational potential differences vary; the key observable is a residual dephasing rate with the predicted gravitational scaling (and possibly a characteristic frequency dependence that distinguishes it from technical \\(1/f\\) noise). In cosmology/black holes, the same logic predicts a transition from indefinite/quantum causal structure to an effectively classical one, potentially leaving constrained forms of primordial decoherence or horizon-scale “information loss channels” that must still respect EFT locality in the emergent regime.\n\n**Framework C: Entanglement-first holographic emergence with consistency constraints (holography/string ↔ EFT ↔ swampland; optional bridge to spin-foam tensor networks).** *(a) Assumptions/DOF:* Quantum gravity is defined (where available) by a boundary quantum system; bulk geometry is an emergent encoding of boundary entanglement, and not every low-energy EFT can be UV completed (swampland constraints). Classical spacetime corresponds to code subspaces with semiclassical bulk duals. *(b) Minimal formalism:* The unifying data are (i) boundary state/entanglement structure, (ii) a bulk reconstruction map, and (iii) an error-correcting property. At the “minimal equation” level this can be summarized by entanglement/geometry relations (e.g., generalized entropy) and subregion duality: bulk region \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) boundary entanglement wedge. Semiclassical dynamics is constrained by consistency conditions like “no global symmetries” and by swampland-style bounds on EFT parameter space (e.g., towers of states over large field distances; gravity as the weakest force). *(c) Relation to pillars:* This squarely matches the corpus observation that string-based QG is dominated by holography as the sharpest nonperturbative definition and by the swampland program as a systematic filter on EFTs, with increasing attention to cosmology. Methodologically, it resonates with spin-foam/LQG tensor-network coarse graining: both treat “geometry” as emerging from entanglement/graph structure, differing mainly in whether a boundary definition is assumed. *(d) Predicted signatures:* Empirical traction is indirect but sharp: (i) cosmological model-building constraints—limits on stable de Sitter-like EFTs, characteristic correlated predictions for inflationary potentials/spectra, and expectations of additional light towers in certain regimes; (ii) black-hole information constraints—unitarity-compatible Page-curve behavior and specific patterns of entanglement wedge reconstruction; (iii) low-energy deviations that appear not as arbitrary corrections but as *forbidden regions* in EFT parameter space (e.g., restrictions on global symmetries, charge-to-mass spectra). The highest-priority challenge is translating these constraints into *quantitative, falsifiable* cosmological/astrophysical discriminants, rather than broad “no-go” statements.\n\nAcross all three sketches, the reconciliation of classical and quantum descriptions is organized around explicit maps: micro-to-macro coarse graining (Framework A), quantum-to-classical causal emergence via decoherence/operational constraints (Framework B), and entanglement-to-geometry encoding plus EFT consistency filters (Framework C). The shared technical agenda suggested by the corpus is to (1) make coarse graining mathematically controlled (RG + locality/algebraic structures), (2) compute genuinely observable correlators/entropies rather than only kinematics, and (3) attach each proposal to a small set of discriminating signatures—especially those testable in analogue platforms (robustness of Hawking-like phenomena under UV dispersion) and in precision decoherence experiments that can separate technical noise from gravity-tied channels.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## III. EMPIRICAL SIGNATURE PORTFOLIO AND EXPERIMENTAL/OBSERVATIONAL PATHWAYS\n\n## III. Empirical Signature Portfolio and Experimental/Observational Pathways\n\nA coherent empirical portfolio for quantum-gravity candidates should be organized around *where* the different frameworks make controllably distinct claims: (i) quantum field theory (QFT) on effective curved backgrounds (including horizon kinematics), (ii) precision departures from semiclassical gravity (backreaction, decoherence, equivalence-principle and Lorentz-sector tests), (iii) early-universe initial-state and dynamical imprints (spectra, non-Gaussianities, and relic features), (iv) black-hole information recovery channels (late-time ringdown structure, echoes, and horizon-scale modifications), and (v) discrete-structure signatures (modified dispersion, spectral-dimension flow, and diffusion-like observables). The unifying methodological theme across these domains is to treat prospective quantum-gravity effects as *controlled deformations* of semiclassical effective field theory—often parameterized by dispersion corrections, nonlocality scales, additional channels of decoherence, or running effective dimensions—and then to map these deformations to measurable correlators with explicit sensitivity targets. This “EFT-plus-discriminators” approach aligns well with renormalization/coarse-graining ideas that now act as a cross-program lingua franca (e.g., background-independent coarse graining in spin foams, RG flow in asymptotic safety, and scale-dependent dimensionality in discrete approaches), allowing otherwise heterogeneous theories to be compared at the level of scaling exponents, universality classes, and symmetry-restoration patterns.\n\n**Analogue-gravity probes** provide the most direct, laboratory-controlled access to the kinematics of horizons and particle production, but must be interpreted as tests of *QFT-on-an-effective-metric* rather than direct tests of quantum gravity. Across platforms (water waves, BECs, nonlinear optics), experiments have targeted Hawking-like emission via mode conversion and correlations, including stimulated Hawking emission in water-wave analogues (PRL 2011) and widely discussed BEC claims of spontaneous Hawking radiation with correlation signatures (Nature Physics 2016). Post-2016 efforts increasingly emphasize falsifiability: verifying stationarity and separating genuine horizon-induced correlations from finite-temperature backgrounds, noise, and time-dependent transients, while also incorporating dispersive corrections and backreaction beyond the fixed-background approximation (including number-conserving and backreaction-aware treatments in BEC theory). In this portfolio, analogue experiments serve two discriminator roles: (1) *robustness tests* of Hawking/Unruh universality against UV dispersion (a proxy for “trans-Planckian” sensitivity), and (2) *systematics stress-tests* of correlation-based observables (e.g., density–density correlators) under controlled departures from ideal horizon conditions. Near-term opportunities lie in metrologically tighter correlation measurements with calibrated temperature/dispersion budgets and in protocols that vary the effective dispersion relation or horizon formation history to isolate universal features (e.g., thermality windows, partner-mode correlations) from platform-specific artifacts.\n\n**Precision semiclassical and “beyond-QFTCS” tests** form a second pathway: rather than chase Planck-suppressed effects directly, they target scenarios predicting *irreducible* deviations from unitary QFT in curved spacetime, such as gravity-linked dephasing channels, violations of local Lorentz invariance, or small equivalence-principle anomalies in quantum regimes. The key discriminator strategy is differential control: aggressively characterize technical/environmental noise (via noise spectroscopy, dynamical decoupling, and error budgeting), then vary only a gravitational parameter (height/potential difference, clock-rate shift, curvature proxy) to look for residual decoherence with the predicted scaling. This logic parallels the broader field’s push to move from qualitative “it might decohere” claims toward parameterized open-system models with identifiable spectral signatures (e.g., whether the putative gravitational noise is low-frequency and suppressible, or an irreducible channel). In parallel, discrete microstructure approaches motivate stringent Lorentz-violation searches through modified dispersion and birefringence constraints, while their internal coarse-graining programs motivate *dimension-flow* observables (e.g., spectral dimension running inferred from diffusion-like probes or effective propagation kernels). Here, the near-term empirical leverage is largely negative (tightening bounds) but highly discriminating: many discrete-structure models must either realize symmetry restoration in the continuum limit or retreat to parameter regions already pressured by high-precision constraints.\n\n**Cosmological and black-hole observables** provide the longest lever arm in energy/curvature and thus the most direct contact with “UV completion” claims, albeit at the cost of model degeneracy and astrophysical systematics. In cosmology, the signature portfolio should emphasize (i) departures from near-scale-invariant primordial spectra, (ii) characteristic shapes of non-Gaussianity, (iii) feature/oscillation templates tied to new physics scales or initial-state modifications, and (iv) consistency relations that probe whether inflationary (or alternative) dynamics are embedded in a controlled UV framework. This is where string-theory–adjacent constraints (e.g., swampland-inspired restrictions on scalar potentials or field ranges) become empirically relevant not as direct tests of strings, but as *consistency filters* that correlate otherwise independent observables (tensor-to-scalar ratio, running, non-Gaussianity amplitude/shape) and sharpen “allowed” regions of parameter space. For black holes, the most actionable program is precision gravitational-wave spectroscopy: searching for ringdown deviations, overtone structure anomalies, and (more speculatively) late-time echoes or horizon-scale modifications that would indicate departures from classical Kerr boundary conditions. The portfolio logic is to connect each putative near-horizon modification to a predicted transfer function in the ringdown/late-time waveform and to demand multi-event consistency (population-level inference) to beat down astrophysical variance. Across both cosmology and black holes, the central discriminator is not “a deviation exists,” but whether the deviation matches a *framework-typical pattern*: holographic scenarios tend to reorganize questions around boundary observables and information flow; background-independent discrete approaches often predict scale-dependent propagation (dimension flow, nonlocal kernels) and require demonstrable symmetry recovery; and semiclassical-plus-open-system models emphasize specific decoherence scalings and correlation-loss channels. The immediate deliverable for the program is therefore a mapping from candidate frameworks to (a) the minimal set of observables that break degeneracies, (b) the sensitivity threshold where each effect becomes testable, and (c) a prioritized sequence of near-term measurements—analogue correlation benchmarks, precision decoherence differentials, Lorentz-sector bounds, and multi-event ringdown inference—that can most rapidly eliminate broad classes of mechanisms while remaining interpretable within a shared EFT/coarse-grained language.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## IV. DEVELOPMENT ROADMAPS, PRIORITY CHALLENGES, AND DECISION TABLE\n\n## IV. Development Roadmaps, Priority Challenges, and Decision Table\n\n### Candidate A: **Holographic/String-Theoretic UV Completions (AdS/CFT + Swampland-Constrained EFT)**\n**Prioritized theoretical challenges.** (1) **Recovery of GR+SM:** sharpen the map from specific compactifications/dual CFT data to realistic low-energy spectra and couplings, including moduli stabilization and hierarchies. (2) **Continuum limit:** while holography is nonperturbative where defined, the “continuum” issue reappears as the emergence of a semiclassical bulk from large‑N, strong-coupling CFT data and controlling \\(1/N\\) and \\(\\alpha'\\) corrections. (3) **Background independence:** the dual QFT definition is background-fixed in a boundary sense; the open problem is a truly general, background-agnostic formulation beyond known asymptotics. (4) **Unitarity/causality:** mostly a strength (unitarity is built in), but the challenge is reconstructing bulk locality/causal structure from boundary correlators and entanglement, and delimiting when locality fails. (5) **Anomaly cancellation:** comparatively mature (string consistency is tightly constrained), but realistic models must still satisfy detailed anomaly constraints after symmetry breaking. (6) **Computational tractability:** extracting cosmology and real-world observables from strongly coupled QFTs and complex compactifications remains the bottleneck.  \n**Stepwise roadmap.** (i) Consolidate a “minimal predictive pipeline” from swampland constraints \\(\\rightarrow\\) admissible EFT classes \\(\\rightarrow\\) cosmological/particle signatures, treating conjectures as falsifiable hypotheses rather than axioms. (ii) Use holography as a controlled laboratory to derive bulk emergence diagnostics (entanglement wedges, modular flow) and quantify corrections to semiclassical gravity. (iii) Couple the pipeline to near-term empirical hooks: early-universe consistency relations, constraints on scalar potentials (inflation/quintessence), and precision tests sensitive to light fields/moduli. (iv) Iterate via failure modes: if swampland constraints prove too restrictive or inconsistent with data, refine or discard specific conjectures while retaining robust consistency constraints (no global symmetries, completeness).\n\n### Candidate B: **Background-Independent Discrete/Microscopic Spacetime with RG/Coarse-Graining (LQG/Spin Foams/GFT/CDT + Causal-Set QFT Observables)**\n**Prioritized theoretical challenges.** (1) **Continuum limit (top priority):** demonstrate that a controlled coarse-graining/renormalization flow yields a universal semiclassical phase with local Lorentzian geometry and the Einstein equations (or a well-defined deformation). The 2019–2025 synthesis trend explicitly elevates **RG/coarse graining as the unifying thread** across these approaches. (2) **Recovery of GR+SM:** obtain the correct graviton propagator/low-energy amplitudes and incorporate realistic matter (chiral fermions, gauge sectors) without ad hoc tuning. (3) **Unitarity/causality:** discrete dynamics must reproduce causal propagation and avoid pathological nonlocality; causal-set programs, in particular, prioritize QFT observables (entanglement entropy, in-in correlators/scattering) to make these questions calculational. (4) **Anomaly cancellation:** ensure that discretization and quantization preserve gauge consistency (including potential gravitational anomalies in effective matter sectors). (5) **Background independence:** typically a strength (no fixed geometry), but it becomes a challenge when defining observables, time, and S-matrix notions. (6) **Computational tractability:** coarse-graining flows and large-state-sum evaluations are expensive; progress depends on effective truncations, tensor-network methods, and benchmark observables.  \n**Stepwise roadmap.** (i) Define benchmark observables that survive discretization and can be compared across models (two-point functions, entanglement diagnostics, causal response functions), leveraging the causal-set push toward **predictive QFT-on-discrete-structures**. (ii) Build and validate RG/coarse-graining machinery that identifies fixed points/phases and quantifies universality (what details do *not* matter in the IR). (iii) Demonstrate semiclassical spacetime emergence in a regime where matter can be coupled consistently; require recovery of GR at long distances as a non-negotiable milestone rather than an aspiration. (iv) Only after a stable semiclassical phase is established, invest heavily in SM-like matter embedding and precision phenomenology (Lorentz-violation bounds, dispersion, cosmological signatures). (v) Cross-calibrate with continuum EFT expectations to prevent “interpretive drift”: every new discrete ingredient must come with an RG/observable justification.\n\n### Candidate C: **Operational/Open-System Quantum Gravity Interface (Decoherence + Indefinite Causal Structure as Test-First Constraints)**\n**Prioritized theoretical challenges.** (1) **Unitarity vs. effective non-unitarity:** reconcile standard unitary quantum theory with the possibility of an *irreducible* gravity-linked dephasing channel (the key tension: “all decoherence is engineering” vs “gravity-induced residual decoherence”). (2) **Causality:** formulate consistent notions of causal influence/no-signaling when causal structure may be indefinite, while keeping predictions operationally testable. (3) **Recovery of GR+SM:** derive when and how classical spacetime and QFT on curved spacetime emerge as effective descriptions of underlying quantum/operational constraints. (4) **Background independence:** encode gravitational effects through relational observables (clock/time dilation degrees of freedom) rather than fixed background metrics. (5) **Anomaly cancellation:** not central at the outset, but any coupling to gauge/matter sectors must respect standard consistency constraints. (6) **Computational tractability:** the advantage here is model-building in terms of noise channels, filter functions, and open-system master equations that are directly comparable to experiment.  \n**Stepwise roadmap.** (i) Execute the high-ROI experimental logic recommended by the 2019–2025 consistency synthesis: **(a)** do noise spectroscopy and aggressive dynamical decoupling/error mitigation first; **(b)** only then search for a residual decoherence channel that is insensitive to engineering controls. (ii) Design differential tests where local environment is fixed while gravitational parameters vary (height/potential difference, “clock in superposition,” mass-superposition interferometry), explicitly targeting the proposed scaling laws (e.g., dependence on gravitational potential differences). (iii) Develop quantitative open-system models coupling matter to semiclassical gravity and predict not just rates but *spectral structure*—crucial for deciding whether control sequences can suppress the effect. (iv) If a reproducible residual is found, elevate it into a constraint on candidate microtheories (Candidates A/B): any viable theory must reproduce (or robustly exclude) the observed channel while preserving no-signaling and controlled limits.\n\n---\n\n### Decision Table (1 = low, 5 = high)\nScores are meant to guide portfolio decisions rather than declare winners; “resource requirements” is scored as **burden** (5 = most expensive).\n\n| Candidate | Feasibility (5=near-term progress) | Novelty / Unification leverage | Testability (near-term empirical hooks) | Resource requirements (5=highest) | Key near-term deliverable |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|\n| A.

Even null results are valuable because they set quantitative constraints that Candidates A and B must respect.  \n2) **Parallel core theory in Candidate B (RG/coarse-graining as the spine):** invest steadily in continuum-limit/coarse-graining infrastructure and in QFT observables on discrete structures, because this is the gating item for any background-independent microtheory to become predictive.  \n3) **Targeted bets in Candidate A (where dual control exists):** prioritize holographic calculations and swampland-to-EFT translation only where they produce hard constraints or clear cosmology-facing signatures. Avoid over-allocating to conjecture exploration without explicit falsifiable outputs.  \n\nOverall, the recommended program treats **RG/coarse-graining and operational benchmarks** as the shared “currency” across approaches: Candidate C supplies near-term falsification pressure and noise-model discipline; Candidate B supplies the emergence/continuum machinery needed for a full background-independent theory; Candidate A supplies the sharpest nonperturbative definitions in special settings and a consistency-constraint engine that can rapidly prune implausible low-energy scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Micro-to-macro mechanism for spacetime emergence — The corpus identifies entanglement structures and emergent degrees of freedom as central motifs, but lacks a concrete, dynamical microphysical model (Hamiltonian or path-integral measure) and a precise coarse-graining / renormalization map that produces Lorentzian classical spacetime with Einstein dynamics.

Independent programs repeatedly converge on common mathematical infrastructure: constrained Hamiltonian systems and diffeomorphism invariance (separating physical from gauge degrees of freedom), effective field theory (EFT) as the organizing principle for low‑energy universality, and information‑theoretic structures—especially entanglement and quantum error‑correction—as candidates for the “glue” from which geometric notions (distance, connectivity, horizons) arise. In this view, “quantizing GR” is reframed as identifying the correct microscopic variables and flow to an infrared fixed point that reproduces GR+QFT on curved spacetime, while maintaining consistency constraints (anomalies, unitarity/causality, UV completion conditions) that sharply restrict viable theories.\n\nFrom these motifs, 2–3 unifying sketches recur as the most actionable: (A) holographic/string UV completions where bulk gravity is reconstructed from boundary quantum data, constrained by swampland consistency and yielding characteristic correlations among EFT parameters; (B) background‑independent, discretized or algebraic approaches (spin foams/LQG, causal sets, group field theory) where continuum geometry appears as a coarse‑grained phase with specific signatures of discretization or modified propagation; and (C) entanglement‑/tensor‑network induced gravity where geometry and dynamics track entropic and error‑correcting properties of underlying quantum states, predicting structured deviations in entropy laws and correlation functions. Empirically, the portfolio prioritizes tests where frameworks make separable claims: precision “EFT of gravity” consistency checks (including quantum corrections and equivalence‑principle bounds), horizon/entanglement diagnostics (black‑hole spectroscopy, gravitational‑wave ringdown structure, and quantum‑information constraints on evaporation), and potential discreteness/modified‑dispersion signals in high‑energy astrophysical timing and cosmological relics. The highest‑leverage theoretical challenges are: deriving GR+SM with controlled approximations and error bars, defining robust observables in background‑independent settings, proving the correct renormalization flow to the classical limit, and producing discriminating predictions that survive universality and parameter degeneracies.\n\n---\n\n## I. CROSS-CORPUS MOTIFS AND SHARED MATHEMATICAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n## I. Cross-Corpus Motifs and Shared Mathematical Infrastructure\n\nAcross otherwise divergent quantum-gravity programs, the corpus repeatedly returns to **symmetry-as-structure**, especially the interplay between *gauge redundancy* and *physical degrees of freedom*. On the “continuum QFT” side, this appears as local symmetries plus consistency (Ward identities, BRST/BV formalisms), and—crucially—**anomaly constraints** that determine what can exist as a consistent quantum theory. The canonical example is the Green–Schwarz mechanism in string theory, where anomaly cancellation is not a cosmetic requirement but a *selection principle* for viable microscopic completions. In parallel, the swampland/no-global-symmetry motif sharpens the same idea into a global constraint: quantum gravity seems to disallow exact global symmetries, pushing “symmetry” toward being either gauged, emergent, or explicitly broken. On the “background-independent” side (canonical LQG, spin foams, GFT), symmetry is encoded less as a fixed spacetime isometry group and more as **diffeomorphism/gauge constraint structure**: the claim is not merely that GR has gauge invariance, but that recovering the *right* gauge symmetry in the continuum limit (effective diffeomorphism invariance) is the diagnostic for having obtained the correct macroscopic phase.\n\nA second shared infrastructure is the primacy of **constraint systems and their quantization**, which provides a common grammar for comparing canonical, covariant, and emergent approaches. Canonical GR and LQG are organized around first-class constraints—schematically, Gauss constraints \\(G_i\\), spatial diffeomorphism constraints \\(D_a\\), and the Hamiltonian constraint \\(H\\)—whose closure (the “Dirac algebra,” or its quantum deformation) encodes spacetime covariance. The historical LQG sequence in the corpus (Ashtekar variables; loop representation; spin networks) is best read as an extended attempt to represent these constraints nonperturbatively and to identify the physical Hilbert space as the kernel (or suitable solution space) of \\(\\hat G,\\hat D,\\hat H\\). Spin foams then repackage the same content covariantly as a sum-over-histories with amplitudes designed to implement constraints (e.g., simplicity/closure conditions). The cross-corpus tension is methodological but precise: string/holography often assumes a well-defined boundary Hilbert space and Hamiltonian evolution from the start (unitary CFT time), while canonical approaches treat “time” as emergent from solving constraints. This yields an actionable compatibility question: can the constraint algebra and its quantum implementation be mapped to boundary unitarity/causality constraints (or vice versa), or do they select different notions of observables and locality?\n\nThe most explicit unifying thread in the 2020–2025 framing is **renormalization-group (RG) flow and coarse-graining** as the bridge between microstructure and semiclassical gravity. Special-issue/editorial syntheses highlighted RG as the common technical language: whether one starts from a lattice-like/discrete model (spin foams, causal sets, CDT, tensor-network-inspired spin-foam coarse graining, GFT) or from continuum quantum fields (asymptotic safety, perturbative EFT around backgrounds), the key question becomes: *what are the fixed points, relevant couplings, and universality classes that reproduce GR plus quantum corrections at long distances?* In spin-foam/LQG-adjacent work, the recent shift toward continuum recovery is often phrased exactly this way: coarse-grain spin-foam amplitudes, diagnose restoration (or emergence) of effective diffeomorphism symmetry, and identify phases where large-scale geometry is smooth. In causal set theory, the analogous program is to show that non-manifold-like configurations are dynamically suppressed and to build QFT observables (entanglement entropy, in-in correlators) that behave “continuum-like” in appropriate limits. The shared vocabulary here—*effective action \\(\\Gamma_k\\), flow scale \\(k\\), relevant/irrelevant operators, continuum limit, universality*—allows direct comparison even when microscopic degrees of freedom differ radically.\n\nFinally, the corpus converges on **QFT on curved backgrounds and entanglement** as the operational meeting ground between fundamental theory and phenomenology. Effective field theory (EFT) logic treats gravity as an IR effective description with controlled corrections, while analogue-gravity experiments probe precisely those EFT-on-background predictions (Hawking-like emission, mode conversion, dispersive corrections, and the role of backreaction beyond fixed-background analogies). This empirical strand matters conceptually because it stresses what survives without committing to a specific UV completion: horizon thermality is entanglement/kinematics-driven, while detailed spectra and correlations depend on dispersion, stationarity, and backreaction—parameters that mirror “UV sensitivity” debates in true quantum gravity. In string theory, **holography** elevates entanglement from diagnostic to constitutive: bulk geometry is constrained (and in some constructions, partly reconstructible) from boundary entanglement structure, while consistency conditions (causality/unitarity on the boundary; anomaly matching) act as nonperturbative guards. Across approaches, this yields a sharp point of contact and friction: holography presumes a form of boundary completeness and unitarity, whereas discrete/emergent-geometry programs emphasize bulk microstructure and continuum emergence. The shared mathematical infrastructure—RG/coarse-graining, constraint consistency, anomaly/consistency conditions, and entanglement as an organizing observable—provides a concrete basis for identifying when programs make compatible assumptions (e.g., universality + effective diffeomorphism invariance) and when they genuinely diverge (e.g., fundamental locality vs entanglement-first reconstruction; boundary unitarity vs “timeless” constraint quantization).\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## II. CANDIDATE UNIFYING FRAMEWORK SKETCHES (2–3) WITH MINIMAL FORMALISMS\n\n## II. Candidate Unifying Framework Sketches (2–3) with Minimal Formalisms\n\nA cross-cutting motif in the 2019–2025 corpus is that “classical spacetime” is less a primitive entity than a *fixed point* of coarse graining: different microscopic proposals (strings/holography, spin foams/LQG, causal sets, analogue systems) can be compared by (i) their microscopic degrees of freedom, (ii) a controlled notion of renormalization/coarse graining, and (iii) the emergence of effective QFT on an approximately smooth Lorentzian geometry. This pushes unification away from purely interpretive debates and toward mathematically constrained, operationally anchored formalisms: algebraic/pAQFT tools for the continuum limit, background-independent RG for discrete path integrals, and information-theoretic constraints (entanglement, error correction, no-global-symmetries) that can be tested indirectly via consistency conditions and (in a few cases) via analogue platforms that realize “QFT on an effective curved background” with metrologically tractable systematics.\n\n**Framework A: Background-independent RG to an EFT fixed point (spin foams/LQG ↔ causal sets ↔ EFT/analogue gravity).** *(a) Assumptions/DOF:* Microscopic spacetime is discrete/combinatorial (2-complexes with spin labels in spin foams; partially ordered sets in causal sets). Classical geometry appears only after coarse graining, and “continuum GR + QFT” is identified with a universality class rather than a unique micro-model. *(b) Minimal formalism:* Start from a background-independent partition function on discretizations \\(D\\):  \n\\[\nZ \\;=\\; \\sum_{D}\\;\\sum_{\\{\\sigma\\}} \\; \\exp\\!\\big(-S_{\\text{micro}}[D,\\sigma]\\big),\n\\]\nwith \\(\\sigma\\) denoting micro-labels (e.g., spin-foam representations/intertwiners or causal-set sprinklings/labels). Define a coarse-graining map \\(C: (D,\\sigma)\\mapsto (D',\\sigma')\\) and an induced RG flow on couplings \\(\\{g_i\\}\\): \\(g_i'=\\mathcal{R}_C(g_i)\\). Continuum recovery is diagnosed by approach to a fixed point \\(g^\\star\\) with restoration (approximate) of diffeomorphism symmetry and emergence of a local effective action  \n\\[\nS_{\\text{eff}}[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\phi]=\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\,\\Big(\\tfrac{1}{16\\pi G}R + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QFT}}(\\phi,g) + \\sum_n \\tfrac{c_n}{M^{n-4}}\\mathcal{O}_n\\Big).\n\\]\nTechnically, the “continuum QFT” side can be anchored using pAQFT/AQFT-style locality (nets/factorization) so that the limit is not just geometric but also *algebraic*: local observables should satisfy causal factorization and controlled renormalization. *(c) Relation to pillars:* This is explicitly aligned with the spin-foam shift toward tensor-network-inspired coarse graining and symmetry restoration, and with causal-set progress on dynamics that suppress non-manifold-like configurations plus developing QFT observables on causal sets (entanglement entropy, in-in correlators/scattering) to connect microstructure to phenomenology. Analogue gravity enters as an empirical “EFT sanity check”: dispersive mode conversion and Hawking-like emission test which low-energy features are universal under UV modifications (a direct analogue of universality under RG). *(d) Predicted signatures:* Low-energy deviations appear as higher-dimension operators (modified dispersion, Lorentz-violating/curvature-coupled terms) and as specific “discreteness noise” in correlators. Targets include: cosmological correlators (running/non-Gaussianity patterns compatible with a particular EFT operator set), black-hole near-horizon two-point functions (robustness of thermality under UV dispersion, informed by analogue results), and causal-set-specific imprints such as stochastic fluctuations in propagation or entanglement-entropy corrections. Priority challenges are (i) defining a robust coarse-graining map with gauge/diffeomorphism control, and (ii) computing *observable* correlators across the flow rather than only kinematical quantities.\n\n**Framework B: Operational quantum-causal modeling with emergent classical spacetime as a decohered sector (indefinite causal order ↔ semiclassical EFT ↔ testable decoherence).** *(a) Assumptions/DOF:* Fundamental description is a network of quantum operations with no assumed global time order; “classical causal structure” is an emergent constraint when certain degrees of freedom decohere. Matter systems are open: tracing out inaccessible gravitational/spacetime degrees of freedom yields effective noise (potentially including gravity-induced dephasing). *(b) Minimal formalism:* Use a process-matrix / quantum-comb style object \\(W\\) that assigns probabilities to local instruments \\(\\{M_a\\}\\):  \n\\[\np(a,b,\\dots)=\\mathrm{Tr}\\!\\left[W\\,(M_a\\otimes M_b\\otimes \\cdots)\\right],\n\\]\nwhere classical spacetime corresponds to the subset of \\(W\\) compatible with a definite causal order. The classical limit is modeled by a coarse-graining/decoherence channel \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) on \\(W\\) (or on an underlying joint state) that suppresses interference between distinct causal/metric configurations: schematically, \\(\\rho \\mapsto \\mathcal{D}(\\rho)=\\sum_\\alpha \\Pi_\\alpha \\rho \\Pi_\\alpha\\) (or a Lindblad generator \\(\\dot\\rho=-i[H,\\rho]+\\sum_k L_k\\rho L_k^\\dagger-\\tfrac12\\{L_k^\\dagger L_k,\\rho\\}\\)). In the regime where a semiclassical metric is valid, \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) should reduce to EFT-consistent phase noise scaling with gravitational potential/time-dilation differences—precisely the kind of residual, environment-insensitive dephasing singled out in recent synthesis discussions as a discriminator against purely technical noise. *(c) Relation to pillars:* This framework absorbs the corpus trend toward operational/testable foundations (quantum causal modeling, indefinite causal order) while remaining compatible with pAQFT/AQFT locality once a classical background emerges. It also provides a common language to compare “gravity as an irreducible decoherer” proposals with conventional open-system decoherence (engineering noise), giving a clear experimental decision criterion: does decoherence persist under aggressive dynamical decoupling/error correction and scale with gravitational parameters? *(d) Predicted signatures:* Near-term signatures are laboratory-scale: differential interferometry or clock-in-superposition experiments where engineered noise is held fixed while gravitational potential differences vary; the key observable is a residual dephasing rate with the predicted gravitational scaling (and possibly a characteristic frequency dependence that distinguishes it from technical \\(1/f\\) noise). In cosmology/black holes, the same logic predicts a transition from indefinite/quantum causal structure to an effectively classical one, potentially leaving constrained forms of primordial decoherence or horizon-scale “information loss channels” that must still respect EFT locality in the emergent regime.\n\n**Framework C: Entanglement-first holographic emergence with consistency constraints (holography/string ↔ EFT ↔ swampland; optional bridge to spin-foam tensor networks).** *(a) Assumptions/DOF:* Quantum gravity is defined (where available) by a boundary quantum system; bulk geometry is an emergent encoding of boundary entanglement, and not every low-energy EFT can be UV completed (swampland constraints). Classical spacetime corresponds to code subspaces with semiclassical bulk duals. *(b) Minimal formalism:* The unifying data are (i) boundary state/entanglement structure, (ii) a bulk reconstruction map, and (iii) an error-correcting property. At the “minimal equation” level this can be summarized by entanglement/geometry relations (e.g., generalized entropy) and subregion duality: bulk region \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) boundary entanglement wedge. Semiclassical dynamics is constrained by consistency conditions like “no global symmetries” and by swampland-style bounds on EFT parameter space (e.g., towers of states over large field distances; gravity as the weakest force). *(c) Relation to pillars:* This squarely matches the corpus observation that string-based QG is dominated by holography as the sharpest nonperturbative definition and by the swampland program as a systematic filter on EFTs, with increasing attention to cosmology. Methodologically, it resonates with spin-foam/LQG tensor-network coarse graining: both treat “geometry” as emerging from entanglement/graph structure, differing mainly in whether a boundary definition is assumed. *(d) Predicted signatures:* Empirical traction is indirect but sharp: (i) cosmological model-building constraints—limits on stable de Sitter-like EFTs, characteristic correlated predictions for inflationary potentials/spectra, and expectations of additional light towers in certain regimes; (ii) black-hole information constraints—unitarity-compatible Page-curve behavior and specific patterns of entanglement wedge reconstruction; (iii) low-energy deviations that appear not as arbitrary corrections but as *forbidden regions* in EFT parameter space (e.g., restrictions on global symmetries, charge-to-mass spectra). The highest-priority challenge is translating these constraints into *quantitative, falsifiable* cosmological/astrophysical discriminants, rather than broad “no-go” statements.\n\nAcross all three sketches, the reconciliation of classical and quantum descriptions is organized around explicit maps: micro-to-macro coarse graining (Framework A), quantum-to-classical causal emergence via decoherence/operational constraints (Framework B), and entanglement-to-geometry encoding plus EFT consistency filters (Framework C). The shared technical agenda suggested by the corpus is to (1) make coarse graining mathematically controlled (RG + locality/algebraic structures), (2) compute genuinely observable correlators/entropies rather than only kinematics, and (3) attach each proposal to a small set of discriminating signatures—especially those testable in analogue platforms (robustness of Hawking-like phenomena under UV dispersion) and in precision decoherence experiments that can separate technical noise from gravity-tied channels.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## III.

Empirical Signature Portfolio and Experimental/Observational Pathways\n\nA coherent empirical portfolio for quantum-gravity candidates should be organized around *where* the different frameworks make controllably distinct claims: (i) quantum field theory (QFT) on effective curved backgrounds (including horizon kinematics), (ii) precision departures from semiclassical gravity (backreaction, decoherence, equivalence-principle and Lorentz-sector tests), (iii) early-universe initial-state and dynamical imprints (spectra, non-Gaussianities, and relic features), (iv) black-hole information recovery channels (late-time ringdown structure, echoes, and horizon-scale modifications), and (v) discrete-structure signatures (modified dispersion, spectral-dimension flow, and diffusion-like observables). The unifying methodological theme across these domains is to treat prospective quantum-gravity effects as *controlled deformations* of semiclassical effective field theory—often parameterized by dispersion corrections, nonlocality scales, additional channels of decoherence, or running effective dimensions—and then to map these deformations to measurable correlators with explicit sensitivity targets. This “EFT-plus-discriminators” approach aligns well with renormalization/coarse-graining ideas that now act as a cross-program lingua franca (e.g., background-independent coarse graining in spin foams, RG flow in asymptotic safety, and scale-dependent dimensionality in discrete approaches), allowing otherwise heterogeneous theories to be compared at the level of scaling exponents, universality classes, and symmetry-restoration patterns.\n\n**Analogue-gravity probes** provide the most direct, laboratory-controlled access to the kinematics of horizons and particle production, but must be interpreted as tests of *QFT-on-an-effective-metric* rather than direct tests of quantum gravity. Across platforms (water waves, BECs, nonlinear optics), experiments have targeted Hawking-like emission via mode conversion and correlations, including stimulated Hawking emission in water-wave analogues (PRL 2011) and widely discussed BEC claims of spontaneous Hawking radiation with correlation signatures (Nature Physics 2016). Post-2016 efforts increasingly emphasize falsifiability: verifying stationarity and separating genuine horizon-induced correlations from finite-temperature backgrounds, noise, and time-dependent transients, while also incorporating dispersive corrections and backreaction beyond the fixed-background approximation (including number-conserving and backreaction-aware treatments in BEC theory). In this portfolio, analogue experiments serve two discriminator roles: (1) *robustness tests* of Hawking/Unruh universality against UV dispersion (a proxy for “trans-Planckian” sensitivity), and (2) *systematics stress-tests* of correlation-based observables (e.g., density–density correlators) under controlled departures from ideal horizon conditions. Near-term opportunities lie in metrologically tighter correlation measurements with calibrated temperature/dispersion budgets and in protocols that vary the effective dispersion relation or horizon formation history to isolate universal features (e.g., thermality windows, partner-mode correlations) from platform-specific artifacts.\n\n**Precision semiclassical and “beyond-QFTCS” tests** form a second pathway: rather than chase Planck-suppressed effects directly, they target scenarios predicting *irreducible* deviations from unitary QFT in curved spacetime, such as gravity-linked dephasing channels, violations of local Lorentz invariance, or small equivalence-principle anomalies in quantum regimes. The key discriminator strategy is differential control: aggressively characterize technical/environmental noise (via noise spectroscopy, dynamical decoupling, and error budgeting), then vary only a gravitational parameter (height/potential difference, clock-rate shift, curvature proxy) to look for residual decoherence with the predicted scaling. This logic parallels the broader field’s push to move from qualitative “it might decohere” claims toward parameterized open-system models with identifiable spectral signatures (e.g., whether the putative gravitational noise is low-frequency and suppressible, or an irreducible channel). In parallel, discrete microstructure approaches motivate stringent Lorentz-violation searches through modified dispersion and birefringence constraints, while their internal coarse-graining programs motivate *dimension-flow* observables (e.g., spectral dimension running inferred from diffusion-like probes or effective propagation kernels). Here, the near-term empirical leverage is largely negative (tightening bounds) but highly discriminating: many discrete-structure models must either realize symmetry restoration in the continuum limit or retreat to parameter regions already pressured by high-precision constraints.\n\n**Cosmological and black-hole observables** provide the longest lever arm in energy/curvature and thus the most direct contact with “UV completion” claims, albeit at the cost of model degeneracy and astrophysical systematics. In cosmology, the signature portfolio should emphasize (i) departures from near-scale-invariant primordial spectra, (ii) characteristic shapes of non-Gaussianity, (iii) feature/oscillation templates tied to new physics scales or initial-state modifications, and (iv) consistency relations that probe whether inflationary (or alternative) dynamics are embedded in a controlled UV framework. This is where string-theory–adjacent constraints (e.g., swampland-inspired restrictions on scalar potentials or field ranges) become empirically relevant not as direct tests of strings, but as *consistency filters* that correlate otherwise independent observables (tensor-to-scalar ratio, running, non-Gaussianity amplitude/shape) and sharpen “allowed” regions of parameter space. For black holes, the most actionable program is precision gravitational-wave spectroscopy: searching for ringdown deviations, overtone structure anomalies, and (more speculatively) late-time echoes or horizon-scale modifications that would indicate departures from classical Kerr boundary conditions. The portfolio logic is to connect each putative near-horizon modification to a predicted transfer function in the ringdown/late-time waveform and to demand multi-event consistency (population-level inference) to beat down astrophysical variance. Across both cosmology and black holes, the central discriminator is not “a deviation exists,” but whether the deviation matches a *framework-typical pattern*: holographic scenarios tend to reorganize questions around boundary observables and information flow; background-independent discrete approaches often predict scale-dependent propagation (dimension flow, nonlocal kernels) and require demonstrable symmetry recovery; and semiclassical-plus-open-system models emphasize specific decoherence scalings and correlation-loss channels. The immediate deliverable for the program is therefore a mapping from candidate frameworks to (a) the minimal set of observables that break degeneracies, (b) the sensitivity threshold where each effect becomes testable, and (c) a prioritized sequence of near-term measurements—analogue correlation benchmarks, precision decoherence differentials, Lorentz-sector bounds, and multi-event ringdown inference—that can most rapidly eliminate broad classes of mechanisms while remaining interpretable within a shared EFT/coarse-grained language.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## IV. DEVELOPMENT ROADMAPS, PRIORITY CHALLENGES, AND DECISION TABLE\n\n## IV. Development Roadmaps, Priority Challenges, and Decision Table\n\n### Candidate A: **Holographic/String-Theoretic UV Completions (AdS/CFT + Swampland-Constrained EFT)**\n**Prioritized theoretical challenges.** (1) **Recovery of GR+SM:** sharpen the map from specific compactifications/dual CFT data to realistic low-energy spectra and couplings, including moduli stabilization and hierarchies. (2) **Continuum limit:** while holography is nonperturbative where defined, the “continuum” issue reappears as the emergence of a semiclassical bulk from large‑N, strong-coupling CFT data and controlling \\(1/N\\) and \\(\\alpha'\\) corrections. (3) **Background independence:** the dual QFT definition is background-fixed in a boundary sense; the open problem is a truly general, background-agnostic formulation beyond known asymptotics. (4) **Unitarity/causality:** mostly a strength (unitarity is built in), but the challenge is reconstructing bulk locality/causal structure from boundary correlators and entanglement, and delimiting when locality fails. (5) **Anomaly cancellation:** comparatively mature (string consistency is tightly constrained), but realistic models must still satisfy detailed anomaly constraints after symmetry breaking. (6) **Computational tractability:** extracting cosmology and real-world observables from strongly coupled QFTs and complex compactifications remains the bottleneck.  \n**Stepwise roadmap.** (i) Consolidate a “minimal predictive pipeline” from swampland constraints \\(\\rightarrow\\) admissible EFT classes \\(\\rightarrow\\) cosmological/particle signatures, treating conjectures as falsifiable hypotheses rather than axioms. (ii) Use holography as a controlled laboratory to derive bulk emergence diagnostics (entanglement wedges, modular flow) and quantify corrections to semiclassical gravity. (iii) Couple the pipeline to near-term empirical hooks: early-universe consistency relations, constraints on scalar potentials (inflation/quintessence), and precision tests sensitive to light fields/moduli. (iv) Iterate via failure modes: if swampland constraints prove too restrictive or inconsistent with data, refine or discard specific conjectures while retaining robust consistency constraints (no global symmetries, completeness).\n\n### Candidate B: **Background-Independent Discrete/Microscopic Spacetime with RG/Coarse-Graining (LQG/Spin Foams/GFT/CDT + Causal-Set QFT Observables)**\n**Prioritized theoretical challenges.** (1) **Continuum limit (top priority):** demonstrate that a controlled coarse-graining/renormalization flow yields a universal semiclassical phase with local Lorentzian geometry and the Einstein equations (or a well-defined deformation). The 2019–2025 synthesis trend explicitly elevates **RG/coarse graining as the unifying thread** across these approaches. (2) **Recovery of GR+SM:** obtain the correct graviton propagator/low-energy amplitudes and incorporate realistic matter (chiral fermions, gauge sectors) without ad hoc tuning. (3) **Unitarity/causality:** discrete dynamics must reproduce causal propagation and avoid pathological nonlocality; causal-set programs, in particular, prioritize QFT observables (entanglement entropy, in-in correlators/scattering) to make these questions calculational. (4) **Anomaly cancellation:** ensure that discretization and quantization preserve gauge consistency (including potential gravitational anomalies in effective matter sectors). (5) **Background independence:** typically a strength (no fixed geometry), but it becomes a challenge when defining observables, time, and S-matrix notions. (6) **Computational tractability:** coarse-graining flows and large-state-sum evaluations are expensive; progress depends on effective truncations, tensor-network methods, and benchmark observables.  \n**Stepwise roadmap.** (i) Define benchmark observables that survive discretization and can be compared across models (two-point functions, entanglement diagnostics, causal response functions), leveraging the causal-set push toward **predictive QFT-on-discrete-structures**. (ii) Build and validate RG/coarse-graining machinery that identifies fixed points/phases and quantifies universality (what details do *not* matter in the IR). (iii) Demonstrate semiclassical spacetime emergence in a regime where matter can be coupled consistently; require recovery of GR at long distances as a non-negotiable milestone rather than an aspiration. (iv) Only after a stable semiclassical phase is established, invest heavily in SM-like matter embedding and precision phenomenology (Lorentz-violation bounds, dispersion, cosmological signatures). (v) Cross-calibrate with continuum EFT expectations to prevent “interpretive drift”: every new discrete ingredient must come with an RG/observable justification.\n\n### Candidate C: **Operational/Open-System Quantum Gravity Interface (Decoherence + Indefinite Causal Structure as Test-First Constraints)**\n**Prioritized theoretical challenges.** (1) **Unitarity vs. effective non-unitarity:** reconcile standard unitary quantum theory with the possibility of an *irreducible* gravity-linked dephasing channel (the key tension: “all decoherence is engineering” vs “gravity-induced residual decoherence”). (2) **Causality:** formulate consistent notions of causal influence/no-signaling when causal structure may be indefinite, while keeping predictions operationally testable. (3) **Recovery of GR+SM:** derive when and how classical spacetime and QFT on curved spacetime emerge as effective descriptions of underlying quantum/operational constraints. (4) **Background independence:** encode gravitational effects through relational observables (clock/time dilation degrees of freedom) rather than fixed background metrics. (5) **Anomaly cancellation:** not central at the outset, but any coupling to gauge/matter sectors must respect standard consistency constraints. (6) **Computational tractability:** the advantage here is model-building in terms of noise channels, filter functions, and open-system master equations that are directly comparable to experiment.  \n**Stepwise roadmap.** (i) Execute the high-ROI experimental logic recommended by the 2019–2025 consistency synthesis: **(a)** do noise spectroscopy and aggressive dynamical decoupling/error mitigation first; **(b)** only then search for a residual decoherence channel that is insensitive to engineering controls. (ii) Design differential tests where local environment is fixed while gravitational parameters vary (height/potential difference, “clock in superposition,” mass-superposition interferometry), explicitly targeting the proposed scaling laws (e.g., dependence on gravitational potential differences). (iii) Develop quantitative open-system models coupling matter to semiclassical gravity and predict not just rates but *spectral structure*—crucial for deciding whether control sequences can suppress the effect. (iv) If a reproducible residual is found, elevate it into a constraint on candidate microtheories (Candidates A/B): any viable theory must reproduce (or robustly exclude) the observed channel while preserving no-signaling and controlled limits.\n\n---\n\n### Decision Table (1 = low, 5 = high)\nScores are meant to guide portfolio decisions rather than declare winners; “resource requirements” is scored as **burden** (5 = most expensive).\n\n| Candidate | Feasibility (5=near-term progress) | Novelty / Unification leverage | Testability (near-term empirical hooks) | Resource requirements (5=highest) | Key near-term deliverable |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|\n| A.

Operational/Open-system + Gravity-sensitive decoherence tests | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | Differential experiment + validated noise model that cleanly separates technical vs residual decoherence |\n\n---\n\n### Recommended sequencing of research investments (portfolio logic)\n1) **Lead with Candidate C (test-first, cross-cutting):** it offers the fastest path to discriminating signals—by turning “quantum-gravity interface” questions into measurable residual-decoherence benchmarks after state-of-the-art noise suppression. Even null results are valuable because they set quantitative constraints that Candidates A and B must respect.  \n2) **Parallel core theory in Candidate B (RG/coarse-graining as the spine):** invest steadily in continuum-limit/coarse-graining infrastructure and in QFT observables on discrete structures, because this is the gating item for any background-independent microtheory to become predictive.  \n3) **Targeted bets in Candidate A (where dual control exists):** prioritize holographic calculations and swampland-to-EFT translation only where they produce hard constraints or clear cosmology-facing signatures. Avoid over-allocating to conjecture exploration without explicit falsifiable outputs.  \n\nOverall, the recommended program treats **RG/coarse-graining and operational benchmarks** as the shared “currency” across approaches: Candidate C supplies near-term falsification pressure and noise-model discipline; Candidate B supplies the emergence/continuum machinery needed for a full background-independent theory; Candidate A supplies the sharpest nonperturbative definitions in special settings and a consistency-constraint engine that can rapidly prune implausible low-energy scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Micro-to-macro mechanism for spacetime emergence — The corpus identifies entanglement structures and emergent degrees of freedom as central motifs, but lacks a concrete, dynamical microphysical model (Hamiltonian or path-integral measure) and a precise coarse-graining / renormalization map that produces Lorentzian classical spacetime with Einstein dynamics.

Independent programs repeatedly converge on common mathematical infrastructure: constrained Hamiltonian systems and diffeomorphism invariance (separating physical from gauge degrees of freedom), effective field theory (EFT) as the organizing principle for low‑energy universality, and information‑theoretic structures—especially entanglement and quantum error‑correction—as candidates for the “glue” from which geometric notions (distance, connectivity, horizons) arise. In this view, “quantizing GR” is reframed as identifying the correct microscopic variables and flow to an infrared fixed point that reproduces GR+QFT on curved spacetime, while maintaining consistency constraints (anomalies, unitarity/causality, UV completion conditions) that sharply restrict viable theories.\n\nFrom these motifs, 2–3 unifying sketches recur as the most actionable: (A) holographic/string UV completions where bulk gravity is reconstructed from boundary quantum data, constrained by swampland consistency and yielding characteristic correlations among EFT parameters; (B) background‑independent, discretized or algebraic approaches (spin foams/LQG, causal sets, group field theory) where continuum geometry appears as a coarse‑grained phase with specific signatures of discretization or modified propagation; and (C) entanglement‑/tensor‑network induced gravity where geometry and dynamics track entropic and error‑correcting properties of underlying quantum states, predicting structured deviations in entropy laws and correlation functions. Empirically, the portfolio prioritizes tests where frameworks make separable claims: precision “EFT of gravity” consistency checks (including quantum corrections and equivalence‑principle bounds), horizon/entanglement diagnostics (black‑hole spectroscopy, gravitational‑wave ringdown structure, and quantum‑information constraints on evaporation), and potential discreteness/modified‑dispersion signals in high‑energy astrophysical timing and cosmological relics. The highest‑leverage theoretical challenges are: deriving GR+SM with controlled approximations and error bars, defining robust observables in background‑independent settings, proving the correct renormalization flow to the classical limit, and producing discriminating predictions that survive universality and parameter degeneracies.","sectionsGenerated":8,"sourcesConsulted":11,"knowledgeGaps":["Gap 1: Micro-to-macro mechanism for spacetime emergence — The corpus identifies entanglement structures and emergent degrees of freedom as central motifs, but lacks a concrete, dynamical microphysical model (Hamiltonian or path-integral measure) and a precise coarse-graining / renormalization map that produces Lorentzian classical spacetime with Einstein dynamics.

Formalize regimes and assumptions: explicitly state which degrees of freedom (worldsheet CFT, boundary QFT, large-N gauge theory, or engineered qubits) are intended in each mapping and identify the parametric limits (N, coupling, energy scale) where the entanglement→geometry reconstruction is expected to hold.\n  2. Develop toy models connecting turbulence-like cascades to RG/entanglement flows in controlled 2D QFTs. Start with solvable or numerically tractable CFTs deformed by relevant operators to test whether scale-to-scale energy transfer can be framed as operator mixing with measurable entanglement signatures.\n  3.

Perform holographic/numerical checks: compute the proposed diagnostics (entanglement structure, mutual information patterns, response to quenches) in known holographic models and in lattice/DMRG/tensor-network approximations to the same field theories to see which features are robust and which require stringy structure.\n  5. Build minimal string-inspired models where a worldsheet RG picture of cascades can be analyzed; ensure these models admit a clear map to a spacetime dual so predictions can be compared.\n- Experimental path (feasible tests)\n  6. Design quantum-simulator experiments targeting universal entanglement features predicted by holographic toy models (mutual information localization, entanglement growth after quenches, specific entanglement spectrum fingerprints). Focus on regimes accessible experimentally (moderate system sizes, well-characterized Hamiltonians) and on observables robust to finite-N effects.\n  7. Use tensor-network and machine-learning reconstruction pipelines to infer emergent connectivity/curvature from simulator data; quantify uncertainties and benchmark reconstruction against synthetic data from known holographic states.\n- Meta recommendation (coordination)\n  8.

From these, propose 2–3 candidate unified frameworks (sketches) that map how classical and quantum descriptions could be reconciled under specific assumptions; provide formal outlines (equations, key variables), expected empirical signatures, and prioritized theoretical challenges.\n\n**Generated:** 2025-12-22T19:03:23.294Z\n**Sources:** 10 memory nodes\n**Sections:** 8\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAcross the curated corpus, the dominant unifying theme is that **symmetry is a structural constraint**—realized as gauge redundancy, diffeomorphism invariance, and constraint algebras—rather than an optional aesthetic. Closely linked motifs include **effective field theory logic** (separating universal infrared behavior from UV details), **renormalization/coarse-graining** as the core bridge between micro- and macro-descriptions, and **quantum-information structure** (entanglement patterns, tensor-network-like factorizations, and error-correcting properties) as the organizing principle behind emergent geometry. In this view, classical spacetime and gravity arise as **collective, semiclassical variables**—e.g., geometric operators and hydrodynamic-like fields—whose consistency is enforced by symmetry constraints and whose dynamics is stabilized by RG fixed points or universality classes.\n\nThe report’s key synthesis insight is that the most credible reconciliation strategy between classical and quantum descriptions is to make **coarse-graining/RG flow explicit**, mapping microscopic quantum degrees of freedom to macroscopic geometric observables while preserving gauge constraints and locality in an emergent sense. This yields 2–3 viable candidate framework sketches: (i) **entanglement-to-geometry constructions** (geometry as an information-theoretic order parameter), (ii) **RG-driven emergent gravity** (Einstein-like dynamics as an IR fixed-point effective theory), and (iii) **constraint-first quantization/coarse-graining hybrids** (ensuring the correct symmetry/constraint algebra survives discretization and continuum limits). Empirically, the corpus converges on targeting **operational signatures**—small deviations from classical propagation, universality-violating corrections, horizon/entropy relations, and cosmological imprints—while prioritizing a short list of gating theoretical challenges: defining robust observables in generally covariant settings, proving controlled continuum limits under coarse-graining, and demonstrating that emergent locality/causality and semiclassical Einstein dynamics arise without fine-tuning.\n\n---\n\n## 1) CROSS-CORPUS MOTIFS: SHARED MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES AND CONCEPTUAL INVARIANTS\n\n## 1) Cross-Corpus Motifs: Shared Mathematical Structures and Conceptual Invariants\n\nAcross the corpus, the strongest conceptual invariants are symmetry principles—implemented as redundancies, constraints, and consistency conditions rather than optional aesthetic features. In canonical loop quantum gravity (LQG), the shift to Ashtekar connection variables recasts gravity as a constrained gauge system: the basic fields are an SU(2) connection \\(A^i_a\\) and a densitized triad \\(E^a_i\\), with dynamics enforced by first-class constraints. Canonically one tracks the Gauss constraint \\(G_i \\approx 0\\) (internal SU(2) gauge redundancy), the spatial diffeomorphism constraint \\(V_a \\approx 0\\), and the Hamiltonian constraint \\(H \\approx 0\\), encoding refoliation invariance. The “seminal sequence” (Ashtekar; Rovelli–Smolin; Ashtekar–Isham; Ashtekar–Lewandowski) established a rigorous holonomy/loop-algebra representation: holonomies \\(h_e[A]=\\mathcal{P}\\exp\\int_e A\\) and fluxes \\(E(S,f)=\\int_S f_i E^a_i n_a\\) become the nonperturbative kinematical variables, with spin networks furnishing a diffeomorphism-covariant basis and yielding discrete spectra for geometric operators (area/volume). In string/holographic approaches, the same motif appears as “no global symmetries” and anomaly/consistency constraints on the boundary theory, with bulk diffeomorphism invariance mirrored by boundary gauge redundancies and Ward identities. In swampland framing, would-be low-energy EFTs are filtered by consistency conditions (e.g., no global symmetries, distance/weak gravity constraints), functioning as symmetry-informed selection rules on admissible effective descriptions. The shared invariant is that “physical states” are equivalence classes under gauge/diffeomorphism actions, and dynamics is organized around constraint algebras or their dual Ward identities—different languages enforcing the same requirement: redundancy must not leak into observables.\n\nA second cross-cutting motif is entanglement as a geometric and thermodynamic organizing principle, even when the microscopic degrees of freedom differ. In holography, entanglement entropy is tied directly to bulk geometry via the Ryu–Takayanagi/HRT relation,\n\\[\nS(A)=\\frac{\\mathrm{Area}(\\gamma_A)}{4G_N}+S_{\\text{bulk}}(\\Sigma_A),\n\\]\nwith the modular Hamiltonian \\(K_A=-\\log\\rho_A\\) and entanglement wedge reconstruction encoding a precise “information-theoretic” notion of bulk locality. The corpus highlights an actionable route: studying relevant deformations away from strict CFT fixed points to track how changes in boundary entanglement data map to bulk metric perturbations—effectively using \\(\\delta S\\) and modular response to diagnose emergent geometry. In background-independent settings (LQG/spin foams, causal sets), entanglement enters more implicitly but with the same structural role: geometric observables (e.g., area operators in LQG) behave like “surface data” that naturally couple to boundary/region factorization, while causal-set progress explicitly targets QFT observables on discrete substrates, including entanglement entropy and in-in correlators, to connect microstructure to continuum phenomenology. The common invariant is an “area-law/edge-mode” pattern: whenever gauge constraints prevent naive tensor factorization, physically meaningful entanglement is organized by boundary degrees of freedom (or their discrete analogues), and entropy-like quantities become probes of emergent geometric or causal structure.\n\nRenormalization and coarse-graining form the third unifying spine, repeatedly invoked (including in cross-program editorials) as the technical bridge between microscopic discreteness and semiclassical continuity. In holography, RG flow is geometrized (radial direction as scale), with fixed points corresponding to AdS asymptotics and relevant deformations driving flows away from conformality. In spin-foam LQG (2018–2025), the emphasis shifts from kinematics to continuum recovery via background-independent renormalization: one coarse-grains amplitudes on foams/2-complexes and looks for fixed points and universality classes where effective diffeomorphism symmetry is restored, often using tensor-network-inspired methods to control the coarse-graining map. In causal sets, analogous “manifold emergence” questions are posed as dynamical suppression of non-manifold-like orders, i.e., a coarse-graining/selection mechanism on the space of discrete structures. The shared formal template is Wilsonian: define an effective action or effective amplitude \\(S_\\Lambda\\) (or an effective transfer map) at scale \\(\\Lambda\\), evolve it under an RG transformation \\( \\Lambda \\partial_\\Lambda g_i = \\beta_i(\\{g\\})\\), and diagnose continuum physics by fixed points, relevant directions, and universal long-distance observables. Even when the “couplings” are not standard local operators (e.g., spin-foam face/edge weights, causal-set nonlocal kernels), the motif remains: consistent macroscopic gravity requires a controlled flow toward a universality class reproducing approximate locality, Lorentz/diffeomorphism symmetry, and the correct low-energy degrees of freedom.\n\nThese motifs converge into a shared effective-field-theory (EFT) logic of emergence: whatever the UV completion, low-energy predictions are organized by operator expansions, cutoff dependence, and decoupling—plus a hydrodynamic limit where collective variables dominate. In string/swampland discourse, the EFT is constrained by UV consistency (the “landscape vs swampland” filter), while in LQG/spin foams the EFT problem appears as deriving an effective continuum action and graviton-like excitations from discrete quantum geometry (including earlier work connecting to Fock-space/graviton regimes). In analogue-gravity experiments, the same emergence logic is operationalized: Hawking-like signals are interrogated for robustness under dispersion, finite temperature, and nonstationarity—i.e., which features are universal IR predictions versus UV-sensitive artifacts of the medium. The cross-corpus invariant is a two-stage pipeline: (i) identify the correct collective observables (geometry from holonomies/fluxes; bulk distances from boundary entanglement; causal relations from order structure; phonon metrics from condensate flow), and (ii) show that their long-wavelength dynamics is governed by a small set of relevant parameters, largely independent of microscopic details.\n\n### Motif-to-Formalism Map (key variables and canonical equations)\n\n| Motif | Representative formalisms | Key variables | Canonical equations/relations (schematic) | What stays invariant across approaches |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Gauge redundancy & constraints | Canonical GR/LQG; boundary gauge theories in holography; swampland consistency | LQG: \\(A^i_a, E^a_i\\); states as equivalence classes; boundary currents/charges | Constraints: \\(G_i\\approx0,\\; V_a\\approx0,\\; H\\approx0\\).

The corpus thus points to a practical synthesis strategy: align each approach’s native variables (holonomies/fluxes; boundary density matrices/modular operators; causal order relations; medium excitations) with the same triad of diagnostics—constraint consistency, entanglement structure, and RG fixed-point behavior—so that “emergent gravity” becomes a comparably testable statement across otherwise incommensurate formalisms.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 2) FROM MICROSCOPIC QUANTUM INFORMATION TO MACROSCOPIC GEOMETRY: MECHANISMS OF EMERGENCE\n\n### 2) From Microscopic Quantum Information to Macroscopic Geometry: Mechanisms of Emergence\n\nA convergent theme across modern quantum-gravity programs is that *classical spacetime is not fundamental*, but an effective description of underlying quantum degrees of freedom organized by entanglement and coarse graining. The sharpest nonperturbative arena for this idea is holography (AdS/CFT): a quantum many-body theory without gravity (the “boundary” QFT) can encode a higher-dimensional gravitational bulk in which distances and causal structure are readable from quantum-information data. In this picture, geometric quantities become functionals of the boundary state—most prominently via the Ryu–Takayanagi/HRT relation, where the entanglement entropy \\(S(A)\\) of a boundary region \\(A\\) is computed by an extremal bulk surface \\(\\gamma_A\\), \\(S(A)=\\mathrm{Area}(\\gamma_A)/(4G_N)+S_{\\text{bulk}}(\\Sigma_A)\\). This provides a direct entanglement-to-geometry dictionary: changing the entanglement pattern changes the bulk area functional and hence the effective metric. A concrete, actionable route (and one that remains robust beyond strictly conformal settings) is to study *relevant deformations* of holographic CFTs: by computing entanglement entropies and RT/HRT surface shifts in nonconformal “AdS/CFT-like” toy models, one can explicitly map how particular entanglement perturbations correspond to specific bulk metric perturbations, thereby turning the slogan “entanglement builds geometry” into a calculable kernel from boundary data to bulk fields.\n\nMechanistically, the emergence pipeline can be organized into intermediate scales where approximations enter. **(i) Microscopic layer (UV):** a lattice/field-theoretic quantum system with Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal H\\), local operator algebra, and a state \\(\\rho\\) (pure or mixed). **(ii) Information-theoretic coarse graining:** choose a family of subregions \\(A\\) and compute entanglement/relative-entropy data \\(\\{S(A),\\, S(\\rho_A\\|\\sigma_A)\\}\\) with respect to a reference state \\(\\sigma\\) (often the vacuum). This step already assumes an operational split into subsystems and a notion of “simple” observables. **(iii) Renormalization/geometry layer:** apply an entanglement RG (e.g., MERA-like constructions) or a quantum error-correction viewpoint to build an emergent bulk where *scale* corresponds to RG depth; tensor networks serve as discrete geometries in which graph connectivity and bond dimensions encode entanglement structure. Here, geometry is approximate: the network defines a coarse metric and causal structure only for a restricted code subspace and a limited class of low-complexity operators. **(iv) Semiclassical continuum limit:** when the state has large effective central charge/large-\\(N\\) structure, sparse low-dimension spectrum, and a large gap to stringy/UV modes, the discrete bulk can be approximated by a smooth manifold with a local effective action. This is the stage at which a classical metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) becomes a good variable, and corrections organize via \\(1/N\\), higher-derivative terms, and quantum extremal surface contributions \\(S_{\\text{bulk}}\\). **(v) Macroscopic gravity/thermodynamics:** at long distances and after additional coarse graining (often tracing over microscopic bulk matter and high-frequency metric modes), gravitational dynamics can be rewritten in thermodynamic language, where entropy functionals and coarse-grained energy flux control effective equations of motion; this is the regime where “entropic gravity” intuitions apply, but only as an emergent rewriting of underlying microscopic unitary dynamics rather than a fundamental modification.\n\nWithin this pipeline, there is now a fairly crisp set of assumptions under which *semiclassical Einstein equations* can be derived (or strongly constrained) from quantum-information identities. A standard route uses the **entanglement first law**—for small perturbations around a reference state, \\(\\delta S_A=\\delta\\langle K_A\\rangle\\), where \\(K_A\\) is the modular Hamiltonian of \\(\\sigma_A\\)—together with **relative entropy positivity/monotonicity**, \\(S(\\rho_A\\|\\sigma_A)\\ge 0\\) and its behavior under inclusion. For ball-shaped regions in the vacuum of a relativistic QFT, \\(K_A\\) is local, so \\(\\delta\\langle K_A\\rangle\\) becomes an integral of the stress tensor; via the RT relation, \\(\\delta S_A\\) becomes a linearized area variation determined by \\(\\delta g_{\\mu\\nu}\\). Matching these two sides across all such regions enforces the **linearized Einstein equation** with appropriate boundary conditions, while stronger constraints from relative entropy for nested regions and modular flow support the extension toward nonlinear dynamics in a code subspace where bulk locality holds. Conceptually, the key approximation is *state restriction*: one assumes a semiclassical sector in which modular flow is sufficiently “coarse-grained local” (or approximated by local boosts near entangling surfaces), bulk fields satisfy effective equations, and gravitational constraints behave like consistency conditions ensuring that entanglement wedges glue into a single geometry. Outside this sector—e.g., highly excited states with strong backreaction, large quantum extremal surface fluctuations, or nonlocal modular Hamiltonians—the mapping becomes state-dependent and the Einstein description can fail or require nonlocal corrections.\n\nTensor networks and thermodynamic gravity ideas provide complementary intuition for *why* this works and where it breaks. Tensor networks (MERA, random tensor networks, and holographic quantum error-correcting codes) make the emergence visually and computationally explicit: locality in the bulk corresponds to approximately correctable operator reconstruction, while minimal cuts through the network reproduce RT-like area laws and identify “bulk distance” with entanglement cost. In parallel, entropic/thermodynamic approaches reinterpret gravitational dynamics as coarse-grained constraints on information flow—e.g., relating energy flux through local Rindler horizons to entropy variations—highlighting that Einstein’s equation can be viewed as an equation of state for a particular universality class of quantum matter coupled to emergent geometry. The synthesis point is that these are not competing mechanisms but different projections of the same hierarchy: microscopic entanglement patterns (UV) \\(\\rightarrow\\) RG/tensor-network coarse graining (mesoscopic geometry) \\(\\rightarrow\\) semiclassical code subspace with RT/HRT (continuum geometry) \\(\\rightarrow\\) entanglement first law + relative entropy constraints (Einstein dynamics) \\(\\rightarrow\\) further coarse graining (thermodynamic/entropic rewriting). A near-term program that operationalizes this synthesis is to compute entanglement diagnostics and RT/HRT responses in deformed holographic models (nonconformal flows), extract explicit entanglement-to-metric response functions, and then test how those kernels are reproduced (or modified) by tensor-network coarse graining—pinpointing, step by step, where large-\\(N\\), locality of modular flow, and semiclassicality enter as the decisive approximations.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 3) CANDIDATE UNIFIED FRAMEWORK SKETCHES (2–3): FORMAL OUTLINES, MAPPINGS, AND INTERNAL CONSISTENCY CHECKS\n\n### 3) Candidate Unified Framework Sketches (2–3): Formal Outlines, Mappings, and Internal Consistency Checks\n\nAcross otherwise divergent quantum-gravity programs, the most robust “reconciliation lever” is **explicit coarse-graining/RG flow**: start from microscopic degrees of freedom (DoF) that need not look geometric, and demand that under controlled coarse-graining one recovers (i) an effective geometric description with (approximate) diffeomorphism symmetry and (ii) **QFT in curved spacetime** as the matter sector on that emergent background. This section therefore presents three “framework cards” that make the classical↔quantum mapping explicit via: (A) a continuum effective action with an RG scale (background independence replaced by split-symmetry control), (B) a holographic/entanglement-to-geometry map (gravity as entanglement dynamics), and (C) a discrete causal-order substrate with continuum QFT observables as targets (causal-set style), each with internal consistency checks (unitarity, causality/locality, anomaly control) and clear failure modes. The translation layer’s common anchor is used throughout: **RG/coarse-graining is the cross-community technical bridge from microstructure to semiclassical limits**.\n\n**Framework Card A — “RG-complete Effective Geometry” (EFT ↔ Asymptotic-safety-style flow):**  \n**DoF:** a (coarse-grained) metric field \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and matter fields \\(\\phi\\), treated via a scale-dependent effective action \\(\\Gamma_k[g,\\phi;\\bar g]\\) (with background \\(\\bar g\\) used only as an intermediate device). **Dynamical principle:** RG-improved stationary action \\(\\delta \\Gamma_k/\\delta g=0\\), \\(\\delta \\Gamma_k/\\delta\\phi=0\\), with scale evolution governed by a functional RG equation of Wetterich type,\n\\[\n\\partial_k \\Gamma_k \\;=\\; \\tfrac12 \\mathrm{Tr}\\Big[(\\Gamma_k^{(2)}+R_k)^{-1}\\,\\partial_k R_k\\Big],\n\\]\nwhere \\(R_k\\) is an IR regulator and \\(\\Gamma_k^{(2)}\\) the Hessian. **Classical↔quantum mapping:** classical GR corresponds to the IR regime where \\(\\Gamma_{k\\to 0}\\) is well-approximated by a local derivative expansion (e.g. Einstein–Hilbert + higher-curvature corrections), while “quantum spacetime” is encoded in the full trajectory \\(\\{\\Gamma_k\\}_{k}\\) and its fixed points/critical surface. **Limit to GR + QFT in curved spacetime:** (i) take \\(k\\to 0\\) to obtain an effective action with renormalized couplings; (ii) expand \\(\\Gamma_{0}[g,\\phi]\\) around a semiclassical solution \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\rm sc}\\) to recover QFT on \\((M,g^{\\rm sc})\\) with higher-dimension operators suppressed by the RG scale/Planckian thresholds. **Consistency requirements:** (1) **unitarity**: absence of ghosts/tachyons in the effective spectrum (especially if higher-curvature terms become important); (2) **causality/locality**: controlled nonlocalities generated by RG flow must remain compatible with microcausality in the QFT-in-curved-spacetime limit; (3) **(effective) background independence**: regulator/background artifacts must be tamed via split-symmetry/modified Ward identities; (4) **anomaly control**: diffeomorphism/Weyl anomalies must match between matter+gravity sectors. **RG/coarse-graining implementation:** literal integration of modes above/below \\(k\\), yielding scale-dependent couplings \\(G(k),\\Lambda(k),\\dots\\). **Failure modes:** (a) no suitable fixed point/trajectory giving a predictive IR; (b) regulator/background dependence does not wash out; (c) RG-generated higher-derivative terms yield unitarity violations; (d) semiclassical limit fails to reproduce stable QFT-in-curved-spacetime behavior (e.g., uncontrolled nonlocal dissipation).\n\n**Framework Card B — “Entanglement/Operator Data → Bulk Geometry” (Holography/induced gravity sketch):**  \n**DoF:** boundary quantum DoF (density matrix \\(\\rho\\), operator algebra \\(\\mathcal A\\), and entanglement structure), with bulk fields \\((g_{\\mu\\nu},\\Phi)\\) emergent. **Dynamical principle:** a dictionary equating generating functionals, schematically \\(Z_{\\text{bulk}}[g,\\Phi]\\approx Z_{\\text{QFT}}[J]\\), with geometry determined by constraints on entanglement and correlation functions. A central structural equation is the Ryu–Takayanagi/quantum extremal surface relation (as a mapping rule rather than a derived identity in this sketch),\n\\[\nS(A)\\;=\\;\\frac{\\mathrm{Area}(\\gamma_A)}{4G_N}\\;+\\;S_{\\text{bulk}}(\\Sigma_A)\\;+\\cdots,\n\\]\nlinking boundary entanglement entropy \\(S(A)\\) to bulk geometric data. **Classical↔quantum mapping:** classical spacetime corresponds to large-\\(N\\)/strong-coupling (or otherwise “geometric”) regimes where entanglement organizes into a smooth metric; quantum gravity corresponds to \\(1/N\\) and bulk-entanglement corrections in \\(S_{\\text{bulk}}\\) and higher-point operator data. **Limit to GR + QFT in curved spacetime:** (i) in the regime where a semiclassical bulk exists, the bulk effective dynamics reduce to Einstein equations with quantum corrections, while (ii) bulk matter correlators reproduce QFT in curved spacetime on that emergent background; operationally, one checks that bulk low-energy correlators satisfy local QFT axioms to the needed approximation. **Consistency requirements:** (1) **unitarity**: boundary theory unitarity must map to bulk information conservation (including black-hole evaporation channels in settings where they are modelable); (2) **causality/locality**: boundary operator commutators and entanglement wedge reconstruction must yield an approximately local bulk causal structure in the semiclassical regime; (3) **anomaly matching**: boundary anomalies (e.g. stress-tensor Ward identities) must match bulk constraint equations; (4) **effective background independence**: geometry is not fixed but reconstructed from state-dependent data (replacing background independence with “state-dependent emergence”). **RG/coarse-graining implementation:** boundary RG flow (including relevant deformations) corresponds to radial/scale evolution of bulk geometry; coarse-graining entanglement (e.g. integrating out UV modes) changes the effective bulk metric and couplings. **Failure modes:** (a) emergence is limited to special classes of dual pairs, leaving generic spacetimes uncovered; (b) locality breaks down outside code-subspace regimes; (c) reconstruction becomes state-dependent in a way that obstructs a global bulk description; (d) nontrivial cosmological (e.g. dS-like) regimes are not captured without additional structure.\n\n**Framework Card C — “Discrete Causal Order → Continuum Fields” (Causal-set–style QFT observables as targets):**  \n**DoF:** a locally finite partially ordered set \\((C,\\prec)\\) encoding causal relations, possibly with additional labels/fields \\(\\varphi: C\\to \\mathbb R\\) for matter. **Dynamical principle:** a sum-over-histories (or stochastic growth) over causal orders weighted by an action \\(S[C]\\) and matter action \\(S_{\\text{m}}[\\varphi,C]\\),\n\\[\n\\mathcal Z \\;=\\;\\sum_{C}\\int \\mathcal D\\varphi\\;\\exp\\!\\big(iS[C]+iS_{\\text m}[\\varphi,C]\\big),\n\\]\nwith continuum physics recovered from typical coarse-grained configurations. **Classical↔quantum mapping:** classical spacetime corresponds to causal sets approximating Lorentzian manifolds under appropriate embedding/sprinkling conditions; quantum behavior is encoded in fluctuations over orders and in matter-field path integrals defined directly on the discrete causal structure. **Limit to GR + QFT in curved spacetime:** (i) identify a regime where the order approximates a smooth \\((M,g)\\) (recovering an effective d’Alembertian/propagator and approximate locality); (ii) compute **QFT observables explicitly emphasized in the corpus**—entanglement entropy and in-in correlators/scattering—directly on the causal set and show they converge to their curved-spacetime counterparts under refinement/coarse-graining. **Consistency requirements:** (1) **unitarity**: the discrete in-in (Schwinger–Keldysh) construction must yield consistent probability conservation; (2) **causality**: fundamental order enforces causal precedence, but one must show emergent microcausality and controlled lightcone fluctuations; (3) **(effective) diffeomorphism invariance**: replaced by label-independence/order-invariance of the measure and observables; (4) **anomaly control**: discrete definitions of stress-energy and its conservation must reproduce continuum Ward identities in the limit. **RG/coarse-graining implementation:** coarse-graining is defined as thinning/decimation or blockings of the poset (integrating out elements while preserving large-scale order properties), tracking flows of effective couplings in \\(S[C]\\) and of matter correlators. **Failure modes:** (a) non-manifoldlike phases dominate the sum, preventing GR recovery; (b) Lorentz symmetry/locality fail to emerge at acceptable scales; (c) entanglement/correlator targets do not converge to QFT-in-curved-spacetime values; (d) defining a predictive, computable measure over \\(C\\) remains intractable.\n\nTaken together, these sketches emphasize a shared internal logic: (i) specify micro/meso DoF; (ii) provide a principled dynamics (action/Hamiltonian/constraint or reconstruction rule); (iii) implement coarse-graining/RG as the bridge to emergent geometry; and (iv) demand hard consistency checks (unitarity, causality, anomaly matching, and an explicit semiclassical limit yielding GR + QFT in curved spacetime). The frameworks differ mainly in what is taken as fundamental—fields on a continuum with RG completion (A), entanglement/operator data with geometric dual (B), or discrete causal order with continuum observables as convergence targets (C)—and therefore in where they are most likely to fail (respectively: regulator/background artifacts and ghosts; limited duality class and locality breakdown; dominance of non-manifoldlike phases and poor continuum convergence).\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 4) EMPIRICAL SIGNATURES AND PRIORITY CHALLENGES: WHAT TO MEASURE, WHAT TO PROVE\n\n## 4) Empirical Signatures and Priority Challenges: What to Measure, What to Prove\n\nA productive synthesis strategy is to translate “emergence/quantization of geometry” frameworks into *operationally defined observables* and then rank theoretical obstacles by (i) how directly they gate contact with data and (ii) tractability. Empirically, the near-term landscape splits into three complementary windows. **Analogue-gravity platforms** (BECs, water waves, optics, and related media) already deliver controlled tests of *QFT on effective curved backgrounds*: horizon-induced mode conversion, approximate thermality, and correlation structures that mimic Hawking pair production. **Cosmological/astrophysical probes** target deviations in primordial statistics (non-Gaussianities and features), horizon-scale quantum “imprints,” and strong-gravity spectroscopy (e.g., black-hole ringdown) where UV completions could leave small but structured residuals. **Tabletop quantum-information probes** focus on entanglement dynamics—viewing “quantum gravity” not only as new particles, but as new channels, constraints, or resources affecting coherence, scrambling, and recoverability. The common thread is to define signatures that are *robust under effective-field-theory (EFT) reasoning* yet sensitive to the specific way geometry and entanglement are hypothesized to emerge (RG/coarse graining, holographic encoding, discrete microstructure, etc.).\n\n**Analogue gravity** provides the most concrete empirical traction because it can realize horizons, dispersion, and controlled non-equilibrium formation in the lab. The key empirical targets are not merely “a thermal spectrum,” but *a package of correlated observables*: (i) **Hawking-like spectra** together with their dependence on flow profile and temperature; (ii) **dispersion signatures**—how sub-/superluminal dispersion alters mode conversion, introduces cutoff-dependent deviations from exact thermality, and affects late-time correlations; and (iii) **particle–partner correlations** across the analogue horizon, including the entanglement-sensitive structure of density–density correlators emphasized in BEC work. Post-2016 BEC claims of spontaneous Hawking-like radiation have sharpened community priorities: demonstrate **stationarity vs ramp-up dynamics**, quantify **finite-temperature backgrounds**, and separate genuine spontaneous emission from stimulated/parametric effects via metrologically credible systematics. The most decisive “what to measure” items are therefore *time-resolved horizon formation protocols* (to diagnose non-adiabatic production), **correlation tomography** (to test the Hawking pair structure beyond single-mode spectra), and **backreaction-aware modeling** (number-conserving and beyond-fixed-background treatments) to check when the analogue-gravity mapping breaks down. Even when these experiments do not test quantum gravity directly, they rigorously probe the *kinematical engine*—horizon QFT with dispersion and nonstationarity—that many quantum-gravity proposals must reproduce in the appropriate limit.\n\nIn **cosmology and astrophysics**, the goal is to identify “EFT-consistent but distinctive” deviations whose shapes encode microphysical assumptions. For inflationary-era physics, the priority observables are **primordial non-Gaussianities** (especially shape dependence, squeezed-limit behavior, oscillatory features, and parity-violating or non-analytic signals) and any **scale-dependent departures** from the simplest consistency relations that could indicate new degrees of freedom, modified initial states, or nonlocality at horizon crossing. For compact objects, the cleanest spectroscopy channel is **black-hole ringdown**: look for small, structured deviations from Kerr quasi-normal modes (frequency shifts, altered damping times, mode couplings) or late-time **echo-like**/memory-type residuals—while treating environment/systematics (accretion, plasma, population effects) as part of the inference pipeline. A useful synthesis lens is “EFT parameters ↔ microstructure hypotheses”: e.g., modified dispersion/propagation maps to frequency-dependent phase shifts; horizon-scale quantum structure maps to boundary-condition deformations; nonperturbative completions consistent with RG flow constrain which operators can appear without destabilizing semiclassical geometry. The empirical deliverable is not one definitive smoking gun, but a *ranked catalog of waveform/statistics deformations* with priors motivated by candidate frameworks (holography, coarse-grained spin-foam/LQG continuum limits, asymptotic-safety scaling, nonlocal completions), coupled to falsifiable parameter-estimation targets.\n\nThese empirical programs are gated by a short list of **priority theoretical challenges**, ordered by impact and tractability. **(1) Defining observables in quantum gravity** is foundational: what counts as a gauge-invariant, relational, operational quantity (especially in cosmology where there is no asymptotic boundary, and in black holes where “inside” is subtle)? This includes identifying which correlation functions, dressed operators, or relational clocks/rods correspond to what detectors actually measure. **(2) Controlling semiclassical backreaction** is next: both in analogue systems (where the medium responds and number conservation matters) and in real gravity (where Hawking flux, stress-tensor fluctuations, and quantum measurement back-action threaten fixed-background reasoning). **(3) Recovering locality/causality from entanglement-first or discrete microphysics** is a central consistency requirement: frameworks that treat geometry as emergent must show how approximate microcausality and local EFT arise under RG/coarse graining, and quantify the scale and form of allowed nonlocality. **(4) Computational complexity vs geometry** has become a concrete conjectural bridge (especially in holographic settings): to be testable it must yield *sharp inequalities or scaling laws*—e.g., bounds on scrambling, operator growth, or recoverability—that can be compared to quantum-simulation/quantum-device experiments and to gravitational expectations (chaos bounds, information recovery times). **(5) Constructing nonperturbative completions compatible with EFT and RG** is the long pole: whether via holography (where available), background-independent RG/coarse-graining programs (e.g., modern spin-foam renormalization and tensor-network diagnostics of continuum limits), or other completions, the deliverable is a controlled map from microscopic variables to the semiclassical action plus a *prediction set* (which operators appear, which are suppressed, and why). Across all five challenges, the unifying success criterion is the same: produce calculable, relational observables with quantified uncertainties, show that semiclassical gravity is a stable IR attractor under coarse graining, and specify a finite set of deformation parameters that cosmology/astrophysics/analogue/QI experiments can jointly constrain.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Constructive, dynamical map from quantum-information microstates to macroscopic Lorentzian geometry is missing. The corpus identifies entanglement entropy, tensor networks, and modular Hamiltonians as motifs, but lacks an explicit, unitary time-dependent protocol that (a) produces emergent causal structure and metric degrees of freedom from given many-body states, (b) handles finite temperature and mixed states, and (c) respects Lorentz invariance in the continuum limit. Necessary additional information: explicit models showing how microscopic operators map to continuum metric/connection variables (operator dictionaries), examples of time-evolution rules that reproduce semiclassical Einstein equations (with backreaction), constraints on entanglement spectra that yield local lightcones, and numerical/analytic studies of non-equilibrium setups. Open questions to resolve: How does one derive local energy conditions and causal propagation from entanglement dynamics? What are the minimal assumptions about the microdynamics (locality of interactions, conservation laws, entangling rates) needed to recover a classical spacetime with GR-like dynamics?\n- Gap 2: Unified algebraic/gauge structure tying renormalization-group flows, emergent gauge constraints, and gravitational constraints is underdeveloped. The corpus repeatedly invokes symmetry principles, effective field theory and RG as organizing ideas, but lacks a single algebraic framework (e.g., operator algebra, categorical/2-group symmetry, or constraint algebra) that simultaneously: encodes emergent diffeomorphism/gauge invariance, tracks anomalies across scales, and prescribes how coarse-graining transforms constraints into effective gravitational degrees of freedom. Necessary additional information: precise operator-algebraic formulations of constraints for candidate microscopic models, anomaly-matching conditions across emergence, and explicit examples where RG trajectories map to Hamiltonian or constraint algebras of classical gravity. Open questions to resolve: What is the appropriate mathematical object (von Neumann algebra, factorization structure, higher-group) whose flow reproduces the Dirac/ADM constraint algebra? How do anomalies or symmetry breaking at the micro level affect emergent gravitational gauges?\n- Gap 3: Concrete, falsifiable empirical predictions and experimental windows are insufficiently specified. While the corpus lists several suggestive signatures (entanglement scaling, modified dispersion, soft-hair effects), it does not prioritize scales, produce quantitative amplitude estimates, or provide experimental protocols linking proposed unified frameworks to observables in tabletop quantum systems, astrophysical/cosmological data, or gravitational-wave signals. Necessary additional information: scale-setting mechanisms (how microscopic parameters map to Planck, cosmological or laboratory scales), predicted magnitudes and parameter ranges for deviations from GR or QFT (e.g., corrections to dispersion relations, decoherence rates, correlations in CMB or GW spectra), and feasible measurement protocols with error budgets. Open questions to resolve: Which observables offer the highest signal-to-noise for discriminating among candidate frameworks? Can one design table-top experiments (quantum simulators, cold atoms, superconducting qubits) that replicate the essential micro-to-macro emergence and measure predicted signatures?\n\n","nodeId":null,"timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:03:23.986Z","memoryStorageFailed":true},{"type":"synthesis_report","content":"# SYNTHESIS REPORT\n\n**Mission:** Analyze the curated corpus to extract common mathematical patterns and conceptual motifs (e.g., symmetry principles, gauge structures, effective field theory, renormalization, entanglement structures, emergent degrees of freedom).

Closely linked motifs include **effective field theory logic** (separating universal infrared behavior from UV details), **renormalization/coarse-graining** as the core bridge between micro- and macro-descriptions, and **quantum-information structure** (entanglement patterns, tensor-network-like factorizations, and error-correcting properties) as the organizing principle behind emergent geometry. In this view, classical spacetime and gravity arise as **collective, semiclassical variables**—e.g., geometric operators and hydrodynamic-like fields—whose consistency is enforced by symmetry constraints and whose dynamics is stabilized by RG fixed points or universality classes.\n\nThe report’s key synthesis insight is that the most credible reconciliation strategy between classical and quantum descriptions is to make **coarse-graining/RG flow explicit**, mapping microscopic quantum degrees of freedom to macroscopic geometric observables while preserving gauge constraints and locality in an emergent sense. This yields 2–3 viable candidate framework sketches: (i) **entanglement-to-geometry constructions** (geometry as an information-theoretic order parameter), (ii) **RG-driven emergent gravity** (Einstein-like dynamics as an IR fixed-point effective theory), and (iii) **constraint-first quantization/coarse-graining hybrids** (ensuring the correct symmetry/constraint algebra survives discretization and continuum limits). Empirically, the corpus converges on targeting **operational signatures**—small deviations from classical propagation, universality-violating corrections, horizon/entropy relations, and cosmological imprints—while prioritizing a short list of gating theoretical challenges: defining robust observables in generally covariant settings, proving controlled continuum limits under coarse-graining, and demonstrating that emergent locality/causality and semiclassical Einstein dynamics arise without fine-tuning.\n\n---\n\n## 1) CROSS-CORPUS MOTIFS: SHARED MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES AND CONCEPTUAL INVARIANTS\n\n## 1) Cross-Corpus Motifs: Shared Mathematical Structures and Conceptual Invariants\n\nAcross the corpus, the strongest conceptual invariants are symmetry principles—implemented as redundancies, constraints, and consistency conditions rather than optional aesthetic features. In canonical loop quantum gravity (LQG), the shift to Ashtekar connection variables recasts gravity as a constrained gauge system: the basic fields are an SU(2) connection \\(A^i_a\\) and a densitized triad \\(E^a_i\\), with dynamics enforced by first-class constraints. Canonically one tracks the Gauss constraint \\(G_i \\approx 0\\) (internal SU(2) gauge redundancy), the spatial diffeomorphism constraint \\(V_a \\approx 0\\), and the Hamiltonian constraint \\(H \\approx 0\\), encoding refoliation invariance. The “seminal sequence” (Ashtekar; Rovelli–Smolin; Ashtekar–Isham; Ashtekar–Lewandowski) established a rigorous holonomy/loop-algebra representation: holonomies \\(h_e[A]=\\mathcal{P}\\exp\\int_e A\\) and fluxes \\(E(S,f)=\\int_S f_i E^a_i n_a\\) become the nonperturbative kinematical variables, with spin networks furnishing a diffeomorphism-covariant basis and yielding discrete spectra for geometric operators (area/volume). In string/holographic approaches, the same motif appears as “no global symmetries” and anomaly/consistency constraints on the boundary theory, with bulk diffeomorphism invariance mirrored by boundary gauge redundancies and Ward identities. In swampland framing, would-be low-energy EFTs are filtered by consistency conditions (e.g., no global symmetries, distance/weak gravity constraints), functioning as symmetry-informed selection rules on admissible effective descriptions. The shared invariant is that “physical states” are equivalence classes under gauge/diffeomorphism actions, and dynamics is organized around constraint algebras or their dual Ward identities—different languages enforcing the same requirement: redundancy must not leak into observables.\n\nA second cross-cutting motif is entanglement as a geometric and thermodynamic organizing principle, even when the microscopic degrees of freedom differ. In holography, entanglement entropy is tied directly to bulk geometry via the Ryu–Takayanagi/HRT relation,\n\\[\nS(A)=\\frac{\\mathrm{Area}(\\gamma_A)}{4G_N}+S_{\\text{bulk}}(\\Sigma_A),\n\\]\nwith the modular Hamiltonian \\(K_A=-\\log\\rho_A\\) and entanglement wedge reconstruction encoding a precise “information-theoretic” notion of bulk locality. The corpus highlights an actionable route: studying relevant deformations away from strict CFT fixed points to track how changes in boundary entanglement data map to bulk metric perturbations—effectively using \\(\\delta S\\) and modular response to diagnose emergent geometry. In background-independent settings (LQG/spin foams, causal sets), entanglement enters more implicitly but with the same structural role: geometric observables (e.g., area operators in LQG) behave like “surface data” that naturally couple to boundary/region factorization, while causal-set progress explicitly targets QFT observables on discrete substrates, including entanglement entropy and in-in correlators, to connect microstructure to continuum phenomenology. The common invariant is an “area-law/edge-mode” pattern: whenever gauge constraints prevent naive tensor factorization, physically meaningful entanglement is organized by boundary degrees of freedom (or their discrete analogues), and entropy-like quantities become probes of emergent geometric or causal structure.\n\nRenormalization and coarse-graining form the third unifying spine, repeatedly invoked (including in cross-program editorials) as the technical bridge between microscopic discreteness and semiclassical continuity. In holography, RG flow is geometrized (radial direction as scale), with fixed points corresponding to AdS asymptotics and relevant deformations driving flows away from conformality. In spin-foam LQG (2018–2025), the emphasis shifts from kinematics to continuum recovery via background-independent renormalization: one coarse-grains amplitudes on foams/2-complexes and looks for fixed points and universality classes where effective diffeomorphism symmetry is restored, often using tensor-network-inspired methods to control the coarse-graining map. In causal sets, analogous “manifold emergence” questions are posed as dynamical suppression of non-manifold-like orders, i.e., a coarse-graining/selection mechanism on the space of discrete structures. The shared formal template is Wilsonian: define an effective action or effective amplitude \\(S_\\Lambda\\) (or an effective transfer map) at scale \\(\\Lambda\\), evolve it under an RG transformation \\( \\Lambda \\partial_\\Lambda g_i = \\beta_i(\\{g\\})\\), and diagnose continuum physics by fixed points, relevant directions, and universal long-distance observables. Even when the “couplings” are not standard local operators (e.g., spin-foam face/edge weights, causal-set nonlocal kernels), the motif remains: consistent macroscopic gravity requires a controlled flow toward a universality class reproducing approximate locality, Lorentz/diffeomorphism symmetry, and the correct low-energy degrees of freedom.\n\nThese motifs converge into a shared effective-field-theory (EFT) logic of emergence: whatever the UV completion, low-energy predictions are organized by operator expansions, cutoff dependence, and decoupling—plus a hydrodynamic limit where collective variables dominate. In string/swampland discourse, the EFT is constrained by UV consistency (the “landscape vs swampland” filter), while in LQG/spin foams the EFT problem appears as deriving an effective continuum action and graviton-like excitations from discrete quantum geometry (including earlier work connecting to Fock-space/graviton regimes). In analogue-gravity experiments, the same emergence logic is operationalized: Hawking-like signals are interrogated for robustness under dispersion, finite temperature, and nonstationarity—i.e., which features are universal IR predictions versus UV-sensitive artifacts of the medium. The cross-corpus invariant is a two-stage pipeline: (i) identify the correct collective observables (geometry from holonomies/fluxes; bulk distances from boundary entanglement; causal relations from order structure; phonon metrics from condensate flow), and (ii) show that their long-wavelength dynamics is governed by a small set of relevant parameters, largely independent of microscopic details.\n\n### Motif-to-Formalism Map (key variables and canonical equations)\n\n| Motif | Representative formalisms | Key variables | Canonical equations/relations (schematic) | What stays invariant across approaches |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Gauge redundancy & constraints | Canonical GR/LQG; boundary gauge theories in holography; swampland consistency | LQG: \\(A^i_a, E^a_i\\); states as equivalence classes; boundary currents/charges | Constraints: \\(G_i\\approx0,\\; V_a\\approx0,\\; H\\approx0\\).

The corpus thus points to a practical synthesis strategy: align each approach’s native variables (holonomies/fluxes; boundary density matrices/modular operators; causal order relations; medium excitations) with the same triad of diagnostics—constraint consistency, entanglement structure, and RG fixed-point behavior—so that “emergent gravity” becomes a comparably testable statement across otherwise incommensurate formalisms.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 2) FROM MICROSCOPIC QUANTUM INFORMATION TO MACROSCOPIC GEOMETRY: MECHANISMS OF EMERGENCE\n\n### 2) From Microscopic Quantum Information to Macroscopic Geometry: Mechanisms of Emergence\n\nA convergent theme across modern quantum-gravity programs is that *classical spacetime is not fundamental*, but an effective description of underlying quantum degrees of freedom organized by entanglement and coarse graining. The sharpest nonperturbative arena for this idea is holography (AdS/CFT): a quantum many-body theory without gravity (the “boundary” QFT) can encode a higher-dimensional gravitational bulk in which distances and causal structure are readable from quantum-information data. In this picture, geometric quantities become functionals of the boundary state—most prominently via the Ryu–Takayanagi/HRT relation, where the entanglement entropy \\(S(A)\\) of a boundary region \\(A\\) is computed by an extremal bulk surface \\(\\gamma_A\\), \\(S(A)=\\mathrm{Area}(\\gamma_A)/(4G_N)+S_{\\text{bulk}}(\\Sigma_A)\\). This provides a direct entanglement-to-geometry dictionary: changing the entanglement pattern changes the bulk area functional and hence the effective metric. A concrete, actionable route (and one that remains robust beyond strictly conformal settings) is to study *relevant deformations* of holographic CFTs: by computing entanglement entropies and RT/HRT surface shifts in nonconformal “AdS/CFT-like” toy models, one can explicitly map how particular entanglement perturbations correspond to specific bulk metric perturbations, thereby turning the slogan “entanglement builds geometry” into a calculable kernel from boundary data to bulk fields.\n\nMechanistically, the emergence pipeline can be organized into intermediate scales where approximations enter. **(i) Microscopic layer (UV):** a lattice/field-theoretic quantum system with Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal H\\), local operator algebra, and a state \\(\\rho\\) (pure or mixed). **(ii) Information-theoretic coarse graining:** choose a family of subregions \\(A\\) and compute entanglement/relative-entropy data \\(\\{S(A),\\, S(\\rho_A\\|\\sigma_A)\\}\\) with respect to a reference state \\(\\sigma\\) (often the vacuum). This step already assumes an operational split into subsystems and a notion of “simple” observables. **(iii) Renormalization/geometry layer:** apply an entanglement RG (e.g., MERA-like constructions) or a quantum error-correction viewpoint to build an emergent bulk where *scale* corresponds to RG depth; tensor networks serve as discrete geometries in which graph connectivity and bond dimensions encode entanglement structure. Here, geometry is approximate: the network defines a coarse metric and causal structure only for a restricted code subspace and a limited class of low-complexity operators. **(iv) Semiclassical continuum limit:** when the state has large effective central charge/large-\\(N\\) structure, sparse low-dimension spectrum, and a large gap to stringy/UV modes, the discrete bulk can be approximated by a smooth manifold with a local effective action. This is the stage at which a classical metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) becomes a good variable, and corrections organize via \\(1/N\\), higher-derivative terms, and quantum extremal surface contributions \\(S_{\\text{bulk}}\\). **(v) Macroscopic gravity/thermodynamics:** at long distances and after additional coarse graining (often tracing over microscopic bulk matter and high-frequency metric modes), gravitational dynamics can be rewritten in thermodynamic language, where entropy functionals and coarse-grained energy flux control effective equations of motion; this is the regime where “entropic gravity” intuitions apply, but only as an emergent rewriting of underlying microscopic unitary dynamics rather than a fundamental modification.\n\nWithin this pipeline, there is now a fairly crisp set of assumptions under which *semiclassical Einstein equations* can be derived (or strongly constrained) from quantum-information identities. A standard route uses the **entanglement first law**—for small perturbations around a reference state, \\(\\delta S_A=\\delta\\langle K_A\\rangle\\), where \\(K_A\\) is the modular Hamiltonian of \\(\\sigma_A\\)—together with **relative entropy positivity/monotonicity**, \\(S(\\rho_A\\|\\sigma_A)\\ge 0\\) and its behavior under inclusion. For ball-shaped regions in the vacuum of a relativistic QFT, \\(K_A\\) is local, so \\(\\delta\\langle K_A\\rangle\\) becomes an integral of the stress tensor; via the RT relation, \\(\\delta S_A\\) becomes a linearized area variation determined by \\(\\delta g_{\\mu\\nu}\\). Matching these two sides across all such regions enforces the **linearized Einstein equation** with appropriate boundary conditions, while stronger constraints from relative entropy for nested regions and modular flow support the extension toward nonlinear dynamics in a code subspace where bulk locality holds. Conceptually, the key approximation is *state restriction*: one assumes a semiclassical sector in which modular flow is sufficiently “coarse-grained local” (or approximated by local boosts near entangling surfaces), bulk fields satisfy effective equations, and gravitational constraints behave like consistency conditions ensuring that entanglement wedges glue into a single geometry. Outside this sector—e.g., highly excited states with strong backreaction, large quantum extremal surface fluctuations, or nonlocal modular Hamiltonians—the mapping becomes state-dependent and the Einstein description can fail or require nonlocal corrections.\n\nTensor networks and thermodynamic gravity ideas provide complementary intuition for *why* this works and where it breaks. Tensor networks (MERA, random tensor networks, and holographic quantum error-correcting codes) make the emergence visually and computationally explicit: locality in the bulk corresponds to approximately correctable operator reconstruction, while minimal cuts through the network reproduce RT-like area laws and identify “bulk distance” with entanglement cost. In parallel, entropic/thermodynamic approaches reinterpret gravitational dynamics as coarse-grained constraints on information flow—e.g., relating energy flux through local Rindler horizons to entropy variations—highlighting that Einstein’s equation can be viewed as an equation of state for a particular universality class of quantum matter coupled to emergent geometry. The synthesis point is that these are not competing mechanisms but different projections of the same hierarchy: microscopic entanglement patterns (UV) \\(\\rightarrow\\) RG/tensor-network coarse graining (mesoscopic geometry) \\(\\rightarrow\\) semiclassical code subspace with RT/HRT (continuum geometry) \\(\\rightarrow\\) entanglement first law + relative entropy constraints (Einstein dynamics) \\(\\rightarrow\\) further coarse graining (thermodynamic/entropic rewriting). A near-term program that operationalizes this synthesis is to compute entanglement diagnostics and RT/HRT responses in deformed holographic models (nonconformal flows), extract explicit entanglement-to-metric response functions, and then test how those kernels are reproduced (or modified) by tensor-network coarse graining—pinpointing, step by step, where large-\\(N\\), locality of modular flow, and semiclassicality enter as the decisive approximations.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 3) CANDIDATE UNIFIED FRAMEWORK SKETCHES (2–3): FORMAL OUTLINES, MAPPINGS, AND INTERNAL CONSISTENCY CHECKS\n\n### 3) Candidate Unified Framework Sketches (2–3): Formal Outlines, Mappings, and Internal Consistency Checks\n\nAcross otherwise divergent quantum-gravity programs, the most robust “reconciliation lever” is **explicit coarse-graining/RG flow**: start from microscopic degrees of freedom (DoF) that need not look geometric, and demand that under controlled coarse-graining one recovers (i) an effective geometric description with (approximate) diffeomorphism symmetry and (ii) **QFT in curved spacetime** as the matter sector on that emergent background. This section therefore presents three “framework cards” that make the classical↔quantum mapping explicit via: (A) a continuum effective action with an RG scale (background independence replaced by split-symmetry control), (B) a holographic/entanglement-to-geometry map (gravity as entanglement dynamics), and (C) a discrete causal-order substrate with continuum QFT observables as targets (causal-set style), each with internal consistency checks (unitarity, causality/locality, anomaly control) and clear failure modes. The translation layer’s common anchor is used throughout: **RG/coarse-graining is the cross-community technical bridge from microstructure to semiclassical limits**.\n\n**Framework Card A — “RG-complete Effective Geometry” (EFT ↔ Asymptotic-safety-style flow):**  \n**DoF:** a (coarse-grained) metric field \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and matter fields \\(\\phi\\), treated via a scale-dependent effective action \\(\\Gamma_k[g,\\phi;\\bar g]\\) (with background \\(\\bar g\\) used only as an intermediate device). **Dynamical principle:** RG-improved stationary action \\(\\delta \\Gamma_k/\\delta g=0\\), \\(\\delta \\Gamma_k/\\delta\\phi=0\\), with scale evolution governed by a functional RG equation of Wetterich type,\n\\[\n\\partial_k \\Gamma_k \\;=\\; \\tfrac12 \\mathrm{Tr}\\Big[(\\Gamma_k^{(2)}+R_k)^{-1}\\,\\partial_k R_k\\Big],\n\\]\nwhere \\(R_k\\) is an IR regulator and \\(\\Gamma_k^{(2)}\\) the Hessian. **Classical↔quantum mapping:** classical GR corresponds to the IR regime where \\(\\Gamma_{k\\to 0}\\) is well-approximated by a local derivative expansion (e.g. Einstein–Hilbert + higher-curvature corrections), while “quantum spacetime” is encoded in the full trajectory \\(\\{\\Gamma_k\\}_{k}\\) and its fixed points/critical surface. **Limit to GR + QFT in curved spacetime:** (i) take \\(k\\to 0\\) to obtain an effective action with renormalized couplings; (ii) expand \\(\\Gamma_{0}[g,\\phi]\\) around a semiclassical solution \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}^{\\rm sc}\\) to recover QFT on \\((M,g^{\\rm sc})\\) with higher-dimension operators suppressed by the RG scale/Planckian thresholds. **Consistency requirements:** (1) **unitarity**: absence of ghosts/tachyons in the effective spectrum (especially if higher-curvature terms become important); (2) **causality/locality**: controlled nonlocalities generated by RG flow must remain compatible with microcausality in the QFT-in-curved-spacetime limit; (3) **(effective) background independence**: regulator/background artifacts must be tamed via split-symmetry/modified Ward identities; (4) **anomaly control**: diffeomorphism/Weyl anomalies must match between matter+gravity sectors. **RG/coarse-graining implementation:** literal integration of modes above/below \\(k\\), yielding scale-dependent couplings \\(G(k),\\Lambda(k),\\dots\\). **Failure modes:** (a) no suitable fixed point/trajectory giving a predictive IR; (b) regulator/background dependence does not wash out; (c) RG-generated higher-derivative terms yield unitarity violations; (d) semiclassical limit fails to reproduce stable QFT-in-curved-spacetime behavior (e.g., uncontrolled nonlocal dissipation).\n\n**Framework Card B — “Entanglement/Operator Data → Bulk Geometry” (Holography/induced gravity sketch):**  \n**DoF:** boundary quantum DoF (density matrix \\(\\rho\\), operator algebra \\(\\mathcal A\\), and entanglement structure), with bulk fields \\((g_{\\mu\\nu},\\Phi)\\) emergent. **Dynamical principle:** a dictionary equating generating functionals, schematically \\(Z_{\\text{bulk}}[g,\\Phi]\\approx Z_{\\text{QFT}}[J]\\), with geometry determined by constraints on entanglement and correlation functions. A central structural equation is the Ryu–Takayanagi/quantum extremal surface relation (as a mapping rule rather than a derived identity in this sketch),\n\\[\nS(A)\\;=\\;\\frac{\\mathrm{Area}(\\gamma_A)}{4G_N}\\;+\\;S_{\\text{bulk}}(\\Sigma_A)\\;+\\cdots,\n\\]\nlinking boundary entanglement entropy \\(S(A)\\) to bulk geometric data. **Classical↔quantum mapping:** classical spacetime corresponds to large-\\(N\\)/strong-coupling (or otherwise “geometric”) regimes where entanglement organizes into a smooth metric; quantum gravity corresponds to \\(1/N\\) and bulk-entanglement corrections in \\(S_{\\text{bulk}}\\) and higher-point operator data. **Limit to GR + QFT in curved spacetime:** (i) in the regime where a semiclassical bulk exists, the bulk effective dynamics reduce to Einstein equations with quantum corrections, while (ii) bulk matter correlators reproduce QFT in curved spacetime on that emergent background; operationally, one checks that bulk low-energy correlators satisfy local QFT axioms to the needed approximation. **Consistency requirements:** (1) **unitarity**: boundary theory unitarity must map to bulk information conservation (including black-hole evaporation channels in settings where they are modelable); (2) **causality/locality**: boundary operator commutators and entanglement wedge reconstruction must yield an approximately local bulk causal structure in the semiclassical regime; (3) **anomaly matching**: boundary anomalies (e.g. stress-tensor Ward identities) must match bulk constraint equations; (4) **effective background independence**: geometry is not fixed but reconstructed from state-dependent data (replacing background independence with “state-dependent emergence”). **RG/coarse-graining implementation:** boundary RG flow (including relevant deformations) corresponds to radial/scale evolution of bulk geometry; coarse-graining entanglement (e.g. integrating out UV modes) changes the effective bulk metric and couplings. **Failure modes:** (a) emergence is limited to special classes of dual pairs, leaving generic spacetimes uncovered; (b) locality breaks down outside code-subspace regimes; (c) reconstruction becomes state-dependent in a way that obstructs a global bulk description; (d) nontrivial cosmological (e.g. dS-like) regimes are not captured without additional structure.\n\n**Framework Card C — “Discrete Causal Order → Continuum Fields” (Causal-set–style QFT observables as targets):**  \n**DoF:** a locally finite partially ordered set \\((C,\\prec)\\) encoding causal relations, possibly with additional labels/fields \\(\\varphi: C\\to \\mathbb R\\) for matter. **Dynamical principle:** a sum-over-histories (or stochastic growth) over causal orders weighted by an action \\(S[C]\\) and matter action \\(S_{\\text{m}}[\\varphi,C]\\),\n\\[\n\\mathcal Z \\;=\\;\\sum_{C}\\int \\mathcal D\\varphi\\;\\exp\\!\\big(iS[C]+iS_{\\text m}[\\varphi,C]\\big),\n\\]\nwith continuum physics recovered from typical coarse-grained configurations. **Classical↔quantum mapping:** classical spacetime corresponds to causal sets approximating Lorentzian manifolds under appropriate embedding/sprinkling conditions; quantum behavior is encoded in fluctuations over orders and in matter-field path integrals defined directly on the discrete causal structure. **Limit to GR + QFT in curved spacetime:** (i) identify a regime where the order approximates a smooth \\((M,g)\\) (recovering an effective d’Alembertian/propagator and approximate locality); (ii) compute **QFT observables explicitly emphasized in the corpus**—entanglement entropy and in-in correlators/scattering—directly on the causal set and show they converge to their curved-spacetime counterparts under refinement/coarse-graining. **Consistency requirements:** (1) **unitarity**: the discrete in-in (Schwinger–Keldysh) construction must yield consistent probability conservation; (2) **causality**: fundamental order enforces causal precedence, but one must show emergent microcausality and controlled lightcone fluctuations; (3) **(effective) diffeomorphism invariance**: replaced by label-independence/order-invariance of the measure and observables; (4) **anomaly control**: discrete definitions of stress-energy and its conservation must reproduce continuum Ward identities in the limit. **RG/coarse-graining implementation:** coarse-graining is defined as thinning/decimation or blockings of the poset (integrating out elements while preserving large-scale order properties), tracking flows of effective couplings in \\(S[C]\\) and of matter correlators. **Failure modes:** (a) non-manifoldlike phases dominate the sum, preventing GR recovery; (b) Lorentz symmetry/locality fail to emerge at acceptable scales; (c) entanglement/correlator targets do not converge to QFT-in-curved-spacetime values; (d) defining a predictive, computable measure over \\(C\\) remains intractable.\n\nTaken together, these sketches emphasize a shared internal logic: (i) specify micro/meso DoF; (ii) provide a principled dynamics (action/Hamiltonian/constraint or reconstruction rule); (iii) implement coarse-graining/RG as the bridge to emergent geometry; and (iv) demand hard consistency checks (unitarity, causality, anomaly matching, and an explicit semiclassical limit yielding GR + QFT in curved spacetime). The frameworks differ mainly in what is taken as fundamental—fields on a continuum with RG completion (A), entanglement/operator data with geometric dual (B), or discrete causal order with continuum observables as convergence targets (C)—and therefore in where they are most likely to fail (respectively: regulator/background artifacts and ghosts; limited duality class and locality breakdown; dominance of non-manifoldlike phases and poor continuum convergence).\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 4) EMPIRICAL SIGNATURES AND PRIORITY CHALLENGES: WHAT TO MEASURE, WHAT TO PROVE\n\n## 4) Empirical Signatures and Priority Challenges: What to Measure, What to Prove\n\nA productive synthesis strategy is to translate “emergence/quantization of geometry” frameworks into *operationally defined observables* and then rank theoretical obstacles by (i) how directly they gate contact with data and (ii) tractability. Empirically, the near-term landscape splits into three complementary windows. **Analogue-gravity platforms** (BECs, water waves, optics, and related media) already deliver controlled tests of *QFT on effective curved backgrounds*: horizon-induced mode conversion, approximate thermality, and correlation structures that mimic Hawking pair production. **Cosmological/astrophysical probes** target deviations in primordial statistics (non-Gaussianities and features), horizon-scale quantum “imprints,” and strong-gravity spectroscopy (e.g., black-hole ringdown) where UV completions could leave small but structured residuals. **Tabletop quantum-information probes** focus on entanglement dynamics—viewing “quantum gravity” not only as new particles, but as new channels, constraints, or resources affecting coherence, scrambling, and recoverability. The common thread is to define signatures that are *robust under effective-field-theory (EFT) reasoning* yet sensitive to the specific way geometry and entanglement are hypothesized to emerge (RG/coarse graining, holographic encoding, discrete microstructure, etc.).\n\n**Analogue gravity** provides the most concrete empirical traction because it can realize horizons, dispersion, and controlled non-equilibrium formation in the lab. The key empirical targets are not merely “a thermal spectrum,” but *a package of correlated observables*: (i) **Hawking-like spectra** together with their dependence on flow profile and temperature; (ii) **dispersion signatures**—how sub-/superluminal dispersion alters mode conversion, introduces cutoff-dependent deviations from exact thermality, and affects late-time correlations; and (iii) **particle–partner correlations** across the analogue horizon, including the entanglement-sensitive structure of density–density correlators emphasized in BEC work. Post-2016 BEC claims of spontaneous Hawking-like radiation have sharpened community priorities: demonstrate **stationarity vs ramp-up dynamics**, quantify **finite-temperature backgrounds**, and separate genuine spontaneous emission from stimulated/parametric effects via metrologically credible systematics. The most decisive “what to measure” items are therefore *time-resolved horizon formation protocols* (to diagnose non-adiabatic production), **correlation tomography** (to test the Hawking pair structure beyond single-mode spectra), and **backreaction-aware modeling** (number-conserving and beyond-fixed-background treatments) to check when the analogue-gravity mapping breaks down. Even when these experiments do not test quantum gravity directly, they rigorously probe the *kinematical engine*—horizon QFT with dispersion and nonstationarity—that many quantum-gravity proposals must reproduce in the appropriate limit.\n\nIn **cosmology and astrophysics**, the goal is to identify “EFT-consistent but distinctive” deviations whose shapes encode microphysical assumptions. For inflationary-era physics, the priority observables are **primordial non-Gaussianities** (especially shape dependence, squeezed-limit behavior, oscillatory features, and parity-violating or non-analytic signals) and any **scale-dependent departures** from the simplest consistency relations that could indicate new degrees of freedom, modified initial states, or nonlocality at horizon crossing. For compact objects, the cleanest spectroscopy channel is **black-hole ringdown**: look for small, structured deviations from Kerr quasi-normal modes (frequency shifts, altered damping times, mode couplings) or late-time **echo-like**/memory-type residuals—while treating environment/systematics (accretion, plasma, population effects) as part of the inference pipeline. A useful synthesis lens is “EFT parameters ↔ microstructure hypotheses”: e.g., modified dispersion/propagation maps to frequency-dependent phase shifts; horizon-scale quantum structure maps to boundary-condition deformations; nonperturbative completions consistent with RG flow constrain which operators can appear without destabilizing semiclassical geometry. The empirical deliverable is not one definitive smoking gun, but a *ranked catalog of waveform/statistics deformations* with priors motivated by candidate frameworks (holography, coarse-grained spin-foam/LQG continuum limits, asymptotic-safety scaling, nonlocal completions), coupled to falsifiable parameter-estimation targets.\n\nThese empirical programs are gated by a short list of **priority theoretical challenges**, ordered by impact and tractability. **(1) Defining observables in quantum gravity** is foundational: what counts as a gauge-invariant, relational, operational quantity (especially in cosmology where there is no asymptotic boundary, and in black holes where “inside” is subtle)? This includes identifying which correlation functions, dressed operators, or relational clocks/rods correspond to what detectors actually measure. **(2) Controlling semiclassical backreaction** is next: both in analogue systems (where the medium responds and number conservation matters) and in real gravity (where Hawking flux, stress-tensor fluctuations, and quantum measurement back-action threaten fixed-background reasoning). **(3) Recovering locality/causality from entanglement-first or discrete microphysics** is a central consistency requirement: frameworks that treat geometry as emergent must show how approximate microcausality and local EFT arise under RG/coarse graining, and quantify the scale and form of allowed nonlocality. **(4) Computational complexity vs geometry** has become a concrete conjectural bridge (especially in holographic settings): to be testable it must yield *sharp inequalities or scaling laws*—e.g., bounds on scrambling, operator growth, or recoverability—that can be compared to quantum-simulation/quantum-device experiments and to gravitational expectations (chaos bounds, information recovery times). **(5) Constructing nonperturbative completions compatible with EFT and RG** is the long pole: whether via holography (where available), background-independent RG/coarse-graining programs (e.g., modern spin-foam renormalization and tensor-network diagnostics of continuum limits), or other completions, the deliverable is a controlled map from microscopic variables to the semiclassical action plus a *prediction set* (which operators appear, which are suppressed, and why). Across all five challenges, the unifying success criterion is the same: produce calculable, relational observables with quantified uncertainties, show that semiclassical gravity is a stable IR attractor under coarse graining, and specify a finite set of deformation parameters that cosmology/astrophysics/analogue/QI experiments can jointly constrain.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Constructive, dynamical map from quantum-information microstates to macroscopic Lorentzian geometry is missing.

This triangle explains why disparate approaches converge on similar motifs: classical spacetime is treated as a robust *fixed point/sector* stabilized by symmetry and RG, while quantum descriptions emphasize relational observables and redundancy.\n\nFrom these motifs, the synthesis supports 2–3 plausible reconciliation sketches: **(1) Entanglement-to-geometry + RG** frameworks (e.g., tensor-network/holographic-style reconstructions) where geometry is an emergent parameterization of entanglement data and semiclassical gravity corresponds to a constrained extremum principle; **(2) Constraint/Algebra-first quantum gravity**, where quantization is applied to the constraint algebra and classical spacetime arises in semiclassical representations of the observable algebra; and **(3) Effective-field-theory-with-emergent-symmetry** views, where gravity is the universal long-distance theory consistent with locality, unitarity, and symmetry, with classicality arising from decoherence and RG stability. The report highlights empirical and simulation priorities common to all: search for **universal, model-agnostic signatures** (modified dispersion/propagation, consistency relations in entanglement spectra, quantum-gravity corrections to effective couplings), develop **operational reconstruction tests** (bulk-from-boundary/information-complete tomography), and resolve key theoretical bottlenecks—maintaining gauge-invariant locality, controlling RG flows of operator algebras, and deriving classical outcomes (decoherence and measurement) without ad hoc collapse.\n\n---\n\n## I. CROSS-CORPUS MOTIFS: SHARED MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES AND CONCEPTUAL INVARIANTS\n\n## I. Cross-Corpus Motifs: Shared Mathematical Structures and Conceptual Invariants\n\nAcross the corpus, the most stable “conceptual invariants” are not specific microscopic models but *constraint-first* structures: redundancies (diffeomorphisms, gauge symmetry, reparameterizations), their associated Ward/Slavnov–Taylor identities, and the operational insistence that physical statements be phrased in terms of gauge-invariant observables (or relational/operational ones when local observables are obstructed). This theme appears both in mathematically controlled QFT foundations (AQFT/pAQFT and related locality/covariance principles) and in quantum-gravity programs whose canonical formulations are literally built from constraints (Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints; projector-to-constraints logic in covariant/spinfoam-like settings). The recurring role of these structures is to (i) delimit the *space of admissible effective theories* and (ii) provide “non-negotiable” consistency conditions that survive changes of variables, regulators, or discretizations—precisely the kind of cross-community common ground highlighted by the corpus’s emphasis on reducing interpretive drift via formal constraints and calculational control.\n\nA second motif is the repeated identification of *entanglement/information as a geometric organizing principle*, most sharply instantiated in holography but echoed more broadly whenever entropy and correlation structures serve as “order parameters” for emergent spacetime behavior. In this framing, area-law scaling, modular Hamiltonians, and relative entropy become geometric diagnostics: they govern what can be reconstructed, what is protected against perturbations, and how semiclassical locality is encoded in nonlocal microscopic degrees of freedom. Even when a full AdS/CFT dictionary is not assumed, the corpus repeatedly returns to the same formal triangle—(i) geometric entropy functionals, (ii) entanglement wedges / reconstruction maps, and (iii) error-correction-like protection of bulk information—because it provides a template for how classical geometry can arise from quantum correlations while remaining compatible with gauge redundancy (subregion duality and edge/boundary degrees of freedom being a canonical example of this interplay).\n\nA third cross-cutting invariant is *EFT logic plus universality*: whatever the microscopic completion, viable semiclassical physics is expected to emerge through controlled coarse-graining, decoupling, and symmetry-constrained operator expansions. This is the point where the corpus’s “RG/coarse-graining as unifier” becomes technically meaningful: renormalization is treated less as a computational trick and more as the *scale-bridging mechanism* that explains why many inequivalent micro-theories can share the same infrared behavior (effective diffeomorphism invariance, approximate locality, and familiar field content). The same logic also underwrites the corpus’s benchmark-oriented attitude: rather than adjudicating interpretations, one targets observables that are stable under coarse-graining (correlators, entanglement measures, noise/decoherence spectra, robustness/systematics in analogue settings), and then asks whether candidate microscopic models reproduce those invariants without fine-tuning.\n\nFinally, the corpus repeatedly highlights *emergent degrees of freedom*—collective modes, boundary/edge variables, and relational observables—as the practical bridge between “microscopic” descriptions (discrete structures, constrained phase spaces, or dual quantum systems) and “macroscopic” semiclassical fields. This is where information-theoretic structures and constraint principles meet: gauge redundancy forces a careful accounting of what counts as a subsystem; that accounting, in turn, naturally introduces boundary terms and modular data (modular Hamiltonians, relative entropy) that behave like new effective variables. Across approaches, the conceptual role is consistent: emergent variables are not optional embellishments but the bookkeeping devices that make locality, thermality, and geometry simultaneously compatible with (i) gauge constraints and (ii) coarse-grained universality.\n\n---\n\n### Categorized Motif Map (structures → representative equations → conceptual role)\n\n| Motif (shared structure) | Representative equations (schematic) | Conceptual role / cross-links |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Gauge/diffeomorphism redundancy; constraint-first dynamics** | Constraints: \\(\\mathcal{H}\\approx 0,\\ \\mathcal{H}_i\\approx 0\\).

FORMAL SYNTHESIS: COMMON MATHEMATICAL BACKBONE (GEOMETRY–INFORMATION–RG TRIANGLE)\n\n## II. Formal Synthesis: Common Mathematical Backbone (Geometry–Information–RG Triangle)\n\nA common mathematical scaffold across otherwise distinct quantum-gravity programs can be organized as a **triangle linking (i) information/entanglement, (ii) coarse-graining/RG, and (iii) emergent geometry with gravitational constraints**. On the **information** corner, the central objects are reduced states \\(\\rho_A\\), entanglement entropies \\(S_A=-\\mathrm{Tr}\\,\\rho_A\\log\\rho_A\\), and the **modular Hamiltonian** \\(K_A:=-\\log \\rho_A\\), whose modular flow \\(U_A(s)=e^{-isK_A}\\) packages “intrinsic” dynamics seen by subregions. A key control quantity is **relative entropy**\n\\[\nS(\\rho_A\\Vert\\sigma_A)=\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_A\\log\\rho_A-\\rho_A\\log\\sigma_A)=\\Delta\\langle K_A^{(\\sigma)}\\rangle-\\Delta S_A,\n\\]\nwhich is nonnegative and monotone under coarse-graining; this monotonicity is the information-theoretic backbone behind “irreversibility” statements that also appear as RG monotones in effective descriptions. In semiclassical regimes (where a state is close to a reference, e.g. vacuum), the **entanglement first law** \\(\\delta S_A=\\delta\\langle K_A\\rangle\\) makes the bridge to dynamics: small variations of entropy are equivalent to variations of a (generally nonlocal) generator, suggesting that “equations of motion” can be reframed as consistency conditions on modular data.\n\nThe **RG/coarse-graining** corner supplies the operational meaning of “scale” and “emergence,” aligning with the cross-program framing (special-issue/editorial mapping) that treats RG/coarse-graining as a unifying technical thread. Abstractly, coarse-graining is a map \\(\\mathcal{E}_\\mu\\) (often taken CPTP in quantum-information language) producing an effective state \\(\\rho(\\mu)=\\mathcal{E}_\\mu[\\rho]\\) at RG scale \\(\\mu\\). The same move can be expressed in QFT terms as integrating out modes above \\(\\mu\\), yielding an effective action \\(S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mu)\\) and running couplings \\(g_i(\\mu)\\). The information-theoretic and RG languages become interchangeable once one fixes the “kept observables” \\(\\mathcal{O}_{\\le\\mu}\\): relative entropy \\(S(\\rho(\\mu)\\Vert\\sigma(\\mu))\\) quantifies distinguishability *at scale \\(\\mu\\)* and is guaranteed to decrease as one discards UV detail. In gravity-sensitive settings (e.g., decoherence/noise benchmarks, QFT observables on discrete structures), this becomes practical: “what survives coarse-graining” is precisely what remains diagnosable in spectra, correlators, or entanglement measures, while robustness/systematics checks (as in analogue-gravity programs) act as a laboratory version of verifying that an effective description is stable under changes of coarse-graining scheme.\n\nThe **geometry/constraints** corner enters when the effective degrees of freedom admit a description in terms of a bulk metric \\(g_{ab}\\) (and associated canonical data), constrained by gauge redundancies. Canonically, gravitational dynamics is encoded not by a standard Hamiltonian evolution but by **constraints**—schematically\n\\[\nH(x)\\approx 0,\\qquad H_i(x)\\approx 0,\n\\]\nalongside Gauss-law-type constraints in gauge sectors; these enforce diffeomorphism (and internal gauge) invariance. The unification point is that *entanglement in gauge theories and gravity is constrained entanglement*: subregion factorization is subtle, and one must account for boundary/edge data (often summarized as “Gauss-law constraints at the cut”). In semiclassical limits (\\(\\hbar\\to 0\\), large-\\(N\\), or large central charge depending on context), gravitational constraints can be recast as **consistency relations** among entanglement/modular quantities across nested regions and scales. This is the technical sense in which “geometry emerges from information”: the would-be geometric dynamics is equivalent to ensuring that coarse-grained modular data is compatible with a constrained, gauge-redundant bulk description. In holographic settings (used here as an archetype rather than as a universal assumption), this is sharpened by the entanglement–geometry link: area terms plus bulk entanglement organize \\(S_A\\), and modular/relative-entropy identities translate into linearized gravitational field equations and constraint satisfaction.\n\n### Compact toolbox (variables and relations that recur across the triangle)\n\n- **Subregion state/entropy/modular data:**  \n  \\(\\rho_A=\\mathrm{Tr}_{\\bar A}\\rho\\), \\(\\;S_A=-\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_A\\log\\rho_A)\\), \\(\\;K_A=-\\log\\rho_A\\), \\(\\;U_A(s)=e^{-isK_A}\\).\n- **Relative entropy / coarse-graining monotonicity:**  \n  \\(S(\\rho_A\\Vert\\sigma_A)=\\Delta\\langle K_A^{(\\sigma)}\\rangle-\\Delta S_A\\ge 0\\), and \\(S(\\mathcal{E}[\\rho]\\Vert\\mathcal{E}[\\sigma])\\le S(\\rho\\Vert\\sigma)\\).\n- **RG scale and effective description:**  \n  \\(\\mu\\) (energy/momentum scale), \\(\\rho(\\mu)=\\mathcal{E}_\\mu[\\rho]\\), \\(S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mu)\\), \\(g_i(\\mu)\\).\n- **Bulk/geometry variables (emergent description):**  \n  metric \\(g_{ab}\\) (and derived curvatures), plus canonical constraints \\(H\\approx 0\\), \\(H_i\\approx 0\\);

CANDIDATE UNIFIED FRAMEWORKS (2–3 SKETCHES) FOR RECONCILING CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM DESCRIPTIONS\n\n## III. Candidate Unified Frameworks (2–3 Sketches) for Reconciling Classical and Quantum Descriptions\n\nA pragmatic reconciliation program across the branches is to treat *“classical spacetime + classical outcomes”* as *emergent*, but to allow multiple—and testably distinct—emergence mechanisms. The common core motif is that geometry is reconstructed from quantum information (entanglement/relative entropy/operator algebras) of more fundamental degrees of freedom, while “classicality” arises when phase information is either (i) redundantly encoded and robust under coarse-graining (large‑\\(N\\), saddle points, quantum error correction), or (ii) genuinely lost into inaccessible degrees of freedom (open-system decoherence). Below are three candidate frameworks that integrate these motifs into coherent mechanisms. They overlap on entanglement as the organizing diagnostic, but discriminate sharply on *where dynamics lives* (boundary QFT vs. effective elastic medium vs. intrinsic gravitational noise), *what limit produces classicality* (large‑\\(N\\)/saddles vs. hydrodynamic coarse-graining vs. irreducible dephasing), and *how falsification should proceed* (entanglement kernels, defect/avalanche statistics, or height-/mass-dependent coherence bounds).\n\n### Framework A — Holographic Entanglement / Quantum Error-Correcting (QEC) Bulk Reconstruction (Large‑\\(N\\) Saddle)\n**(1) Core postulates/assumptions.** A non-gravitational quantum system (typically a large‑\\(N\\), strongly coupled QFT) provides a complete microscopic description; semiclassical gravity is an *effective* description of a code subspace of states. Geometric connectivity is determined by entanglement structure, and bulk locality is approximate—protected by a QEC structure that makes bulk operators reconstructible from multiple boundary regions.  \n**(2) Formal outline (minimal equations, DOF).** Boundary degrees of freedom: operator algebra \\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\partial}\\), state \\(\\rho\\), large parameter \\(N\\). Bulk degrees of freedom: emergent metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and low-energy fields \\(\\phi\\) defined only within a code subspace. The key “entanglement → geometry” map is encoded by RT/HRT and relative-entropy identities:\n\\[\nS(A)\\;\\approx\\;\\frac{\\mathrm{Area}(\\gamma_A)}{4G_N}+S_{\\text{bulk}}(\\Sigma_A),\n\\qquad\n\\delta S_A \\sim \\delta\\langle K_A\\rangle \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\delta g_{\\mu\\nu}\\ \\text{(linearized)}.\n\\]\n**(3) Classical limit emergence.** Classical spacetime appears in the combined limit of large \\(N\\) (suppressing quantum fluctuations \\(G_N\\sim N^{-2}\\)) and a saddle-point/semiclassical expansion; decoherence of macroscopic observables is then explained either by environment tracing (standard open-system physics) or by coarse-graining over inaccessible microscopic boundary data.  \n**(4) Gravity/spacetime emergence.** Geometry is reconstructed from entanglement wedges and operator reconstruction; gravitational dynamics emerges as the consistency conditions of entanglement (e.g., “entanglement first law”/relative entropy constraints implying linearized Einstein equations in suitable regimes).  \n**Empirical signatures & challenges.** Most direct tests are *synthetic*: compute entanglement response kernels in deformed (nonconformal) holographic toy models; look for universal fingerprints (mutual information decay, entanglement spectrum structure, OTOC growth) that can be emulated in quantum simulators. Key challenge: separating universal entanglement→geometry features from genuinely stringy/UV-sensitive ones, especially at finite \\(N\\) and finite system size.\n\n### Framework B — Entanglement Coarse-Graining → Emergent “Elastic Geometry” EFT with Defects (Hydrodynamic/Defect Limit)\n**(1) Core postulates/assumptions.** The “elastic/defect” language is treated not as fundamental spacetime substance but as an *effective continuum* arising from coarse-graining entanglement networks (tensor networks, MERA-like RG circuits, or modular-flow data). Curvature corresponds to inhomogeneous entanglement/strain; localized nonperturbative excitations (defects/brane-like objects) are collective modes whose dynamics backreacts on the emergent geometry.  \n**(2) Formal outline (minimal equations, DOF).** Microscopic variables: a graph/tensor network with bond data encoding entanglement; coarse-grained fields: displacement \\(u^i(x)\\), strain \\(\\epsilon_{ij}=\\tfrac12(\\partial_i u_j+\\partial_j u_i)\\), elastic moduli \\(\\lambda,\\mu\\), plus defect density \\(J^{\\mu\\nu}\\) (dislocations/disclinations as sources). A minimal EFT sketch is:\n\\[\nS_{\\text{eff}}=\\int d^dx\\;\\Big[\\mu\\,\\epsilon_{ij}\\epsilon_{ij}+\\frac{\\lambda}{2}(\\epsilon^i{}_i)^2\\Big]\\;+\\;S_{\\text{defects}}[J]\\;+\\;\\cdots\n\\]\nwith curvature-like responses tied to defect/strain incompatibility constraints.  \n**(3) Classical limit emergence.** Classical geometry appears in a hydrodynamic/large‑scale limit where many microscopic entanglement links are coarse-grained into smooth fields; stochasticity and apparent irreversibility can arise from defect proliferation/avalanche dynamics (an explicit mechanism for entropy production consistent with decoherence-as-information-leakage).  \n**(4) Gravity/spacetime emergence.** Spacetime is reconstructed as the continuum description of entanglement connectivity; “Einstein-like” dynamics is posited to arise as a constrained elasticity theory (gauge redundancy corresponding to diffeomorphism-like reparameterizations) plus defect backreaction.  \n**Empirical signatures & challenges.** Discriminators include non-Gaussian, scale-dependent fluctuation statistics (defect avalanches), and possible cascade/RG interpretations of energy transfer (a controlled version would relate scale-to-scale transport to operator mixing/entanglement renormalization). The central challenge is *discipline*: specifying the coarse-graining map from a microscopic quantum state to elastic variables and showing when diffeomorphism invariance is recovered rather than imposed.\n\n### Framework C — Intrinsic Gravitationally Induced Decoherence / Relational Time as an Open-System Channel (Classicality from Irreducible Dephasing)\n**(1) Core postulates/assumptions.** In addition to ordinary environmental decoherence, there exists an *irreducible* dephasing channel tied to gravitational time dilation or fluctuations of relational time/geometry. This makes classical outcomes inevitable beyond a mass/separation/potential threshold, even under ideal engineering control.  \n**(2) Formal outline (minimal equations, DOF).** System degrees of freedom (e.g., a massive superposition or “clock” states) couple to a gravitational/time variable treated as unmonitored environment. A minimal master-equation sketch is:\n\\[\n\\dot\\rho = -i[H,\\rho] - \\Gamma_g\\, [A,[A,\\rho]] + \\cdots\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) encodes the “which-path in proper time” observable and \\(\\Gamma_g\\) depends on gravitational potential differences and internal energy/clock rate shifts (model-dependent).  \n**(3) Classical limit emergence.** Classicality is produced directly by dephasing in the “time/phase” basis: coherence between different proper-time histories is suppressed first, implying an ordering such as “superpositions of *when* decohere before superpositions of *where*” in appropriate setups.  \n**(4) Gravity/spacetime emergence.** Unlike A/B (where gravity emerges from entanglement constraints), here semiclassical spacetime is taken as an effective background that *induces* decoherence; the unification claim is that the same mechanism that stabilizes classical spacetime also limits quantum coherence of sufficiently massive/clock-like systems.  \n**Empirical signatures & challenges.** The key discriminator is *residual decoherence* that persists after aggressive noise spectroscopy, dynamical decoupling, and error correction, scaling with gravitational potential difference (height), mass, or clock-energy splitting. The primary challenge is producing unambiguous predictions that cannot be mimicked by low-frequency technical noise and that remain consistent with existing interferometry and precision-clock bounds.\n\n---\n\n### Side-by-side comparison table (inputs → mechanism → outputs)\n\n| Framework | Microscopic inputs (DOF, regime) | Mechanism (reconciliation map) | Outputs (classical limit + spacetime/gravity) | Overlaps | Discriminators / test handles |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **A.

Framework C is the clean discriminator: if an environment-insensitive, gravity-scaling residual decoherence channel is observed, it forces any A/B-style emergence story to incorporate an additional, effectively fundamental noise source; if not observed within sensitivity, A/B retain the status of the leading reconciliation mechanisms with classicality attributed to controllable/open-system decoherence plus large‑\\(N\\)/coarse-graining.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## IV. EMPIRICAL SIGNATURES, SIMULATION PATHWAYS, AND PRIORITY THEORETICAL CHALLENGES\n\n## IV. Empirical Signatures, Simulation Pathways, and Priority Theoretical Challenges\n\nA unifying empirical theme across the entanglement→geometry programs is that “bulk” structure should be reconstructible from *operational* boundary data: entanglement entropies and spectra, modular Hamiltonian response, correlation structure, and dynamical probes of scrambling. In holography-inspired frameworks (Branches 1 & 3), the most discriminating observables are (i) **entanglement–area relations** (Ryu–Takayanagi/HRT scaling and its corrections), (ii) **entanglement wedge / error-correction behavior** (how robustly bulk information is encoded against loss of boundary degrees of freedom), and (iii) **complexity growth and chaos diagnostics** (OTOCs, spectral form factors) that correlate with semiclassical horizons. The practical measurement strategy is to avoid full state tomography and instead use **entanglement tomography proxies**: randomized measurements (classical shadows) to estimate Rényi entropies, mutual information profiles, and entanglement spectra; swap tests and interference-based protocols (where available); and “operator growth” probes via Heisenberg evolution of local operators. A particularly sharp discriminator is **modular response**: small perturbations of a subregion and measurement of relative entropy / modular Hamiltonian variation. In controlled holographic regimes, first-law-like relations (e.g., \\(\\delta S_A = \\delta \\langle K_A\\rangle\\)) and their nonlinear extensions are expected to map to *linearized* and eventually *nonlinear* bulk metric response; failures (after accounting for finite-size and finite-\\(N\\) corrections) would directly constrain which entanglement-to-geometry kernels are viable.\n\nQuantum simulation provides the most immediate route to stress-testing the *universality* claims implicit in emergent-geometry pictures. A near-term pathway is to engineer Hamiltonians whose low-energy sector approximates CFT-like behavior (1D critical chains; 2D lattice gauge-theory-inspired models), then **quench** and monitor entanglement growth, mutual information light-cones, and thermalization. The key “geometry” signature is not literal extra dimensions but the *pattern* of connectivity inferred from data-driven reconstructions (tensor-network fitting, MERA-inspired coarse-graining, or learned graph embeddings): holographic-like states predict specific hierarchies in mutual information and conditional mutual information, and a characteristic robustness reminiscent of quantum error-correcting codes. In parallel, **complexity/scrambling diagnostics** can be implemented by measuring OTOCs (or experimentally friendlier surrogates such as echo protocols and randomized compiling estimators) and comparing the inferred Lyapunov-like growth, operator front velocities, and entanglement velocities across models. A discriminating prediction here is *co-variation*: in holographic toy models one expects a tight relationship between fast scrambling, hydrodynamic relaxation, and entanglement-wedge “thickness” (how rapidly bulk regions become reconstructible from boundary subregions). By contrast, generic chaotic lattice systems can scramble quickly without exhibiting holographic-style redundancy; observing (or not observing) the redundancy and correctability structure—e.g., by deliberately erasing subsets of qubits and testing reconstruction fidelity—provides a practical falsification lever for claims of universality.\n\nThe more speculative “defect/elastic/turbulence” branch (Branch 2) can still be rendered discriminating if it is tied to specific scaling laws and RG invariants rather than broad analogies. The relevant empirical lever is **universality in RG flows and cascade-like dynamics**: if turbulence or cascade phenomenology is claimed to encode microscopic string/worldsheet data, then one should specify which operator families control the flow, what fixed-point data (critical exponents, OPE-like coefficients) are predicted, and how these imprint on measurable quantities (structure functions, intermittency exponents, or entanglement scaling under coarse-graining). A concrete protocol—aligned with the rest of the program—is to build *toy* 2D or quasi-1D systems where energy transfer across scales can be computed and compared to operator mixing under RG, then test whether entanglement production and operator growth exhibit the proposed cascade universality. The same logic applies to claims that near-horizon chaos reveals stringy parameters: rather than “chaos implies strings,” one demands a calibrated mapping between **OTOC growth / spectral statistics** and an effective tension or defect density that is stable under deformations and consistent with known EFT/gravity constraints. If such a mapping fails across controlled deformations (finite size, weak/strong coupling proxies, symmetry changes), it rules out the strong identification; if it persists, it becomes a nontrivial bridge between phenomenology and microscopic completion.\n\nAcross all branches, the priority theoretical challenges are tightly coupled to what can be operationally measured. (1) **Define bulk observables and their algebra** in a way that is state-dependent but not ambiguous: what, precisely, is being reconstructed (metric, causal structure, connection, entanglement wedge) and what boundary data suffice? (2) **Nonperturbative completion and consistency filters**: any proposed emergent geometry must respect UV constraints (causality, absence of global symmetries, positivity bounds, swampland-style restrictions), otherwise simulator “geometries” may correspond to inconsistent EFTs. (3) **Locality vs. entanglement tension**: determine when local bulk dynamics emerges from highly nonlocal boundary entanglement, and identify diagnostics (e.g., conditional mutual information patterns, code distances, modular flow locality) that sharply separate “geometric” from merely “correlated” states. (4) **Time and dynamics**: extend from static RT-like relations to real-time reconstruction (HRT, modular flow, operator growth), including how semiclassicality breaks down and what experimental signatures (deviations from ETH-like thermalization, anomalous complexity growth, non-hydrodynamic relaxation channels) would mark that transition. (5) **Contact with known EFT/gravity constraints**: translate simulator-accessible observables—entanglement spectra, modular response, OTOCs—into bounds or parameters recognizable in gravity (effective couplings, higher-derivative corrections, chaos bounds, quasinormal-mode structure). Progress on these five fronts is what turns “emergence” from an interpretive narrative into a program with discriminating predictions and genuine failure modes.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Lack of a concrete micro-to-macro dictionary linking geometric variables to information/RG degrees of freedom. While the corpus repeatedly invokes a Geometry–Information–RG triangle (e.g., entanglement entropy ↔ area, modular Hamiltonians ↔ local boosts, coarse-graining flow ↔ radial holographic direction), there is no universally agreed, model-independent map specifying: (a) the microscopic Hilbert space and operator algebras whose RG flow reproduce continuum spacetime metrics and connection data; (b) the precise coarse-graining variables (which tensors, spectra, or code subspaces) that play the role of geometric tensors; and (c) the conditions under which this map yields Lorentzian signature, causal structure, and local energy conditions. Key unanswered questions: Which microscopic architectures (tensor networks, algebraic QFT nets, spin systems with long-range constraints) can realize the required dictionary? What are the necessary and sufficient entanglement/complexity constraints to recover smooth semiclassical geometry? How unique/stable is the emergent geometry under perturbations of microscopic data?\n- Gap 2: Incomplete treatment of dynamical decoherence, backreaction and nonperturbative quantum-to-classical transitions in emergent gravity scenarios. The synthesis uses effective field theory and perturbative RG to connect quantum entanglement structures to semiclassical Einstein dynamics, but it lacks: (a) a controlled, nonperturbative description of how entanglement dynamics produce classical metric degrees of freedom and their stochastic fluctuations (including dissipation, noise kernels, and stochastic gravity limits); (b) an explicit account of backreaction from matter quantum fluctuations on the micro-to-macro mapping, especially near horizons/singularities; and (c) a rigorous derivation of when and how classical causal structure and locality reappear (pointer states, einselection) instead of generic quantum superpositions. Key unanswered questions: What are the timescales and scales for decoherence that produce classical geometry? Can one derive a master equation (with identified Lindblad operators or influence functionals) for emergent metric variables from explicit microscopic models? How do nonperturbative phenomena (instanton-like effects, topology change) affect the semiclassical limit?\n- Gap 3: Sparse connection between proposed unified frameworks and concrete empirical/ simulation pathways. Candidate frameworks are sketched (e.g., geometry-as-entanglement, RG-as-radial-evolution, gauge/constraint emergence), but there is insufficient development of operational signatures, measurement protocols, and scalable computational tests. Missing are: (a) explicit observables and experimental thresholds that would falsify or support each candidate (e.g., specific corrections to gravitational wave dispersion, entanglement-induced noise spectra near horizons, modified cosmological correlators); (b) numerical algorithms and resource estimates to simulate the proposed micro-macro maps at relevant scales (e.g., requirements for tensor-network sizes, quantum simulators, or Monte Carlo schemes to capture emergent Lorentz symmetry); and (c) strategies to disentangle competing frameworks observationally. Key unanswered questions: What are the minimal, model-independent empirical signatures to target? What simulation architectures (classical HPC, analog quantum simulators, hybrid approaches) can realistically probe the necessary regime, and what are their scaling bottlenecks?\n\n","nodeId":null,"timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:06:43.975Z","memoryStorageFailed":true},{"type":"synthesis_report","content":"# SYNTHESIS REPORT\n\n**Mission:** Analyze the curated corpus to extract common mathematical patterns and conceptual motifs (e.g., symmetry principles, gauge structures, effective field theory, renormalization, entanglement structures, emergent degrees of freedom). From these, propose 2–3 candidate unified frameworks (sketches) that map how classical and quantum descriptions could be reconciled under specific assumptions; provide formal outlines (equations, key variables), expected empirical signatures, and prioritized theoretical challenges.\n\n**Generated:** 2025-12-22T19:06:43.513Z\n**Sources:** 7 memory nodes\n**Sections:** 8\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAcross the curated corpus, the most persistent invariants are *constraint-first* structures rather than specific microscopic models: gauge and diffeomorphism redundancies (and their constraint algebras), locality emerging from compatibility conditions on algebras of observables, and a repeated “geometry–information–RG” linkage in which entanglement patterns both define and diagnose effective spacetime geometry. A common mathematical backbone appears as (i) **information/entanglement** (area-law structure, relative entropy, modular flow), (ii) **coarse-graining/renormalization** (effective field theory, universality, flow of couplings/operator algebras), and (iii) **emergent geometry** (metric/connection data reconstructed from entanglement and consistency constraints). This triangle explains why disparate approaches converge on similar motifs: classical spacetime is treated as a robust *fixed point/sector* stabilized by symmetry and RG, while quantum descriptions emphasize relational observables and redundancy.\n\nFrom these motifs, the synthesis supports 2–3 plausible reconciliation sketches: **(1) Entanglement-to-geometry + RG** frameworks (e.g., tensor-network/holographic-style reconstructions) where geometry is an emergent parameterization of entanglement data and semiclassical gravity corresponds to a constrained extremum principle; **(2) Constraint/Algebra-first quantum gravity**, where quantization is applied to the constraint algebra and classical spacetime arises in semiclassical representations of the observable algebra; and **(3) Effective-field-theory-with-emergent-symmetry** views, where gravity is the universal long-distance theory consistent with locality, unitarity, and symmetry, with classicality arising from decoherence and RG stability. The report highlights empirical and simulation priorities common to all: search for **universal, model-agnostic signatures** (modified dispersion/propagation, consistency relations in entanglement spectra, quantum-gravity corrections to effective couplings), develop **operational reconstruction tests** (bulk-from-boundary/information-complete tomography), and resolve key theoretical bottlenecks—maintaining gauge-invariant locality, controlling RG flows of operator algebras, and deriving classical outcomes (decoherence and measurement) without ad hoc collapse.\n\n---\n\n## I. CROSS-CORPUS MOTIFS: SHARED MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES AND CONCEPTUAL INVARIANTS\n\n## I. Cross-Corpus Motifs: Shared Mathematical Structures and Conceptual Invariants\n\nAcross the corpus, the most stable “conceptual invariants” are not specific microscopic models but *constraint-first* structures: redundancies (diffeomorphisms, gauge symmetry, reparameterizations), their associated Ward/Slavnov–Taylor identities, and the operational insistence that physical statements be phrased in terms of gauge-invariant observables (or relational/operational ones when local observables are obstructed). This theme appears both in mathematically controlled QFT foundations (AQFT/pAQFT and related locality/covariance principles) and in quantum-gravity programs whose canonical formulations are literally built from constraints (Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints; projector-to-constraints logic in covariant/spinfoam-like settings). The recurring role of these structures is to (i) delimit the *space of admissible effective theories* and (ii) provide “non-negotiable” consistency conditions that survive changes of variables, regulators, or discretizations—precisely the kind of cross-community common ground highlighted by the corpus’s emphasis on reducing interpretive drift via formal constraints and calculational control.\n\nA second motif is the repeated identification of *entanglement/information as a geometric organizing principle*, most sharply instantiated in holography but echoed more broadly whenever entropy and correlation structures serve as “order parameters” for emergent spacetime behavior. In this framing, area-law scaling, modular Hamiltonians, and relative entropy become geometric diagnostics: they govern what can be reconstructed, what is protected against perturbations, and how semiclassical locality is encoded in nonlocal microscopic degrees of freedom. Even when a full AdS/CFT dictionary is not assumed, the corpus repeatedly returns to the same formal triangle—(i) geometric entropy functionals, (ii) entanglement wedges / reconstruction maps, and (iii) error-correction-like protection of bulk information—because it provides a template for how classical geometry can arise from quantum correlations while remaining compatible with gauge redundancy (subregion duality and edge/boundary degrees of freedom being a canonical example of this interplay).\n\nA third cross-cutting invariant is *EFT logic plus universality*: whatever the microscopic completion, viable semiclassical physics is expected to emerge through controlled coarse-graining, decoupling, and symmetry-constrained operator expansions. This is the point where the corpus’s “RG/coarse-graining as unifier” becomes technically meaningful: renormalization is treated less as a computational trick and more as the *scale-bridging mechanism* that explains why many inequivalent micro-theories can share the same infrared behavior (effective diffeomorphism invariance, approximate locality, and familiar field content). The same logic also underwrites the corpus’s benchmark-oriented attitude: rather than adjudicating interpretations, one targets observables that are stable under coarse-graining (correlators, entanglement measures, noise/decoherence spectra, robustness/systematics in analogue settings), and then asks whether candidate microscopic models reproduce those invariants without fine-tuning.\n\nFinally, the corpus repeatedly highlights *emergent degrees of freedom*—collective modes, boundary/edge variables, and relational observables—as the practical bridge between “microscopic” descriptions (discrete structures, constrained phase spaces, or dual quantum systems) and “macroscopic” semiclassical fields. This is where information-theoretic structures and constraint principles meet: gauge redundancy forces a careful accounting of what counts as a subsystem; that accounting, in turn, naturally introduces boundary terms and modular data (modular Hamiltonians, relative entropy) that behave like new effective variables. Across approaches, the conceptual role is consistent: emergent variables are not optional embellishments but the bookkeeping devices that make locality, thermality, and geometry simultaneously compatible with (i) gauge constraints and (ii) coarse-grained universality.\n\n---\n\n### Categorized Motif Map (structures → representative equations → conceptual role)\n\n| Motif (shared structure) | Representative equations (schematic) | Conceptual role / cross-links |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Gauge/diffeomorphism redundancy; constraint-first dynamics** | Constraints: \\(\\mathcal{H}\\approx 0,\\ \\mathcal{H}_i\\approx 0\\).

FORMAL SYNTHESIS: COMMON MATHEMATICAL BACKBONE (GEOMETRY–INFORMATION–RG TRIANGLE)\n\n## II. Formal Synthesis: Common Mathematical Backbone (Geometry–Information–RG Triangle)\n\nA common mathematical scaffold across otherwise distinct quantum-gravity programs can be organized as a **triangle linking (i) information/entanglement, (ii) coarse-graining/RG, and (iii) emergent geometry with gravitational constraints**. On the **information** corner, the central objects are reduced states \\(\\rho_A\\), entanglement entropies \\(S_A=-\\mathrm{Tr}\\,\\rho_A\\log\\rho_A\\), and the **modular Hamiltonian** \\(K_A:=-\\log \\rho_A\\), whose modular flow \\(U_A(s)=e^{-isK_A}\\) packages “intrinsic” dynamics seen by subregions. A key control quantity is **relative entropy**\n\\[\nS(\\rho_A\\Vert\\sigma_A)=\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_A\\log\\rho_A-\\rho_A\\log\\sigma_A)=\\Delta\\langle K_A^{(\\sigma)}\\rangle-\\Delta S_A,\n\\]\nwhich is nonnegative and monotone under coarse-graining; this monotonicity is the information-theoretic backbone behind “irreversibility” statements that also appear as RG monotones in effective descriptions. In semiclassical regimes (where a state is close to a reference, e.g. vacuum), the **entanglement first law** \\(\\delta S_A=\\delta\\langle K_A\\rangle\\) makes the bridge to dynamics: small variations of entropy are equivalent to variations of a (generally nonlocal) generator, suggesting that “equations of motion” can be reframed as consistency conditions on modular data.\n\nThe **RG/coarse-graining** corner supplies the operational meaning of “scale” and “emergence,” aligning with the cross-program framing (special-issue/editorial mapping) that treats RG/coarse-graining as a unifying technical thread. Abstractly, coarse-graining is a map \\(\\mathcal{E}_\\mu\\) (often taken CPTP in quantum-information language) producing an effective state \\(\\rho(\\mu)=\\mathcal{E}_\\mu[\\rho]\\) at RG scale \\(\\mu\\). The same move can be expressed in QFT terms as integrating out modes above \\(\\mu\\), yielding an effective action \\(S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mu)\\) and running couplings \\(g_i(\\mu)\\). The information-theoretic and RG languages become interchangeable once one fixes the “kept observables” \\(\\mathcal{O}_{\\le\\mu}\\): relative entropy \\(S(\\rho(\\mu)\\Vert\\sigma(\\mu))\\) quantifies distinguishability *at scale \\(\\mu\\)* and is guaranteed to decrease as one discards UV detail. In gravity-sensitive settings (e.g., decoherence/noise benchmarks, QFT observables on discrete structures), this becomes practical: “what survives coarse-graining” is precisely what remains diagnosable in spectra, correlators, or entanglement measures, while robustness/systematics checks (as in analogue-gravity programs) act as a laboratory version of verifying that an effective description is stable under changes of coarse-graining scheme.\n\nThe **geometry/constraints** corner enters when the effective degrees of freedom admit a description in terms of a bulk metric \\(g_{ab}\\) (and associated canonical data), constrained by gauge redundancies. Canonically, gravitational dynamics is encoded not by a standard Hamiltonian evolution but by **constraints**—schematically\n\\[\nH(x)\\approx 0,\\qquad H_i(x)\\approx 0,\n\\]\nalongside Gauss-law-type constraints in gauge sectors; these enforce diffeomorphism (and internal gauge) invariance. The unification point is that *entanglement in gauge theories and gravity is constrained entanglement*: subregion factorization is subtle, and one must account for boundary/edge data (often summarized as “Gauss-law constraints at the cut”). In semiclassical limits (\\(\\hbar\\to 0\\), large-\\(N\\), or large central charge depending on context), gravitational constraints can be recast as **consistency relations** among entanglement/modular quantities across nested regions and scales. This is the technical sense in which “geometry emerges from information”: the would-be geometric dynamics is equivalent to ensuring that coarse-grained modular data is compatible with a constrained, gauge-redundant bulk description. In holographic settings (used here as an archetype rather than as a universal assumption), this is sharpened by the entanglement–geometry link: area terms plus bulk entanglement organize \\(S_A\\), and modular/relative-entropy identities translate into linearized gravitational field equations and constraint satisfaction.\n\n### Compact toolbox (variables and relations that recur across the triangle)\n\n- **Subregion state/entropy/modular data:**  \n  \\(\\rho_A=\\mathrm{Tr}_{\\bar A}\\rho\\), \\(\\;S_A=-\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_A\\log\\rho_A)\\), \\(\\;K_A=-\\log\\rho_A\\), \\(\\;U_A(s)=e^{-isK_A}\\).\n- **Relative entropy / coarse-graining monotonicity:**  \n  \\(S(\\rho_A\\Vert\\sigma_A)=\\Delta\\langle K_A^{(\\sigma)}\\rangle-\\Delta S_A\\ge 0\\), and \\(S(\\mathcal{E}[\\rho]\\Vert\\mathcal{E}[\\sigma])\\le S(\\rho\\Vert\\sigma)\\).\n- **RG scale and effective description:**  \n  \\(\\mu\\) (energy/momentum scale), \\(\\rho(\\mu)=\\mathcal{E}_\\mu[\\rho]\\), \\(S_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mu)\\), \\(g_i(\\mu)\\).\n- **Bulk/geometry variables (emergent description):**  \n  metric \\(g_{ab}\\) (and derived curvatures), plus canonical constraints \\(H\\approx 0\\), \\(H_i\\approx 0\\);

CANDIDATE UNIFIED FRAMEWORKS (2–3 SKETCHES) FOR RECONCILING CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM DESCRIPTIONS\n\n## III. Candidate Unified Frameworks (2–3 Sketches) for Reconciling Classical and Quantum Descriptions\n\nA pragmatic reconciliation program across the branches is to treat *“classical spacetime + classical outcomes”* as *emergent*, but to allow multiple—and testably distinct—emergence mechanisms. The common core motif is that geometry is reconstructed from quantum information (entanglement/relative entropy/operator algebras) of more fundamental degrees of freedom, while “classicality” arises when phase information is either (i) redundantly encoded and robust under coarse-graining (large‑\\(N\\), saddle points, quantum error correction), or (ii) genuinely lost into inaccessible degrees of freedom (open-system decoherence). Below are three candidate frameworks that integrate these motifs into coherent mechanisms. They overlap on entanglement as the organizing diagnostic, but discriminate sharply on *where dynamics lives* (boundary QFT vs. effective elastic medium vs. intrinsic gravitational noise), *what limit produces classicality* (large‑\\(N\\)/saddles vs. hydrodynamic coarse-graining vs. irreducible dephasing), and *how falsification should proceed* (entanglement kernels, defect/avalanche statistics, or height-/mass-dependent coherence bounds).\n\n### Framework A — Holographic Entanglement / Quantum Error-Correcting (QEC) Bulk Reconstruction (Large‑\\(N\\) Saddle)\n**(1) Core postulates/assumptions.** A non-gravitational quantum system (typically a large‑\\(N\\), strongly coupled QFT) provides a complete microscopic description; semiclassical gravity is an *effective* description of a code subspace of states. Geometric connectivity is determined by entanglement structure, and bulk locality is approximate—protected by a QEC structure that makes bulk operators reconstructible from multiple boundary regions.  \n**(2) Formal outline (minimal equations, DOF).** Boundary degrees of freedom: operator algebra \\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\partial}\\), state \\(\\rho\\), large parameter \\(N\\). Bulk degrees of freedom: emergent metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and low-energy fields \\(\\phi\\) defined only within a code subspace. The key “entanglement → geometry” map is encoded by RT/HRT and relative-entropy identities:\n\\[\nS(A)\\;\\approx\\;\\frac{\\mathrm{Area}(\\gamma_A)}{4G_N}+S_{\\text{bulk}}(\\Sigma_A),\n\\qquad\n\\delta S_A \\sim \\delta\\langle K_A\\rangle \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\delta g_{\\mu\\nu}\\ \\text{(linearized)}.\n\\]\n**(3) Classical limit emergence.** Classical spacetime appears in the combined limit of large \\(N\\) (suppressing quantum fluctuations \\(G_N\\sim N^{-2}\\)) and a saddle-point/semiclassical expansion; decoherence of macroscopic observables is then explained either by environment tracing (standard open-system physics) or by coarse-graining over inaccessible microscopic boundary data.  \n**(4) Gravity/spacetime emergence.** Geometry is reconstructed from entanglement wedges and operator reconstruction; gravitational dynamics emerges as the consistency conditions of entanglement (e.g., “entanglement first law”/relative entropy constraints implying linearized Einstein equations in suitable regimes).  \n**Empirical signatures & challenges.** Most direct tests are *synthetic*: compute entanglement response kernels in deformed (nonconformal) holographic toy models; look for universal fingerprints (mutual information decay, entanglement spectrum structure, OTOC growth) that can be emulated in quantum simulators. Key challenge: separating universal entanglement→geometry features from genuinely stringy/UV-sensitive ones, especially at finite \\(N\\) and finite system size.\n\n### Framework B — Entanglement Coarse-Graining → Emergent “Elastic Geometry” EFT with Defects (Hydrodynamic/Defect Limit)\n**(1) Core postulates/assumptions.** The “elastic/defect” language is treated not as fundamental spacetime substance but as an *effective continuum* arising from coarse-graining entanglement networks (tensor networks, MERA-like RG circuits, or modular-flow data).

The central challenge is *discipline*: specifying the coarse-graining map from a microscopic quantum state to elastic variables and showing when diffeomorphism invariance is recovered rather than imposed.\n\n### Framework C — Intrinsic Gravitationally Induced Decoherence / Relational Time as an Open-System Channel (Classicality from Irreducible Dephasing)\n**(1) Core postulates/assumptions.** In addition to ordinary environmental decoherence, there exists an *irreducible* dephasing channel tied to gravitational time dilation or fluctuations of relational time/geometry. This makes classical outcomes inevitable beyond a mass/separation/potential threshold, even under ideal engineering control.  \n**(2) Formal outline (minimal equations, DOF).** System degrees of freedom (e.g., a massive superposition or “clock” states) couple to a gravitational/time variable treated as unmonitored environment.

The primary challenge is producing unambiguous predictions that cannot be mimicked by low-frequency technical noise and that remain consistent with existing interferometry and precision-clock bounds.\n\n---\n\n### Side-by-side comparison table (inputs → mechanism → outputs)\n\n| Framework | Microscopic inputs (DOF, regime) | Mechanism (reconciliation map) | Outputs (classical limit + spacetime/gravity) | Overlaps | Discriminators / test handles |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **A.

EMPIRICAL SIGNATURES, SIMULATION PATHWAYS, AND PRIORITY THEORETICAL CHALLENGES\n\n## IV. Empirical Signatures, Simulation Pathways, and Priority Theoretical Challenges\n\nA unifying empirical theme across the entanglement→geometry programs is that “bulk” structure should be reconstructible from *operational* boundary data: entanglement entropies and spectra, modular Hamiltonian response, correlation structure, and dynamical probes of scrambling. In holography-inspired frameworks (Branches 1 & 3), the most discriminating observables are (i) **entanglement–area relations** (Ryu–Takayanagi/HRT scaling and its corrections), (ii) **entanglement wedge / error-correction behavior** (how robustly bulk information is encoded against loss of boundary degrees of freedom), and (iii) **complexity growth and chaos diagnostics** (OTOCs, spectral form factors) that correlate with semiclassical horizons. The practical measurement strategy is to avoid full state tomography and instead use **entanglement tomography proxies**: randomized measurements (classical shadows) to estimate Rényi entropies, mutual information profiles, and entanglement spectra; swap tests and interference-based protocols (where available); and “operator growth” probes via Heisenberg evolution of local operators. A particularly sharp discriminator is **modular response**: small perturbations of a subregion and measurement of relative entropy / modular Hamiltonian variation. In controlled holographic regimes, first-law-like relations (e.g., \\(\\delta S_A = \\delta \\langle K_A\\rangle\\)) and their nonlinear extensions are expected to map to *linearized* and eventually *nonlinear* bulk metric response; failures (after accounting for finite-size and finite-\\(N\\) corrections) would directly constrain which entanglement-to-geometry kernels are viable.\n\nQuantum simulation provides the most immediate route to stress-testing the *universality* claims implicit in emergent-geometry pictures. A near-term pathway is to engineer Hamiltonians whose low-energy sector approximates CFT-like behavior (1D critical chains; 2D lattice gauge-theory-inspired models), then **quench** and monitor entanglement growth, mutual information light-cones, and thermalization. The key “geometry” signature is not literal extra dimensions but the *pattern* of connectivity inferred from data-driven reconstructions (tensor-network fitting, MERA-inspired coarse-graining, or learned graph embeddings): holographic-like states predict specific hierarchies in mutual information and conditional mutual information, and a characteristic robustness reminiscent of quantum error-correcting codes. In parallel, **complexity/scrambling diagnostics** can be implemented by measuring OTOCs (or experimentally friendlier surrogates such as echo protocols and randomized compiling estimators) and comparing the inferred Lyapunov-like growth, operator front velocities, and entanglement velocities across models. A discriminating prediction here is *co-variation*: in holographic toy models one expects a tight relationship between fast scrambling, hydrodynamic relaxation, and entanglement-wedge “thickness” (how rapidly bulk regions become reconstructible from boundary subregions). By contrast, generic chaotic lattice systems can scramble quickly without exhibiting holographic-style redundancy; observing (or not observing) the redundancy and correctability structure—e.g., by deliberately erasing subsets of qubits and testing reconstruction fidelity—provides a practical falsification lever for claims of universality.\n\nThe more speculative “defect/elastic/turbulence” branch (Branch 2) can still be rendered discriminating if it is tied to specific scaling laws and RG invariants rather than broad analogies. The relevant empirical lever is **universality in RG flows and cascade-like dynamics**: if turbulence or cascade phenomenology is claimed to encode microscopic string/worldsheet data, then one should specify which operator families control the flow, what fixed-point data (critical exponents, OPE-like coefficients) are predicted, and how these imprint on measurable quantities (structure functions, intermittency exponents, or entanglement scaling under coarse-graining). A concrete protocol—aligned with the rest of the program—is to build *toy* 2D or quasi-1D systems where energy transfer across scales can be computed and compared to operator mixing under RG, then test whether entanglement production and operator growth exhibit the proposed cascade universality. The same logic applies to claims that near-horizon chaos reveals stringy parameters: rather than “chaos implies strings,” one demands a calibrated mapping between **OTOC growth / spectral statistics** and an effective tension or defect density that is stable under deformations and consistent with known EFT/gravity constraints. If such a mapping fails across controlled deformations (finite size, weak/strong coupling proxies, symmetry changes), it rules out the strong identification; if it persists, it becomes a nontrivial bridge between phenomenology and microscopic completion.\n\nAcross all branches, the priority theoretical challenges are tightly coupled to what can be operationally measured. (1) **Define bulk observables and their algebra** in a way that is state-dependent but not ambiguous: what, precisely, is being reconstructed (metric, causal structure, connection, entanglement wedge) and what boundary data suffice? (2) **Nonperturbative completion and consistency filters**: any proposed emergent geometry must respect UV constraints (causality, absence of global symmetries, positivity bounds, swampland-style restrictions), otherwise simulator “geometries” may correspond to inconsistent EFTs. (3) **Locality vs. entanglement tension**: determine when local bulk dynamics emerges from highly nonlocal boundary entanglement, and identify diagnostics (e.g., conditional mutual information patterns, code distances, modular flow locality) that sharply separate “geometric” from merely “correlated” states. (4) **Time and dynamics**: extend from static RT-like relations to real-time reconstruction (HRT, modular flow, operator growth), including how semiclassicality breaks down and what experimental signatures (deviations from ETH-like thermalization, anomalous complexity growth, non-hydrodynamic relaxation channels) would mark that transition. (5) **Contact with known EFT/gravity constraints**: translate simulator-accessible observables—entanglement spectra, modular response, OTOCs—into bounds or parameters recognizable in gravity (effective couplings, higher-derivative corrections, chaos bounds, quasinormal-mode structure). Progress on these five fronts is what turns “emergence” from an interpretive narrative into a program with discriminating predictions and genuine failure modes.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Lack of a concrete micro-to-macro dictionary linking geometric variables to information/RG degrees of freedom.

A common mathematical backbone appears as (i) **information/entanglement** (area-law structure, relative entropy, modular flow), (ii) **coarse-graining/renormalization** (effective field theory, universality, flow of couplings/operator algebras), and (iii) **emergent geometry** (metric/connection data reconstructed from entanglement and consistency constraints).

Both imply that controlling the channels of information/energy flow can control dynamical outcomes.\n- Practical consequence common to Branches 2 and 3: manipulating environmental structure (spectra, channels, geometry) can alter effective forces/thermalization/coherence.\n\n2) Conflicting points\n- Ontology and level of claim:\n  - Branch 1 is formal and well-established (Noether’s theorem in Lagrangian field theory). It asserts conservation laws follow from symmetries; that is standard and mathematically rigorous.\n  - Branch 2 makes a speculative, high-level physical claim tying quantum information gradients to spacetime curvature and treating gravity and decoherence as two faces of a single information–geometry dynamics. This is not established and can conflict with established GR/QFT unless carefully formulated.\n- Conservation and local balance:\n  - Noether’s theorem implies conserved currents associated with continuous symmetries. If Branch 2 allows spacetime to respond to information currents in ways that transfer/convert conserved quantities without an associated symmetry or accounting, it risks violating the conservation relations that Noether enforces unless those information-couplings themselves arise from an underlying symmetry or are compensated by new degrees of freedom. In short: Branch 2 as-stated may be inconsistent with Branch 1 unless formalized to respect the same conservation constraints.\n- Level of testability and mechanism:\n  - Branch 3 is concrete and experimentally actionable (spectral engineering to suppress overlap). Branch 2 is high-level and lacks specified microphysical mechanisms or experimentally accessible parameters; it therefore conflicts in practice with Branch 3’s engineering focus unless Branch 2 is reduced to testable hypotheses about how information gradients couple to local dynamics.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions\n- Short-term, practical path (experiment/theory loop)\n  1. Pursue Branch 3 actions now: engineer environmental spectral densities (Purcell filters, bandgap phononics, metamaterials) and quantify coherence gains. These experiments are low-risk, high-value and will generate clean data about how information/energy flow affects decoherence.\n  2. While doing (1), instrument and record not only coherence times but local energy/heat flow and entropy production rates to produce quantitative datasets that map information flow ↔ physical response. This creates empirical input relevant to Branch 2’s claims.\n- Medium-term theoretical consolidation\n  3. Formulate a minimal, conservative theoretical framework that can accommodate Branch 2’s intuition without violating Branch 1: (a) express “information currents” as well-defined conserved currents or as sources coupled to fields in an action principle; (b) derive corresponding Noether identities or identify the symmetry-breaking terms and their physical interpretation. This will reveal whether the info–geometry mapping can be made compatible with standard conservation laws or if new degrees of freedom are required.\n  4. From that framework derive concrete, falsifiable predictions (e.g., extra stress-energy terms proportional to information flux with a computable coupling constant, or modified decoherence rates with distinctive spatial/energy dependence).\n- Long-term, targeted experiments\n  5.

Building on holography and tensor-network ideas, the work converges on a unifying picture: spacetime geometry can be treated as an emergent, coarse-grained summary of underlying quantum information structure, with distance, connectivity, and even curvature reflecting patterns of entanglement. In this framing, “geometry” is operational and reconstructible: it is inferred from how subsystems share and distribute quantum information, not assumed as a fixed background.\n\nThe report’s key value is a concrete path from theory to testbed. It outlines an experimental program in which quantum simulators and measurement protocols reconstruct effective geometry from measurable correlations (e.g., entanglement structure, mutual information, and network reconstructions), enabling falsifiable checks of entanglement–geometry correspondences. Cross-cutting insights emphasize a stable core—geometry as a derived construct—and highlight open questions: which entanglement measures map most directly to geometric features, what dynamics preserve or destroy emergent locality, and what minimal experimental signatures would distinguish competing emergence mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n## REFRAMING QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT: FROM “NONLOCAL INFLUENCE” TO SHARED INFORMATION RESOURCE\n\nEntanglement is best understood not as a superluminal “influence” between distant objects, but as a property of a *single, nonseparable quantum state* shared across subsystems. When two particles are entangled, the key fact is that there is generally no assignment of independent local states that reproduces the observed joint statistics; the correlations live in the global wavefunction (or density operator), not in any message exchanged at measurement time. This reframing dissolves much of the mystique: what looks like an instantaneous link is instead the revelation—under local measurements—of correlations already encoded in the shared state. Interpreting entanglement this way also clarifies why it is simultaneously powerful and constrained: it can enable tasks like teleportation, device-independent cryptography, and metrology precisely because it functions as a *shared informational resource*, while still respecting no-signaling (you cannot control outcomes to transmit information faster than light).\n\nOnce entanglement is treated as a resource, the central practical question becomes: how is that resource created, maintained, and consumed under real dynamics? In open quantum systems, entanglement is fragile because “unused” environmental degrees of freedom do not remain spectators—they become correlated with the system. This leakage of information to the environment (decoherence) effectively redistributes correlations: entanglement that was concentrated between two subsystems gets diluted into larger system–environment correlations, making the reduced state of the subsystems appear classical (e.g., definite outcomes, stable records). Measurement is not a special magical act in this view; it is an extreme, engineered form of decoherence that locks information into many uncontrolled modes, producing robust classical facts through redundancy. The implication for controllability is direct: preserving entanglement is not about preventing any fundamental spooky influence, but about *controlling information flow*—which channels the system couples to, and how strongly, and with what spectral overlap.\n\nThis information-flow perspective also turns decoherence from a vague inevitability into an engineering target. Coherence is only lost efficiently into environmental modes that overlap the system’s relevant transition frequencies and coupling spectrum; in that sense, decoherence can be viewed as a *spectral mismatch problem* with actionable remedies. Techniques like Purcell-filtered resonators, bandstop filtering of electromagnetic environments, or engineered phononic bandgaps aim to shape the environmental spectral density so that the modes capable of “listening” to the qubit are suppressed, thereby extending coherence times and stabilizing entanglement. On top of passive protection, active quantum error correction and dynamical decoupling further formalize the same principle: treat noise as a quantum channel, diagnose how it exports information, then block, redirect, or correct that leakage so the shared resource remains usable.\n\nFinally, reframing entanglement as a manipulable resource sets a foundation for broader interpretive and theoretical connections. If classical outcomes—and potentially even spacetime geometry and gravitational behavior—are effective, coarse-grained manifestations of underlying quantum information dynamics, then progress comes from making the mapping explicit: model environments as channels, quantify correlation flow, and test whether any “residual” effects remain once engineered noise is controlled. This lens also motivates bridges between classical chaos and quantum many-body dynamics: classical Lyapunov spectra can be quantitatively related to quantum information scrambling rates (e.g., via out-of-time-order correlators), suggesting that regions of higher classical instability correspond to faster entanglement growth. In emergent-geometry approaches where entanglement patterns partially encode effective curvature, that link becomes a concrete hypothesis: instability → rapid scrambling → altered entanglement structure → modified effective geometry. Whether or not any specific entanglement-to-geometry map ultimately holds, the conceptual update is the same: entanglement is not an inexplicable nonlocal mechanism, but a structured, degradable, and engineerable form of shared information that becomes classical precisely when uncontrolled correlations spread.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## ENTANGLEMENT AS THE SEED OF GEOMETRY: HOLOGRAPHY AND EMERGENT SPACETIME\n\n### Entanglement as the Seed of Geometry: Holography and Emergent Spacetime\n\nA central synthesis emerging from recent work is that spacetime geometry can be reframed as a macroscopic summary of microscopic quantum information—specifically, the pattern of entanglement among underlying degrees of freedom. In the informational framing (Section 1), “structure” is what remains invariant under coarse-graining; here, geometric notions like connectivity, distance, and curvature become effective descriptors of how quantum subsystems share correlations. The holographic principle sharpens this idea by asserting that a gravitational bulk spacetime can be fully encoded in a lower-dimensional, non-gravitational quantum theory: bulk locality and classical geometry are not fundamental primitives but emergent regularities of the boundary state’s entanglement. Conceptually, this view depends on a hierarchy of claims: (i) entanglement is not merely a property *in* spacetime but a resource that can *organize* spacetime; (ii) bulk geometric relations correspond to constraints on boundary entanglement; and (iii) gravitational dynamics can be reinterpreted as dynamics of entanglement, with classical Einstein-like behavior arising in regimes where entanglement is sufficiently “smooth” and code-like.\n\nThe most concrete bridge between entanglement and geometry is the use of entanglement entropy and related measures (mutual information, modular Hamiltonians, modular flow) as geometric data. In AdS/CFT, the Ryu–Takayanagi prescription operationalizes this: the entanglement entropy of a boundary region is computed by the area of an extremal surface in the bulk, turning “how much a region is entangled” into a statement about bulk distances and bottlenecks. This provides an actionable mapping: perturbations of the boundary entanglement pattern correspond to perturbations of the bulk metric, suggesting a route to *derive* aspects of gravity from quantum information constraints rather than postulate geometry directly. A near-term synthesis target is to push beyond idealized conformal settings by computing RT surfaces (and their quantum corrections) in deformed or nonconformal AdS/CFT toy models—e.g., relevant deformations that introduce a scale—and explicitly tracking which entanglement changes reproduce which bulk metric features. This “entanglement-to-metric” program makes the conceptual dependency explicit: the emergent geometry is only as robust as the entanglement structures (and symmetry/large‑N limits) that stabilize a semiclassical bulk.\n\nA complementary thread emphasizes that the emergence of spacetime continuity and locality resembles the functioning of an error-correcting code: bulk operators are redundantly encoded in boundary degrees of freedom, and geometric locality corresponds to correctability/decodability properties of subregions. On this view, continuity is not a fundamental assumption but an emergent approximation that can fail when the entanglement code is stressed—reframing singularities or breakdowns of effective field theory as misalignments or insufficiencies of the encoding rather than literal “tears” in a manifold. This connects directly to falsifiable proposals: one can design controllable quantum simulators (cold atoms, superconducting qubits) where entanglement entropy and mutual information are measured across subregions, then apply tensor-network-inspired reconstruction to infer an effective connectivity/curvature. If the reconstructed geometry systematically deviates from what a given holographic (or string-motivated) model predicts, that model’s entanglement→geometry assumptions are testable in an experimentally accessible proxy, even if it does not realize full quantum gravity.\n\nFinally, the synthesis highlights open dependency points and cross-links to dynamical complexity. If spacetime geometry is a macroscopic statistic of entanglement, then “dynamics of geometry” should track “dynamics of entanglement,” including scrambling and thermalization. This motivates probing whether quantitative fingerprints of instability—e.g., Lyapunov spectra in classical chaotic systems and their quantum analogs in out-of-time-order correlators—can be mapped onto entanglement growth rates and thus onto effective curvature or geometric response in emergent descriptions. At the same time, consolidated findings caution against overextending classical chaos as a generator of genuinely quantum structure: classical deterministic chaos cannot reproduce entanglement or Hilbert-space interference, and when classical chaotic degrees couple to quantum systems, decoherence and measurement back-action tend to bound or suppress the persistence of classical exponential sensitivity in regimes where quantum correlations dominate. The conceptual upshot is sharp: geometry-from-entanglement programs require intrinsically quantum resources (entanglement, error correction, unitary interference), while classical chaos may at best modulate how quickly those quantum resources are generated or redistributed—suggesting a constrained but potentially observable bridge between instability, scrambling, and emergent gravitational behavior.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## FROM THEORY TO TESTBED: QUANTUM SIMULATION AND MEASUREMENT STRATEGIES\n\n### From Theory to Testbed: Quantum Simulation and Measurement Strategies\n\nA concrete experimental program for entanglement–geometry correspondences begins by treating “geometry” not as a background arena but as an inferred structure reconstructed from patterns of quantum correlations. In practice, this means engineering quantum many-body states whose entanglement graph is controllable and then asking whether a chosen holographic mapping (e.g., tensor-network/AdS-inspired prescriptions) correctly predicts an emergent bulk distance, connectivity, or curvature. Two platforms are especially well-suited: (i) **cold atoms** in optical lattices and tweezer arrays, where interactions, dimensionality, and measurement access can be tuned with high flexibility; and (ii) **superconducting-qubit processors**, where coupling graphs are programmable, gate sequences can implement explicit tensor-network circuits, and readout enables repeated tomography-like protocols. The guiding strategy is to build a “boundary” system whose entanglement structure can be systematically dialed from area-law-like to volume-law-like regimes (and through intermediate, scale-dependent structures), then compare inferred bulk features—such as the appearance of bottlenecks (minimal cuts), changes in effective curvature, or the breakdown of semiclassical behavior—against the expectations laid out in the report’s earlier theoretical sections.\n\nOn the engineering side, the most direct route is a **tunable tensor-network quantum simulator**: implement a family of circuits/states whose entanglement patterns are known by construction (e.g., MERA-like or random-circuit tensor networks with adjustable bond dimensions and layer connectivity). Superconducting qubits naturally support this approach: one can compile networks into depth-layered gates, vary **effective bond dimension** via ancilla-assisted entanglement, and modify the **coupling graph** (nearest-neighbor vs. long-range links) to emulate different “bulk” connectivities. Cold-atom platforms offer complementary control: Rydberg dressing and cavity-mediated interactions can introduce nonlocal couplings; programmable tweezer geometries can sculpt interaction graphs; and Floquet engineering can interpolate between integrable and chaotic regimes, which theory associates with distinct entanglement growth and, by holographic intuition, distinct geometric phases (more “classical” vs. more “highly quantum” emergent spacetimes). Across both platforms, deliberately introducing **noise and decoherence** is not merely a nuisance but a knob: varying dephasing or loss tests how robust a purported geometry is to imperfections, and whether the transition from semiclassical to “stringy/quantum” geometry tracks specific entanglement thresholds or scrambling rates predicted by the mapping.\n\nMeasurement strategy is the linchpin: the testbed must output quantities that operationalize “geometry.” Since full entanglement entropy is expensive, experiments can rely on **entropy proxies** and correlator-based reconstructions. For cold atoms, randomized measurements and interference protocols enable estimates of **Rényi entropies** for subsystems; for superconducting qubits, randomized compiling and classical shadows can efficiently estimate many subsystem observables. Key observables include: (1) **mutual information** \\(I(A:B)\\) across varying region sizes and separations, used as a distance-like indicator (higher mutual information implying shorter effective separation in many reconstruction schemes); (2) **connected correlators** and their spatial decay, which can be compared to geodesic-distance heuristics in emergent geometry pictures; (3) **entanglement spectrum** features (not just total entropy), since tensor-network/holographic models often constrain spectral structure more tightly than scalar entropies; and (4) **operator reconstruction fidelity**, implemented by attempting entanglement-wedge-like recovery: encode a logical operator into a larger system, erase or scramble a boundary region, and quantify how well the operator can be reconstructed from the complement. This last observable directly targets the “bulk-from-boundary” idea and provides an experimentally falsifiable link between entanglement structure and reconstructable interior degrees of freedom.\n\nInterpreting outcomes connects the lab observables back to the theoretical claims: if a specific holographic/tensor-network mapping is correct, then controlled deformations of the boundary entanglement graph (changing bond dimensions, adding/removing long-range couplings, tuning noise/scrambling) should produce **predictable, quantitative shifts** in inferred bulk structure—e.g., systematic movement of minimal-cut surfaces inferred from entropy proxies, consistent changes in effective curvature extracted from mutual-information geometry, and corresponding changes in reconstruction thresholds. Conversely, persistent mismatches—such as mutual-information-inferred distances failing to track minimal-cut predictions, or reconstruction fidelity not correlating with the entanglement patterns that the model deems “geometric”—provide a clear falsification channel and identify which assumptions in the entanglement→geometry dictionary need revision. The overarching deliverable is thus not a single demonstration but a calibrated *response function*: how emergent geometric indicators vary with experimentally tunable entanglement resources and noise. This turns the entanglement–geometry conjecture from an interpretive framework into an engineering discipline, with explicit knobs, benchmarks, and failure modes that can discriminate between semiclassical holographic behavior and regimes where “geometry” ceases to be a useful effective description.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CROSS-CUTTING INSIGHTS, OPEN QUESTIONS, AND NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n\n## Cross-Cutting Insights, Open Questions, and Next Research Directions\n\nAcross the report’s strands—string/brane emergence, turbulence/worldsheet speculation, and quantum-simulator/tensor-network routes—a stable common core has emerged: *geometry is being treated as a derived, operational construct extracted from patterns of quantum correlations*, with holography serving as the organizing metaphor and entanglement/mutual information as the primary diagnostics. This convergence is strengthened by parallel developments in other approaches: spin-foam/LQG has increasingly reframed progress in terms of **coarse-graining/renormalization toward continuum recovery and effective diffeomorphism symmetry**, echoing the same “geometry-from-structured-information + RG flow” logic even when the microscopic degrees of freedom differ. In the most experimentally mature analogue-gravity track (BEC analogue horizons), the emphasis has likewise shifted toward **correlation-based signatures** (Hawking-like particle–partner correlations, indications of entanglement) and then toward **robustness questions** (nonstationary horizon formation, backreaction, systematics). Taken together, the cross-cutting insight is that the field is moving from evocative emergence narratives to a more testable program: specify a mapping from quantum observables → candidate geometric data, then stress-test that mapping under realistic noise, finite-size, and nonideal dynamics.\n\nThe most consequential open questions are not about whether “entanglement matters,” but about *what exactly counts as “geometry” operationally* and *which entanglement structures uniquely determine it*. First, there is no single agreed operational definition of geometry in simulators: are we reconstructing (i) connectivity graphs from mutual information, (ii) effective distances from correlator decay, (iii) curvature proxies from entanglement-entropy scaling, or (iv) full emergent metrics consistent with RT/QECC-style reconstructions? Each choice yields different failure modes and different sensitivity to finite-N and finite-depth circuits. Second, the mapping from entanglement measures to emergent metrics remains underconstrained: tensor-network reconstructions are powerful, but they are best-controlled in low-entanglement/area-law regimes, whereas “clean” semiclassical holographic geometries typically presume special large-N structures and characteristic entanglement spectra that may not be faithfully reproduced in near-term devices. Third, robustness to decoherence is not a side issue but a gating constraint: because decoherence is effectively a *spectral-overlap and information-leakage problem*, any entanglement→geometry inference pipeline must incorporate noise spectroscopy, filter-function reasoning, and uncertainty quantification—otherwise “emergent curvature changes” may simply be environment-induced correlation reshaping. Finally, the turbulence/worldsheet branch remains the least grounded: it raises an intriguing “cascade as RG/operator-mixing” analogy, but currently lacks a controlled bridge across scales (from macroscopic turbulence to microscopic stringy degrees of freedom) and lacks discriminating observables that would separate it from generic nonequilibrium entanglement growth in many-body systems.\n\n**Executive-ready recap of progress.** The program has clarified a shared direction—*make emergence operational*—and has identified concrete observables that can anchor comparisons across theory, numerics, and experiments (entanglement entropy/spectra, mutual information patterns, quench-induced entanglement growth, scrambling/OTOC-style probes, and correlation-based Hawking signatures in analogues). It has also surfaced the primary bottlenecks: (1) ambiguity in what “geometry” means in laboratory reconstructions, (2) regime mismatch between classical-geometry limits (large-N/controlled holography) and accessible platforms (finite size, decohering qubits/atoms), and (3) insufficiently specific, falsifiable predictions in the turbulence/worldsheet hypothesis. The decision-relevant takeaway is that near-term progress is most likely when the project treats stringy emergence as a conceptual anchor, while prioritizing **universal, device-testable entanglement→geometry benchmarks** and using established analogue systems (BEC horizons) and coarse-graining frameworks (spin-foam/LQG-style renormalization logic) as robustness/consistency touchstones.\n\n**Decision-focused shortlist: promising next steps (prioritized).** (1) **Standardize operational geometry targets**: adopt a small menu of reconstructable objects (connectivity graph, effective distance, curvature proxy, and a minimal “metric consistency” check) and require every model/simulator result to report them with uncertainties. (2) **Define discriminating diagnostics** computable in both holographic toy models and simulators—e.g., entanglement spectrum fingerprints, mutual-information decay laws, quench growth exponents, and OTOC/scrambling rates—to separate “generic entanglement” from “holography-like entanglement.” (3) **Build a robustness layer against decoherence**: pair each reconstruction with noise spectroscopy and filter-function-aware error bars; treat decoherence as an explicit nuisance model to be fit and subtracted rather than a qualitative caveat. (4) **Cross-validate with controlled numerics**: compute the same diagnostics in known holographic models and in lattice/DMRG/tensor-network approximations to identify which features survive finite-N and finite-depth constraints. (5) **Advance the turbulence/worldsheet idea only via toy-model commitments**: start with solvable/tractable 2D QFT deformations where “cascade-like” scale transfer can be made precise as operator mixing/RG flow and tied to measurable entanglement signatures; defer broad empirical claims until such benchmarks exist. (6) **Exploit mature analogue platforms as reality checks**: use BEC analogue-horizon correlation measurements (including nonstationary formation and backreaction studies) to pressure-test how reliably entanglement/correlation signatures can be turned into geometric inferences under real systematics.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Quantitative/operational mapping from entanglement structure to geometry beyond idealized AdS/CFT — We lack concrete, generally applicable prescriptions that (a) map experimentally accessible entanglement measures (e.g., Rényi entropies, mutual information, entanglement spectrum) onto geometric quantities (distances, curvature, connectivity) in non-AdS, finite-temperature, time-dependent, and mixed-state settings; (b) specify which measures are necessary and sufficient for reconstructing coarse- vs. fine-grained geometric features; and (c) provide error bounds and stability estimates for reconstruction under realistic noise and finite-sampling.\n- Gap 2: Scalable, high-fidelity experimental testbeds and measurement protocols to probe entanglement→geometry hypotheses — There is insufficient development of end-to-end experimental strategies that (a) scale beyond small numbers of qubits/atoms while making the required multipartite entanglement observables practical (including partial tomography, randomized measurements, and entanglement witnesses tailored to geometry); (b) quantify how control errors, decoherence, and finite-temperature effects bias inferred geometric properties; and (c) enable controlled dynamical (quenches, slow ramps) tests of emergent spacetime predictions.\n- Gap 3: Unified theoretical framework incorporating mixed-state entanglement, decoherence, complexity, and gravity-relevant dynamics — Open questions remain about: (a) the role of mixedness/thermalization and conserved quantities in the entanglement→geometry correspondence; (b) how computational/quantum circuit complexity and information scrambling quantitatively relate to geometric notions such as volume, wormholes, or causal structure; and (c) how to integrate resource-theoretic viewpoints (which resources enable geometric emergence) with semiclassical gravity, including concrete criteria for when backreaction and classical geometry approximations hold.\n\n","nodeId":109,"timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:29:38.999Z"},{"type":"synthesis_report","content":"# SYNTHESIS REPORT\n\n**Mission:** Consolidate and synthesize recent cognitive work, research findings, and insights into a comprehensive knowledge report.

If spacetime geometry is a macroscopic statistic of entanglement, then “dynamics of geometry” should track “dynamics of entanglement,” including scrambling and thermalization. This motivates probing whether quantitative fingerprints of instability—e.g., Lyapunov spectra in classical chaotic systems and their quantum analogs in out-of-time-order correlators—can be mapped onto entanglement growth rates and thus onto effective curvature or geometric response in emergent descriptions. At the same time, consolidated findings caution against overextending classical chaos as a generator of genuinely quantum structure: classical deterministic chaos cannot reproduce entanglement or Hilbert-space interference, and when classical chaotic degrees couple to quantum systems, decoherence and measurement back-action tend to bound or suppress the persistence of classical exponential sensitivity in regimes where quantum correlations dominate. The conceptual upshot is sharp: geometry-from-entanglement programs require intrinsically quantum resources (entanglement, error correction, unitary interference), while classical chaos may at best modulate how quickly those quantum resources are generated or redistributed—suggesting a constrained but potentially observable bridge between instability, scrambling, and emergent gravitational behavior.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## FROM THEORY TO TESTBED: QUANTUM SIMULATION AND MEASUREMENT STRATEGIES\n\n### From Theory to Testbed: Quantum Simulation and Measurement Strategies\n\nA concrete experimental program for entanglement–geometry correspondences begins by treating “geometry” not as a background arena but as an inferred structure reconstructed from patterns of quantum correlations.

The guiding strategy is to build a “boundary” system whose entanglement structure can be systematically dialed from area-law-like to volume-law-like regimes (and through intermediate, scale-dependent structures), then compare inferred bulk features—such as the appearance of bottlenecks (minimal cuts), changes in effective curvature, or the breakdown of semiclassical behavior—against the expectations laid out in the report’s earlier theoretical sections.\n\nOn the engineering side, the most direct route is a **tunable tensor-network quantum simulator**: implement a family of circuits/states whose entanglement patterns are known by construction (e.g., MERA-like or random-circuit tensor networks with adjustable bond dimensions and layer connectivity). Superconducting qubits naturally support this approach: one can compile networks into depth-layered gates, vary **effective bond dimension** via ancilla-assisted entanglement, and modify the **coupling graph** (nearest-neighbor vs. long-range links) to emulate different “bulk” connectivities. Cold-atom platforms offer complementary control: Rydberg dressing and cavity-mediated interactions can introduce nonlocal couplings; programmable tweezer geometries can sculpt interaction graphs; and Floquet engineering can interpolate between integrable and chaotic regimes, which theory associates with distinct entanglement growth and, by holographic intuition, distinct geometric phases (more “classical” vs. more “highly quantum” emergent spacetimes). Across both platforms, deliberately introducing **noise and decoherence** is not merely a nuisance but a knob: varying dephasing or loss tests how robust a purported geometry is to imperfections, and whether the transition from semiclassical to “stringy/quantum” geometry tracks specific entanglement thresholds or scrambling rates predicted by the mapping.\n\nMeasurement strategy is the linchpin: the testbed must output quantities that operationalize “geometry.” Since full entanglement entropy is expensive, experiments can rely on **entropy proxies** and correlator-based reconstructions. For cold atoms, randomized measurements and interference protocols enable estimates of **Rényi entropies** for subsystems; for superconducting qubits, randomized compiling and classical shadows can efficiently estimate many subsystem observables. Key observables include: (1) **mutual information** \\(I(A:B)\\) across varying region sizes and separations, used as a distance-like indicator (higher mutual information implying shorter effective separation in many reconstruction schemes); (2) **connected correlators** and their spatial decay, which can be compared to geodesic-distance heuristics in emergent geometry pictures; (3) **entanglement spectrum** features (not just total entropy), since tensor-network/holographic models often constrain spectral structure more tightly than scalar entropies; and (4) **operator reconstruction fidelity**, implemented by attempting entanglement-wedge-like recovery: encode a logical operator into a larger system, erase or scramble a boundary region, and quantify how well the operator can be reconstructed from the complement. This last observable directly targets the “bulk-from-boundary” idea and provides an experimentally falsifiable link between entanglement structure and reconstructable interior degrees of freedom.\n\nInterpreting outcomes connects the lab observables back to the theoretical claims: if a specific holographic/tensor-network mapping is correct, then controlled deformations of the boundary entanglement graph (changing bond dimensions, adding/removing long-range couplings, tuning noise/scrambling) should produce **predictable, quantitative shifts** in inferred bulk structure—e.g., systematic movement of minimal-cut surfaces inferred from entropy proxies, consistent changes in effective curvature extracted from mutual-information geometry, and corresponding changes in reconstruction thresholds. Conversely, persistent mismatches—such as mutual-information-inferred distances failing to track minimal-cut predictions, or reconstruction fidelity not correlating with the entanglement patterns that the model deems “geometric”—provide a clear falsification channel and identify which assumptions in the entanglement→geometry dictionary need revision. The overarching deliverable is thus not a single demonstration but a calibrated *response function*: how emergent geometric indicators vary with experimentally tunable entanglement resources and noise. This turns the entanglement–geometry conjecture from an interpretive framework into an engineering discipline, with explicit knobs, benchmarks, and failure modes that can discriminate between semiclassical holographic behavior and regimes where “geometry” ceases to be a useful effective description.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CROSS-CUTTING INSIGHTS, OPEN QUESTIONS, AND NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n\n## Cross-Cutting Insights, Open Questions, and Next Research Directions\n\nAcross the report’s strands—string/brane emergence, turbulence/worldsheet speculation, and quantum-simulator/tensor-network routes—a stable common core has emerged: *geometry is being treated as a derived, operational construct extracted from patterns of quantum correlations*, with holography serving as the organizing metaphor and entanglement/mutual information as the primary diagnostics. This convergence is strengthened by parallel developments in other approaches: spin-foam/LQG has increasingly reframed progress in terms of **coarse-graining/renormalization toward continuum recovery and effective diffeomorphism symmetry**, echoing the same “geometry-from-structured-information + RG flow” logic even when the microscopic degrees of freedom differ. In the most experimentally mature analogue-gravity track (BEC analogue horizons), the emphasis has likewise shifted toward **correlation-based signatures** (Hawking-like particle–partner correlations, indications of entanglement) and then toward **robustness questions** (nonstationary horizon formation, backreaction, systematics). Taken together, the cross-cutting insight is that the field is moving from evocative emergence narratives to a more testable program: specify a mapping from quantum observables → candidate geometric data, then stress-test that mapping under realistic noise, finite-size, and nonideal dynamics.\n\nThe most consequential open questions are not about whether “entanglement matters,” but about *what exactly counts as “geometry” operationally* and *which entanglement structures uniquely determine it*. First, there is no single agreed operational definition of geometry in simulators: are we reconstructing (i) connectivity graphs from mutual information, (ii) effective distances from correlator decay, (iii) curvature proxies from entanglement-entropy scaling, or (iv) full emergent metrics consistent with RT/QECC-style reconstructions? Each choice yields different failure modes and different sensitivity to finite-N and finite-depth circuits. Second, the mapping from entanglement measures to emergent metrics remains underconstrained: tensor-network reconstructions are powerful, but they are best-controlled in low-entanglement/area-law regimes, whereas “clean” semiclassical holographic geometries typically presume special large-N structures and characteristic entanglement spectra that may not be faithfully reproduced in near-term devices. Third, robustness to decoherence is not a side issue but a gating constraint: because decoherence is effectively a *spectral-overlap and information-leakage problem*, any entanglement→geometry inference pipeline must incorporate noise spectroscopy, filter-function reasoning, and uncertainty quantification—otherwise “emergent curvature changes” may simply be environment-induced correlation reshaping. Finally, the turbulence/worldsheet branch remains the least grounded: it raises an intriguing “cascade as RG/operator-mixing” analogy, but currently lacks a controlled bridge across scales (from macroscopic turbulence to microscopic stringy degrees of freedom) and lacks discriminating observables that would separate it from generic nonequilibrium entanglement growth in many-body systems.\n\n**Executive-ready recap of progress.** The program has clarified a shared direction—*make emergence operational*—and has identified concrete observables that can anchor comparisons across theory, numerics, and experiments (entanglement entropy/spectra, mutual information patterns, quench-induced entanglement growth, scrambling/OTOC-style probes, and correlation-based Hawking signatures in analogues). It has also surfaced the primary bottlenecks: (1) ambiguity in what “geometry” means in laboratory reconstructions, (2) regime mismatch between classical-geometry limits (large-N/controlled holography) and accessible platforms (finite size, decohering qubits/atoms), and (3) insufficiently specific, falsifiable predictions in the turbulence/worldsheet hypothesis. The decision-relevant takeaway is that near-term progress is most likely when the project treats stringy emergence as a conceptual anchor, while prioritizing **universal, device-testable entanglement→geometry benchmarks** and using established analogue systems (BEC horizons) and coarse-graining frameworks (spin-foam/LQG-style renormalization logic) as robustness/consistency touchstones.\n\n**Decision-focused shortlist: promising next steps (prioritized).** (1) **Standardize operational geometry targets**: adopt a small menu of reconstructable objects (connectivity graph, effective distance, curvature proxy, and a minimal “metric consistency” check) and require every model/simulator result to report them with uncertainties. (2) **Define discriminating diagnostics** computable in both holographic toy models and simulators—e.g., entanglement spectrum fingerprints, mutual-information decay laws, quench growth exponents, and OTOC/scrambling rates—to separate “generic entanglement” from “holography-like entanglement.” (3) **Build a robustness layer against decoherence**: pair each reconstruction with noise spectroscopy and filter-function-aware error bars; treat decoherence as an explicit nuisance model to be fit and subtracted rather than a qualitative caveat. (4) **Cross-validate with controlled numerics**: compute the same diagnostics in known holographic models and in lattice/DMRG/tensor-network approximations to identify which features survive finite-N and finite-depth constraints. (5) **Advance the turbulence/worldsheet idea only via toy-model commitments**: start with solvable/tractable 2D QFT deformations where “cascade-like” scale transfer can be made precise as operator mixing/RG flow and tied to measurable entanglement signatures; defer broad empirical claims until such benchmarks exist. (6) **Exploit mature analogue platforms as reality checks**: use BEC analogue-horizon correlation measurements (including nonstationary formation and backreaction studies) to pressure-test how reliably entanglement/correlation signatures can be turned into geometric inferences under real systematics.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Quantitative/operational mapping from entanglement structure to geometry beyond idealized AdS/CFT — We lack concrete, generally applicable prescriptions that (a) map experimentally accessible entanglement measures (e.g., Rényi entropies, mutual information, entanglement spectrum) onto geometric quantities (distances, curvature, connectivity) in non-AdS, finite-temperature, time-dependent, and mixed-state settings; (b) specify which measures are necessary and sufficient for reconstructing coarse- vs. fine-grained geometric features; and (c) provide error bounds and stability estimates for reconstruction under realistic noise and finite-sampling.\n- Gap 2: Scalable, high-fidelity experimental testbeds and measurement protocols to probe entanglement→geometry hypotheses — There is insufficient development of end-to-end experimental strategies that (a) scale beyond small numbers of qubits/atoms while making the required multipartite entanglement observables practical (including partial tomography, randomized measurements, and entanglement witnesses tailored to geometry); (b) quantify how control errors, decoherence, and finite-temperature effects bias inferred geometric properties; and (c) enable controlled dynamical (quenches, slow ramps) tests of emergent spacetime predictions.\n- Gap 3: Unified theoretical framework incorporating mixed-state entanglement, decoherence, complexity, and gravity-relevant dynamics — Open questions remain about: (a) the role of mixedness/thermalization and conserved quantities in the entanglement→geometry correspondence; (b) how computational/quantum circuit complexity and information scrambling quantitatively relate to geometric notions such as volume, wormholes, or causal structure; and (c) how to integrate resource-theoretic viewpoints (which resources enable geometric emergence) with semiclassical gravity, including concrete criteria for when backreaction and classical geometry approximations hold.\n\n","executiveSummary":"Recent synthesis reframes quantum entanglement not as a mysterious superluminal “influence,” but as a property of a single, nonseparable shared quantum state—an information resource whose observable signatures are correlation constraints rather than signals. Building on holography and tensor-network ideas, the work converges on a unifying picture: spacetime geometry can be treated as an emergent, coarse-grained summary of underlying quantum information structure, with distance, connectivity, and even curvature reflecting patterns of entanglement. In this framing, “geometry” is operational and reconstructible: it is inferred from how subsystems share and distribute quantum information, not assumed as a fixed background.\n\nThe report’s key value is a concrete path from theory to testbed. It outlines an experimental program in which quantum simulators and measurement protocols reconstruct effective geometry from measurable correlations (e.g., entanglement structure, mutual information, and network reconstructions), enabling falsifiable checks of entanglement–geometry correspondences. Cross-cutting insights emphasize a stable core—geometry as a derived construct—and highlight open questions: which entanglement measures map most directly to geometric features, what dynamics preserve or destroy emergent locality, and what minimal experimental signatures would distinguish competing emergence mechanisms.","sectionsGenerated":8,"sourcesConsulted":30,"knowledgeGaps":["Gap 1: Quantitative/operational mapping from entanglement structure to geometry beyond idealized AdS/CFT — We lack concrete, generally applicable prescriptions that (a) map experimentally accessible entanglement measures (e.g., Rényi entropies, mutual information, entanglement spectrum) onto geometric quantities (distances, curvature, connectivity) in non-AdS, finite-temperature, time-dependent, and mixed-state settings; (b) specify which measures are necessary and sufficient for reconstructing coarse- vs. fine-grained geometric features; and (c) provide error bounds and stability estimates for reconstruction under realistic noise and finite-sampling.","Gap 2: Scalable, high-fidelity experimental testbeds and measurement protocols to probe entanglement→geometry hypotheses — There is insufficient development of end-to-end experimental strategies that (a) scale beyond small numbers of qubits/atoms while making the required multipartite entanglement observables practical (including partial tomography, randomized measurements, and entanglement witnesses tailored to geometry); (b) quantify how control errors, decoherence, and finite-temperature effects bias inferred geometric properties; and (c) enable controlled dynamical (quenches, slow ramps) tests of emergent spacetime predictions.","Gap 3: Unified theoretical framework incorporating mixed-state entanglement, decoherence, complexity, and gravity-relevant dynamics — Open questions remain about: (a) the role of mixedness/thermalization and conserved quantities in the entanglement→geometry correspondence; (b) how computational/quantum circuit complexity and information scrambling quantitatively relate to geometric notions such as volume, wormholes, or causal structure; and (c) how to integrate resource-theoretic viewpoints (which resources enable geometric emergence) with semiclassical gravity, including concrete criteria for when backreaction and classical geometry approximations hold."],"timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:29:38.999Z"},3],"progressReports":[{"percent":10,"message":"Gathering relevant knowledge","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:27:15.740Z"},{"percent":30,"message":"Gathered 30 memory nodes","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:27:16.571Z"},{"percent":45,"message":"Synthesis structure created","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:27:27.103Z"},{"percent":53.75,"message":"Generated section: Reframing Quantum Entanglement: From “Nonlocal Influence” to Shared Information Resource","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:27:50.675Z"},{"percent":62.5,"message":"Generated section: Entanglement as the Seed of Geometry: Holography and Emergent Spacetime","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:28:14.402Z"},{"percent":71.25,"message":"Generated section: From Theory to Testbed: Quantum Simulation and Measurement Strategies","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:28:44.703Z"},{"percent":80,"message":"Generated section: Cross-Cutting Insights, Open Questions, and Next Research Directions","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:29:18.525Z"},{"percent":85,"message":"Creating executive summary","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:29:18.525Z"},{"percent":92,"message":"Identifying knowledge gaps","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:29:30.572Z"},{"percent":97,"message":"Adding synthesis to memory","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:29:38.259Z"},{"percent":100,"message":"Synthesis complete","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:29:38.999Z"}],"errors":[],"handoffSpec":null,"agentSpecificData":{"success":true,"sectionsGenerated":8,"sourcesConsulted":30,"reportLength":26009,"metadata":{"reportGenerated":true,"wordCount":3210,"sectionsGenerated":8,"sourcesConsulted":30,"status":"complete"}},"metadata":{"reportGenerated":true,"wordCount":3210,"sectionsGenerated":8,"sourcesConsulted":30,"status":"complete"},"queuedAt":"2025-12-22T19:29:39.003Z","processed":false,"integrated":false}

Below are agreement points, explicit conflicts, and concise recommended next actions.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All three treat classical intuitions (simple local realism; exact smooth manifold; exact Lorentz invariance) as potentially emergent or approximate rather than fundamental.\n- Nontrivial quantum structure (entanglement, nonlocal correlations) plays a central role in any deeper account of reality. Branches 1 and 2 both put entanglement/quantum structure at the explanatory core.\n- Empirical contact is possible and necessary: Branch 1 motivates Bell-type and related foundational tests; Branch 3 motivates high-energy astrophysical time-of-flight tests; Branch 2 motivates looking for quantum-gravity signatures (and for consistency constraints linking microscopic models to low-energy geometry).\n- Conservatism about immediate overthrow: none of the branches claim current classical physics is useless; they aim to identify where and how it must be extended.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Determinism vs. relativistic structure:\n  - Branch 1 (deterministic hidden variables) typically requires nonlocal structure and, in relativistic extensions, often a preferred foliation or frame (e.g., most Bohmian proposals). That sits uneasily with exact Lorentz invariance/diffeomorphism symmetry expected in relativistic spacetime.\n- Continuity vs. discreteness and Lorentz invariance:\n  - Branch 2 advocates emergent continuity from discrete quantum connectivity; Branch 3 assumes discreteness at Planck scale that can produce energy-dependent propagation delays (violating exact Lorentz invariance). These are not logically incompatible, but there is a tension: not all discrete/emergent models imply observable Lorentz breaking.

Key tensions arise where claims about locality, universality, and experimental feasibility push in different directions.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Entanglement and operator dynamics are fundamental objects of study. Each branch treats entanglement growth, operator spreading (e.g., OTOCs), or entanglement structure as the natural language to address hard problems (emergent geometry, quantum turbulence analogues, or gravitational coupling to superpositions).\n- A dynamical, quantitative mapping (not merely heuristic) is required. All branches demand precise, testable relations: Branch 1 needs a dynamical mapping to reproduce semiclassical gravity and QFT; Branch 2 seeks a precise statistical map between classical cascade and quantum operator/entanglement cascades; Branch 3 needs quantitative estimates of gravitational signals from mesoscopic superpositions.\n- Cross-fertilization between theory and experiment is essential. Branches 2 and 3 explicitly call for cold-atom / superconducting-qubit and mesoscopic-mass experiments; Branch 1 benefits from experimental probes that constrain candidate mappings (e.g., entanglement measures, causal structure).\n- Universal/statistical character will be important. Branch 2’s search for universality in spectra/OTOCs is consistent with Branch 1’s need for low-energy, coarse-grained limits that reproduce semiclassical equations independent of microscopic details.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Locality and emergent locality: Branch 1’s hypothesis that entanglement patterns (rather than local degrees of freedom) constitute spacetime can conflict with Branch 3’s implicit assumption that gravity couples locally to mass distributions (so that a nearby probe measures a distinct classical field from a superposed mass). If spacetime and the graviton are emergent from nonlocal entanglement, the notion of a well-defined local gravitational field for a spatially superposed mass may need reinterpretation; predictions for the probe’s response could differ substantially between “gravity is a local field” and “gravity is emergent/nonlocal.” That is, Branch 1 could imply novel nonlocal backreaction or effective decoherence mechanisms that change expected signals in Branch 3.\n- Microscopic vs statistical descriptions: Branch 1 demands a precise dynamical mapping that reproduces both semiclassical Einstein equations and local QFT in all low-energy limits — a strong requirement that can be in tension with Branch 2’s search for universal, statistical mappings (Kolmogorov-like) that may be inherently approximate or effective. Reconciling a fully dynamical one-to-one mapping with a coarse-grained statistical universality is nontrivial.\n- Scale and feasibility: Branch 2 and 3 posit near-term experimental tests (cold atoms/qubits for entanglement cascades; mesoscopic resonator experiments to probe gravitational coupling). Branch 1 points to a much more sweeping theoretical program (deriving semiclassical gravity), which may require models (e.g., tensor networks, SYK, holography) whose connection to realistic, table-top systems is indirect. Thus there is tension about realistic timelines and which experiments can meaningfully constrain the fundamental question of emergent spacetime.\n- What counts as “reproducing semiclassical gravity”: Branch 1’s goal to reproduce semiclassical Einstein equations including causal structure and backreaction is a high bar; Branch 3’s experiment might be interpreted as a test of whether gravity couples linearly to quantum expectation values (semiclassical coupling) versus some alternative (e.g., collapse models or fundamentally classical gravity). But different emergent-gravity scenarios can give the same low-energy semiclassical predictions while differing in higher-order or nonperturbative effects, so a single mesoscopic experiment may not decisively discriminate among theories without a clear mapping from microscopic entanglement structure to experimental observables.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, prioritized)\nA. Immediate theoretical program (0–2 years)\n   - Develop and compare minimal toy models that link entanglement/operator dynamics to emergent effective geometry and to measurable quantities:\n     * Tensor-network and cMERA constructions with time dependence; compute entanglement spectra, modular Hamiltonians, causal cones.\n     * Chaotic many-body models (SYK variants, random circuits) that permit analytic/numeric control of OTOCs and entanglement growth, and probe when hydrodynamic/semiclassical gravitational descriptions emerge.\n   - Derive explicit predictions for observable quantities in condensed-matter platforms (entanglement spectrum scalings, OTOC scaling exponents, operator front shapes), emphasizing quantities that can distinguish between competing emergent-gravity scenarios (local semiclassical coupling vs nonlocal/emergent coupling).\n   - For gravitational-coupling questions, map how different emergent-gravity hypotheses modify the expected gravitational signal from a mesoscopic superposition (e.g., linear coupling to mass expectation ⟨Tμν⟩, stochastic gravitational field, induced decoherence, or nonlocal correlations). Produce compact, testable parameter-space plots (mass vs separation vs coherence time vs detector sensitivity) for each scenario.\n\nB. Experimental program (2–5 years)\n   - Branch 2 experiments: Scale up cold-atom / superconducting-qubit platforms to measure entanglement spectra and OTOCs in regimes that mimic classical turbulence (many modes, driven-dissipative, scale separation). Target observables:\n     * Scaling exponents of entanglement spectra across scales and times.\n     * Universal collapse of OTOC growth/velocity and its relation to spectral cascades.\n     * Controlled disorder/interaction strength scans to probe universality classes.\n   - Branch 3 proofs-of-principle: Focus on near-term achievable regimes:\n     * Specify minimal target: masses 10^-15–10^-12 kg, separations ~100 nm–µm, coherence times ≥ ms–s, force/phase sensitivity at or below gravitational interaction scale. Produce refined feasibility and noise budgets (seismic, stray forces, Casimir, thermal) and roadmap for required improvement in force/acceleration sensing (optomechanics, SQUIDs, atomic interferometry).\n     * Perform intermediary experiments measuring classical gravitational coupling of micro-objects with quantum control (coherent positioning, motional ground state preparation) to validate techniques.\n   - Cross-check: Use many-body quantum simulators to emulate aspects of mesoscopic center-of-mass superpositions coupled to simplified gravitational-channel models to test signatures predicted by theory.\n\nC. Integration milestones (5 years)\n   - Demonstrate one or more universal scaling relations linking entanglement spectra/OTOCs to classical cascade analogues (or show clear counter-evidence).\n   - Produce toy-model derivation where coarse-grained entanglement dynamics yields semiclassical gravitational equations in a controlled limit; identify which experimental observables would falsify or support that derivation.\n   - Achieve an experimental upper bound or detection threshold for gravitational effects of a quantum superposition that meaningfully constrains semiclassical vs alternative coupling models.\n\nPractical immediate actions for teams/policy:\n- Fund small, focused theory–experiment collaborations that (i) compute experimental signatures of different emergent-gravity mechanisms and (ii) implement entanglement/OTOC measurements in scalable platforms.\n- Prioritize development of protocol standards: standardized OTOC/entanglement-spectrum measurement procedures and a standard gravitational-superposition sensitivity metric so different groups’ results can be directly compared.\n- Maintain a transparent repository of model predictions vs experimental sensitivities to guide where incremental technological advances lead to greatest discrimination power.\n\nBottom line: The branches form a coherent research agenda: build controlled theoretical toy models linking entanglement/operator dynamics to emergent low-energy gravity and hydrodynamic universality; design and run quantum-simulator experiments to probe entanglement cascades and operator growth; parallelly pursue staged mesoscopic-gravity experiments with clear theoretical mappings of what a positive/negative result implies for emergent-spacetime hypotheses.

On this view, Bell-type correlations are explained by the **structure of joint information and measurement context**, while the practical fragility of entanglement is understood through **uncontrolled information leakage** (decoherence) that converts usable nonclassical correlations into effectively classical uncertainty. This framing is valuable because it replaces metaphysical puzzles with operational quantities—who can access which correlations, under what noise models, and what tasks (communication, sensing, computation) the shared resource enables.\n\nA second major theme links this resource-theoretic stance to **geometry-from-entanglement** programs in holography and tensor-network models: spacetime geometry appears as an *effective* description of entanglement structure and its organization across degrees of freedom, shifting emphasis from “what spacetime is” to **what geometric relationships can be inferred from accessible quantum information**. The cross-cutting insight is that both foundations and quantum-gravity directions benefit from the same playbook—track information flow, quantify degradation, and test reconstruction schemes—while key gaps remain around **which entanglement measures map robustly to geometric features**, how leakage/noise modifies emergent geometry, and what **testable, non-holography-specific signatures** could discriminate competing reconstruction proposals.\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & CURRENT STATE OF PLAY\n\n## Executive Summary & Current State of Play\n\nAcross the recent cycles, the work has converged on a single organizing perspective: **entanglement is best treated as a shared information resource whose structure—and whose degradation through uncontrolled information leakage—does real explanatory work**. In this framing, entanglement is not a superluminal influence but a constraint on joint statistics arising from a nonseparable global quantum state; the operational emphasis shifts from “spooky action” to **resource management** (how correlations are created, routed, protected, and consumed). This has also clarified how classicality enters: **decoherence is the mechanism by which correlation becomes effectively classical record**, and it is increasingly modeled in actionable terms as an *information-flow/spectral-overlap* problem (coherence decays efficiently only into environmental modes that couple at the right frequencies). The practical takeaway is that the same language—channels, noise spectra, and error correction—connects foundational questions to engineering levers (filters, bandgaps, Purcell suppression, and recovery protocols) that directly control how long entanglement remains usable.\n\nA second strong point of convergence is the **entanglement→geometry thesis**: classical spacetime/geometry is being treated as an emergent, coarse-grained descriptor of deeper correlation structure rather than a fundamental background. Holography and tensor-network paradigms remain the main “laboratory of ideas,” with Ryu–Takayanagi–type relations, mutual information, entanglement spectra, and operator reconstruction (QECC viewpoint) serving as the working dictionary between quantum data and bulk connectivity/curvature. What has changed since prior syntheses is a sharper emphasis on **operational reconstruction and falsifiability**: rather than treating emergence as interpretive, the program increasingly asks for *response functions*—predictable shifts in inferred bulk structure under controlled deformations of boundary entanglement (quenches, changing coupling graphs, tuning scrambling, injecting calibrated noise). This puts weight on measurable diagnostics (e.g., mutual-information “distance” patterns, entanglement-spectrum fingerprints, and reconstruction fidelity thresholds) and on explicitly benchmarking when tensor-network reconstructions are trustworthy given the regime mismatch between near-term devices and large‑N holographic limits.\n\nAt the same time, agent reviews highlight stable tensions that define the current state of play. The branches agree on emergence and on the need for concrete probes, but **diverge on mechanism and regime**: string/brane-centric pictures (conceptual anchor) versus experimentally accessible many-body simulators (pragmatic testbed) versus turbulence/worldsheet ideas (most speculative). The main fault lines are (i) **universality vs specificity**—whether entanglement→geometry mappings are robust across microscopic realizations or require special large‑N/code-like structure; (ii) **background dependence**—AdS/CFT and tensor networks offer controlled settings but do not, by themselves, resolve background independence; and (iii) **diagnostic adequacy**—tensor networks naturally capture area-law structures, while holographic states can exhibit more intricate spectra, so “matching the right entanglement” is nontrivial. The turbulence/worldsheet branch is now best viewed as an *analogy to be modeled inside the entanglement/OTOC/tensor-network toolkit*, not as a literal microscopic claim, until it yields distinct observables (e.g., operator-mixing signatures or scaling exponents) computable in both toy models and data.\n\nThe decision-relevant takeaway is that the program is transitioning from broad emergence narratives to a **test-driven, modular agenda**. Near-term progress is most credible where theory and experiment can meet: (1) build controllable quantum-simulator states with tunable entanglement graphs (cold atoms or superconducting qubits), (2) measure a standardized set of information-theoretic observables (Rényi entropies/proxies, mutual information profiles, entanglement spectra, OTOC/scrambling rates, operator recovery fidelity), and (3) run reconstruction pipelines (tensor-network or ML-assisted) to infer discrete connectivity/curvature with quantified uncertainties and explicit noise models. Success looks like reproducible, quantitative correlations between *engineered entanglement changes* and *inferred geometric changes* consistent with a chosen dictionary; failure is equally valuable, as persistent mismatches would falsify specific entanglement→geometry assumptions and clarify which features are artefacts of finite size, decoherence, or the chosen reconstruction ansatz. In short: **entanglement is increasingly treated as the manipulable “fuel,” decoherence as the controllable loss channel, and emergent spacetime as an operational reconstruction problem with clear benchmarks**—with holography providing the controlled theory lab and quantum simulation providing the near-term empirical traction.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CORE THEMES: ENTANGLEMENT AS A SHARED INFORMATION RESOURCE (NOT A ‘NONLOCAL INFLUENCE’)\n\nEntanglement is most productively framed not as a superluminal “influence” propagating between distant systems, but as a property of a *single, nonseparable quantum state* jointly describing them. The striking correlations observed in Bell-type experiments arise because measurement outcomes are sampled from this shared state, not because one outcome physically reaches across space to “cause” the other. This reframing clarifies two persistent confusions at once: (i) why entanglement can violate classical intuitions about separability without enabling controllable faster‑than‑light signaling, and (ii) why the operational content of entanglement is best understood in information-theoretic terms—what correlations are available, under what measurements, and how they can be transformed under allowed operations. In this view, entanglement is a resource akin to energy or computational workspace: it can be *created* (e.g., via interaction and joint unitary dynamics), *stored* (with difficulty), *consumed* (e.g., in teleportation or entanglement swapping), and *depleted* by uncontrolled couplings.\n\nDecoherence then becomes the central mechanism determining when and how this resource remains usable. Entanglement is rapidly degraded when environmental degrees of freedom become correlated with the system, effectively “leaking” which‑path or phase information into inaccessible channels and yielding classical-appearing outcomes under coarse graining. Importantly, this is not an unavoidable metaphysical collapse but an open‑system information flow problem: the shared quantum state becomes distributed across system+environment, and the subsystem accessible to the experimenter transitions from pure to mixed. This is why preserving entanglement in practice reduces to engineering isolation, monitoring noise pathways, and applying quantum error correction—methods that constrain where information can flow and how correlations spread. The guiding intuition is simple: the more the environment learns (even in principle) about the system, the less entanglement remains available *between* the degrees of freedom we want to treat as a coherent pair or many-body register.\n\nA concrete, actionable refinement of this picture is that decoherence is often a *spectral mismatch* problem rather than a generic fate: a qubit loses coherence efficiently only to environmental modes with spectral weight overlapping its transition frequencies and coupling spectrum. This turns “protecting entanglement” into targeted control of the environment’s spectral density—using Purcell-filtered resonators, bandstop filtering, tailored impedance environments, or engineered phononic bandgaps to suppress noise at the relevant frequencies. Such techniques do not “block nonlocality”; they prevent unwanted correlations from forming with uncontrolled modes. In laboratory terms, entanglement lifetime is extended not by philosophical reinterpretation but by hardware that shapes coupling channels, plus control protocols (dynamical decoupling, stabilized operations, and error-correcting codes) that actively repair the resource as it is consumed and perturbed.\n\nThis resource-centric framing also aligns with broader interpretive and theoretical programs that treat classicality—and possibly even effective spacetime structure—as emergent from coarse‑grained entanglement dynamics. On this view, the productive path is to model the system as a network of quantum channels: specify what is traced out, what is monitored, and what constraints (causality/no‑signaling, consistency, locality of interactions) govern the resulting effective descriptions. It also motivates sharper bridges between classical and quantum complexity: classical chaos, characterized by Lyapunov spectra, may map onto quantum information scrambling rates (e.g., via out‑of‑time‑order correlators), suggesting that regions of higher instability correspond to faster entanglement growth and, in emergent-geometry pictures, potentially stronger effective curvature. Whether or not any specific entanglement→geometry map is ultimately correct, the unifying theme is that the “spooky” features are most fruitfully treated as dynamics of shared information—created, redistributed, and lost through identifiable channels that can be modeled, engineered, and experimentally stress-tested.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## GEOMETRY FROM ENTANGLEMENT: HOLOGRAPHY, EMERGENT SPACETIME, AND TESTABLE PROPOSALS\n\n### Geometry From Entanglement: Holography, Emergent Spacetime, and Testable Proposals\n\nA convergent theme across holography, tensor-network models, and quantum information is that spacetime geometry is not a fundamental input but an effective description of how quantum degrees of freedom are entangled. In AdS/CFT and related “holographic principle” frameworks, the bulk gravitational geometry is encoded in boundary entanglement structure: coarse geometric quantities (areas, distances, causal wedges) track information-theoretic ones (entanglement entropy, mutual information, operator recoverability). Tensor networks make this relationship explicit by turning patterns of entanglement into a discrete geometry: the network’s connectivity and bond dimensions simultaneously specify (i) a many-body quantum state and (ii) an emergent graph-like “bulk” whose minimal cuts reproduce entanglement entropies in the spirit of Ryu–Takayanagi. This viewpoint suggests a practical unification: rather than debating emergent geometry as a purely formal correspondence, we can treat entanglement patterns as tunable control knobs and ask which patterns robustly yield a classical, smooth emergent spacetime versus a highly quantum, non-geometric regime.\n\nThe cross-agent agreement emphasizes shifting from abstract dualities to *controllable quantum simulators* where the entanglement graph can be engineered and varied. Cold-atom platforms (e.g., optical lattices with programmable interactions) and superconducting qubit arrays (with tunable couplers and native entangling gates) are particularly well-suited because they allow systematic control over connectivity, interaction range, and circuit depth—precisely the levers that determine entanglement structure. A central proposal is to implement a tunable tensor-network-like state preparation (or variational circuit family) in which changing coupler geometry, gate layout, or interaction graph corresponds to changing an effective bulk geometry. One then measures entanglement diagnostics—Rényi entropies, entanglement spectra, mutual information between disjoint regions, and multipartite measures—to track how “geometric” features emerge or fail. For example, increasing long-range couplings should boost mutual information at larger boundary separations; in holographic interpretations this corresponds to shortening effective bulk distances or introducing “wormhole-like” shortcuts in the reconstructed geometry. Conversely, reducing connectivity or inducing disorder can drive fragmentation where reconstructed connectivity breaks down, offering a laboratory proxy for transitions between smooth semiclassical bulk and non-geometric phases.\n\nThe key methodological bridge is *reconstruction and falsification*: use measured entanglement data to infer an effective geometry and then test whether it behaves like a gravitational bulk predicted by a specific holographic mapping. Practically, this can proceed in two linked tracks. First, perform tensor-network reconstruction (or related embedding methods) from experimentally accessible entanglement/mutual-information matrices to infer curvature/connectivity; compare the inferred geometry against the geometry implied by the known engineered entanglement graph and by the target holographic model. Second, test *operator reconstruction fidelity*—the ability to recover “bulk” operators from subregions of the “boundary”—as a functional probe of entanglement wedge reconstruction. In a holographic code picture, varying boundary entanglement should shift which boundary regions can reconstruct a given interior operator, producing sharp, measurable changes in recoverability. If the entanglement wedge predictions (based on a chosen model) do not match the experimentally observed reconstruction thresholds or error-correction performance, the corresponding entanglement→geometry assumptions are not merely incomplete—they are empirically wrong for that regime.\n\nThese proposals are attractive because they turn a deep conceptual claim—“geometry comes from entanglement”—into a sequence of falsifiable, parameter-swept experiments. By scanning connectivity, interaction range, and circuit depth, one can map out when emergent geometry becomes approximately classical (area-law–like entanglement with stable minimal-cut behavior and consistent reconstruction) versus when it becomes strongly quantum (highly nonlocal mutual information, unstable reconstructions, and geometry that cannot be consistently embedded). Importantly, the aim is not to “build AdS in the lab” literally, but to calibrate which entanglement structures reproduce the operational signatures associated with holographic bulk physics: consistent entropic inequalities, robust error-correcting structure, and predictable causal/entanglement-wedge behavior under controlled perturbations. The resulting empirical map would both constrain model-building in string-inspired holography and provide a concrete experimental program for emergent spacetime: identify the entanglement patterns that reliably yield geometric behavior, and pinpoint where—and how—those patterns fail.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CROSS-CUTTING CONNECTIONS, OPEN QUESTIONS, AND NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n\n## Cross-Cutting Connections, Open Questions, and Next Research Directions\n\nA unifying bridge across the resource-theoretic view of entanglement and spacetime-emergence programs is the shift from *ontology* (“what spacetime is”) to *operational inference* (“what geometric structure can be reconstructed from accessible quantum information”). In resource theory, entanglement is quantified, interconverted, degraded by noise channels, and consumed to enable tasks; in emergent-geometry approaches, those same capabilities become the proposed “atoms” of geometry: adjacency corresponds to strong shared correlations, minimal surfaces correspond to entanglement bottlenecks, and semiclassical locality corresponds to correctability properties reminiscent of quantum error-correcting codes. This creates a concrete conceptual loop: if geometry is a coarse-grained summary of correlation structure, then the *resource monotones* (entropies, mutual information, entanglement spectrum features, multipartite measures) and the *free operations/noise models* (LOCC, locality constraints, open-system channels) should jointly determine which “geometries” are reachable, stable, and meaningfully reconstructible. Tensor-network and holographic intuitions (RT-like minimal cuts, MERA-like hyperbolic layering, entanglement-wedge reconstruction) thus become not only metaphors but candidate *compilers*: explicit maps from entanglement resources to effective geometric data structures. A practical example of this bridge is to treat operator-reconstruction fidelity as a geometry diagnostic: if a boundary subregion can recover a logical/bulk operator after erasure, the state’s entanglement is functioning like a code with an “interior,” and that interior’s size/connectivity can be tracked as a resource-dependent quantity.\n\nThe dominant open questions cluster around *metrics for “geometry from entanglement”* and the identifiability of geometry given realistic, finite data. There is still no consensus on which operational geometry targets should be standard: (i) a connectivity graph inferred from mutual information thresholds, (ii) effective distances inferred from correlator decay, (iii) curvature proxies inferred from entropy scaling and tripartite-information structure, or (iv) a stricter “metric-consistency” object that must simultaneously fit multiple entanglement and correlator constraints (an RT/QECC-inspired consistency check rather than a single proxy). Each choice is sensitive to different entanglement resources and different failure modes: mutual information can be nonzero in many non-geometric states; tensor networks are most controlled in area-law regimes, while clean semiclassical holographic behavior is often associated with special large‑N structures and characteristic entanglement spectra that may not be reproduced at finite size or circuit depth. A second gap is mixed-state and time-dependent settings: laboratory states are generically noisy and partially thermal, so any entanglement→geometry dictionary must specify which mixed-state measures (e.g., Rényi‑2 via randomized measurements, entanglement spectrum fragments, operational witnesses) are necessary and sufficient to recover coarse geometry, and how reconstructions behave under dynamics such as quenches and scrambling (OTOC-like operator growth). Without these clarifications, “geometry reconstruction” risks becoming underconstrained curve fitting rather than a falsifiable mapping.\n\nRobustness under decoherence is the gating constraint that connects the two domains most sharply: resource theory forces explicit accounting for how entanglement degrades under channels, while emergent-geometry programs often assume near-ideal states. Here, the report’s information-flow framing of decoherence as an *engineering- and spectroscopy-manageable leakage problem* suggests a concrete research layer that should be integrated into every geometry claim. Specifically, reconstruction pipelines should incorporate (a) noise spectroscopy and filter-function reasoning to model which environmental modes are absorbing information, (b) uncertainty quantification that propagates finite sampling and control errors into geometric error bars, and (c) null tests where the same measured entanglement proxies are reproduced by calibrated noise reshaping alone (to rule out “emergent curvature” artifacts caused by environment-induced correlation restructuring). This is also where analogue platforms serve as reality checks: BEC analogue-horizon experiments have already been forced to treat correlation-based signatures and systematics (nonstationary formation, backreaction, finite temperature) as co-equal with the headline effect, and emergent-geometry simulators will need comparable standards. In short, if geometry is inferred from correlations, then “noise that reshapes correlations” is not a secondary nuisance—it is a competing explanation that must be modeled and discriminated against.\n\nThe next research directions should therefore be organized as an end-to-end, benchmark-driven program that couples theory, numerics, and experiment. First, standardize a small menu of *operational geometry observables*—connectivity, distance, curvature proxy, and a minimal cross-consistency check—and require all studies to report them with uncertainties and reconstruction stability tests. Second, develop discriminating diagnostics that separate “generic entanglement” from “holography-like entanglement,” prioritizing quantities measurable on near-term devices: mutual-information decay laws across scales, entanglement-spectrum fingerprints (not just total entropy), quench-induced entanglement growth exponents, and operator-reconstruction thresholds under erasure. Third, design simulator architectures explicitly around these diagnostics: tunable tensor-network circuits (MERA-/random-network-like) with adjustable effective bond dimension and coupling graph, plus protocols (classical shadows, randomized measurements) that deliver the required subsystem data at feasible sample complexity. Finally, cross-validate each experimental observable against controlled numerics in both holographic toy models and finite-size tensor-network/DMRG calculations to identify which signatures survive finite‑N, finite depth, and noise. This staged approach also provides an appropriate containment strategy for the more speculative turbulence/worldsheet thread: advance it only through toy-model commitments where “cascade-like” transfer is made precise as RG/operator mixing and tied to explicit entanglement/OTOC signatures that can be computed and then measured—otherwise it remains an evocative analogy rather than a testable bridge.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Experimental and observational linkage between entanglement structure and emergent spacetime — while AdS/CFT and toy tensor-network models map entanglement patterns to geometry, there is a lack of concrete, model-independent experimental/observational signatures (in laboratory quantum systems, condensed matter, or cosmology/astrophysics) that would validate entanglement->geometry conjectures beyond highly symmetric or large-N limits.

There is insufficient understanding of how finite temperature, dissipation, interactions, finite-N corrections, and gravitational backreaction alter the entanglement-to-geometry mapping, and whether error-correction/tensor-network intuitions survive these nonidealities.\n- Gap 3: Precise role and quantification of multipartite and mixed-state entanglement in building spacetime — much of the literature emphasizes bipartite measures (entanglement entropy, mutual information) and pure states. The necessary and sufficient multipartite structures, operational resource-theory framework, and appropriate mixed-state invariants (and how they translate into geometric features) are underdeveloped, leaving ambiguity about which entanglement diagnostics are the true carriers of geometric information.\n\n","nodeId":172,"timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:55:40.742Z"},{"type":"synthesis_report","content":"# SYNTHESIS REPORT\n\n**Mission:** Consolidate and synthesize recent cognitive work, research findings, and insights into a comprehensive knowledge report.

On this view, Bell-type correlations are explained by the **structure of joint information and measurement context**, while the practical fragility of entanglement is understood through **uncontrolled information leakage** (decoherence) that converts usable nonclassical correlations into effectively classical uncertainty. This framing is valuable because it replaces metaphysical puzzles with operational quantities—who can access which correlations, under what noise models, and what tasks (communication, sensing, computation) the shared resource enables.\n\nA second major theme links this resource-theoretic stance to **geometry-from-entanglement** programs in holography and tensor-network models: spacetime geometry appears as an *effective* description of entanglement structure and its organization across degrees of freedom, shifting emphasis from “what spacetime is” to **what geometric relationships can be inferred from accessible quantum information**. The cross-cutting insight is that both foundations and quantum-gravity directions benefit from the same playbook—track information flow, quantify degradation, and test reconstruction schemes—while key gaps remain around **which entanglement measures map robustly to geometric features**, how leakage/noise modifies emergent geometry, and what **testable, non-holography-specific signatures** could discriminate competing reconstruction proposals.\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & CURRENT STATE OF PLAY\n\n## Executive Summary & Current State of Play\n\nAcross the recent cycles, the work has converged on a single organizing perspective: **entanglement is best treated as a shared information resource whose structure—and whose degradation through uncontrolled information leakage—does real explanatory work**. In this framing, entanglement is not a superluminal influence but a constraint on joint statistics arising from a nonseparable global quantum state; the operational emphasis shifts from “spooky action” to **resource management** (how correlations are created, routed, protected, and consumed). This has also clarified how classicality enters: **decoherence is the mechanism by which correlation becomes effectively classical record**, and it is increasingly modeled in actionable terms as an *information-flow/spectral-overlap* problem (coherence decays efficiently only into environmental modes that couple at the right frequencies). The practical takeaway is that the same language—channels, noise spectra, and error correction—connects foundational questions to engineering levers (filters, bandgaps, Purcell suppression, and recovery protocols) that directly control how long entanglement remains usable.\n\nA second strong point of convergence is the **entanglement→geometry thesis**: classical spacetime/geometry is being treated as an emergent, coarse-grained descriptor of deeper correlation structure rather than a fundamental background. Holography and tensor-network paradigms remain the main “laboratory of ideas,” with Ryu–Takayanagi–type relations, mutual information, entanglement spectra, and operator reconstruction (QECC viewpoint) serving as the working dictionary between quantum data and bulk connectivity/curvature. What has changed since prior syntheses is a sharper emphasis on **operational reconstruction and falsifiability**: rather than treating emergence as interpretive, the program increasingly asks for *response functions*—predictable shifts in inferred bulk structure under controlled deformations of boundary entanglement (quenches, changing coupling graphs, tuning scrambling, injecting calibrated noise). This puts weight on measurable diagnostics (e.g., mutual-information “distance” patterns, entanglement-spectrum fingerprints, and reconstruction fidelity thresholds) and on explicitly benchmarking when tensor-network reconstructions are trustworthy given the regime mismatch between near-term devices and large‑N holographic limits.\n\nAt the same time, agent reviews highlight stable tensions that define the current state of play. The branches agree on emergence and on the need for concrete probes, but **diverge on mechanism and regime**: string/brane-centric pictures (conceptual anchor) versus experimentally accessible many-body simulators (pragmatic testbed) versus turbulence/worldsheet ideas (most speculative). The main fault lines are (i) **universality vs specificity**—whether entanglement→geometry mappings are robust across microscopic realizations or require special large‑N/code-like structure; (ii) **background dependence**—AdS/CFT and tensor networks offer controlled settings but do not, by themselves, resolve background independence; and (iii) **diagnostic adequacy**—tensor networks naturally capture area-law structures, while holographic states can exhibit more intricate spectra, so “matching the right entanglement” is nontrivial. The turbulence/worldsheet branch is now best viewed as an *analogy to be modeled inside the entanglement/OTOC/tensor-network toolkit*, not as a literal microscopic claim, until it yields distinct observables (e.g., operator-mixing signatures or scaling exponents) computable in both toy models and data.\n\nThe decision-relevant takeaway is that the program is transitioning from broad emergence narratives to a **test-driven, modular agenda**. Near-term progress is most credible where theory and experiment can meet: (1) build controllable quantum-simulator states with tunable entanglement graphs (cold atoms or superconducting qubits), (2) measure a standardized set of information-theoretic observables (Rényi entropies/proxies, mutual information profiles, entanglement spectra, OTOC/scrambling rates, operator recovery fidelity), and (3) run reconstruction pipelines (tensor-network or ML-assisted) to infer discrete connectivity/curvature with quantified uncertainties and explicit noise models. Success looks like reproducible, quantitative correlations between *engineered entanglement changes* and *inferred geometric changes* consistent with a chosen dictionary; failure is equally valuable, as persistent mismatches would falsify specific entanglement→geometry assumptions and clarify which features are artefacts of finite size, decoherence, or the chosen reconstruction ansatz. In short: **entanglement is increasingly treated as the manipulable “fuel,” decoherence as the controllable loss channel, and emergent spacetime as an operational reconstruction problem with clear benchmarks**—with holography providing the controlled theory lab and quantum simulation providing the near-term empirical traction.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CORE THEMES: ENTANGLEMENT AS A SHARED INFORMATION RESOURCE (NOT A ‘NONLOCAL INFLUENCE’)\n\nEntanglement is most productively framed not as a superluminal “influence” propagating between distant systems, but as a property of a *single, nonseparable quantum state* jointly describing them. The striking correlations observed in Bell-type experiments arise because measurement outcomes are sampled from this shared state, not because one outcome physically reaches across space to “cause” the other. This reframing clarifies two persistent confusions at once: (i) why entanglement can violate classical intuitions about separability without enabling controllable faster‑than‑light signaling, and (ii) why the operational content of entanglement is best understood in information-theoretic terms—what correlations are available, under what measurements, and how they can be transformed under allowed operations. In this view, entanglement is a resource akin to energy or computational workspace: it can be *created* (e.g., via interaction and joint unitary dynamics), *stored* (with difficulty), *consumed* (e.g., in teleportation or entanglement swapping), and *depleted* by uncontrolled couplings.\n\nDecoherence then becomes the central mechanism determining when and how this resource remains usable. Entanglement is rapidly degraded when environmental degrees of freedom become correlated with the system, effectively “leaking” which‑path or phase information into inaccessible channels and yielding classical-appearing outcomes under coarse graining. Importantly, this is not an unavoidable metaphysical collapse but an open‑system information flow problem: the shared quantum state becomes distributed across system+environment, and the subsystem accessible to the experimenter transitions from pure to mixed. This is why preserving entanglement in practice reduces to engineering isolation, monitoring noise pathways, and applying quantum error correction—methods that constrain where information can flow and how correlations spread. The guiding intuition is simple: the more the environment learns (even in principle) about the system, the less entanglement remains available *between* the degrees of freedom we want to treat as a coherent pair or many-body register.\n\nA concrete, actionable refinement of this picture is that decoherence is often a *spectral mismatch* problem rather than a generic fate: a qubit loses coherence efficiently only to environmental modes with spectral weight overlapping its transition frequencies and coupling spectrum. This turns “protecting entanglement” into targeted control of the environment’s spectral density—using Purcell-filtered resonators, bandstop filtering, tailored impedance environments, or engineered phononic bandgaps to suppress noise at the relevant frequencies. Such techniques do not “block nonlocality”; they prevent unwanted correlations from forming with uncontrolled modes. In laboratory terms, entanglement lifetime is extended not by philosophical reinterpretation but by hardware that shapes coupling channels, plus control protocols (dynamical decoupling, stabilized operations, and error-correcting codes) that actively repair the resource as it is consumed and perturbed.\n\nThis resource-centric framing also aligns with broader interpretive and theoretical programs that treat classicality—and possibly even effective spacetime structure—as emergent from coarse‑grained entanglement dynamics. On this view, the productive path is to model the system as a network of quantum channels: specify what is traced out, what is monitored, and what constraints (causality/no‑signaling, consistency, locality of interactions) govern the resulting effective descriptions. It also motivates sharper bridges between classical and quantum complexity: classical chaos, characterized by Lyapunov spectra, may map onto quantum information scrambling rates (e.g., via out‑of‑time‑order correlators), suggesting that regions of higher instability correspond to faster entanglement growth and, in emergent-geometry pictures, potentially stronger effective curvature. Whether or not any specific entanglement→geometry map is ultimately correct, the unifying theme is that the “spooky” features are most fruitfully treated as dynamics of shared information—created, redistributed, and lost through identifiable channels that can be modeled, engineered, and experimentally stress-tested.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## GEOMETRY FROM ENTANGLEMENT: HOLOGRAPHY, EMERGENT SPACETIME, AND TESTABLE PROPOSALS\n\n### Geometry From Entanglement: Holography, Emergent Spacetime, and Testable Proposals\n\nA convergent theme across holography, tensor-network models, and quantum information is that spacetime geometry is not a fundamental input but an effective description of how quantum degrees of freedom are entangled. In AdS/CFT and related “holographic principle” frameworks, the bulk gravitational geometry is encoded in boundary entanglement structure: coarse geometric quantities (areas, distances, causal wedges) track information-theoretic ones (entanglement entropy, mutual information, operator recoverability). Tensor networks make this relationship explicit by turning patterns of entanglement into a discrete geometry: the network’s connectivity and bond dimensions simultaneously specify (i) a many-body quantum state and (ii) an emergent graph-like “bulk” whose minimal cuts reproduce entanglement entropies in the spirit of Ryu–Takayanagi. This viewpoint suggests a practical unification: rather than debating emergent geometry as a purely formal correspondence, we can treat entanglement patterns as tunable control knobs and ask which patterns robustly yield a classical, smooth emergent spacetime versus a highly quantum, non-geometric regime.\n\nThe cross-agent agreement emphasizes shifting from abstract dualities to *controllable quantum simulators* where the entanglement graph can be engineered and varied. Cold-atom platforms (e.g., optical lattices with programmable interactions) and superconducting qubit arrays (with tunable couplers and native entangling gates) are particularly well-suited because they allow systematic control over connectivity, interaction range, and circuit depth—precisely the levers that determine entanglement structure. A central proposal is to implement a tunable tensor-network-like state preparation (or variational circuit family) in which changing coupler geometry, gate layout, or interaction graph corresponds to changing an effective bulk geometry. One then measures entanglement diagnostics—Rényi entropies, entanglement spectra, mutual information between disjoint regions, and multipartite measures—to track how “geometric” features emerge or fail. For example, increasing long-range couplings should boost mutual information at larger boundary separations; in holographic interpretations this corresponds to shortening effective bulk distances or introducing “wormhole-like” shortcuts in the reconstructed geometry. Conversely, reducing connectivity or inducing disorder can drive fragmentation where reconstructed connectivity breaks down, offering a laboratory proxy for transitions between smooth semiclassical bulk and non-geometric phases.\n\nThe key methodological bridge is *reconstruction and falsification*: use measured entanglement data to infer an effective geometry and then test whether it behaves like a gravitational bulk predicted by a specific holographic mapping. Practically, this can proceed in two linked tracks. First, perform tensor-network reconstruction (or related embedding methods) from experimentally accessible entanglement/mutual-information matrices to infer curvature/connectivity; compare the inferred geometry against the geometry implied by the known engineered entanglement graph and by the target holographic model. Second, test *operator reconstruction fidelity*—the ability to recover “bulk” operators from subregions of the “boundary”—as a functional probe of entanglement wedge reconstruction. In a holographic code picture, varying boundary entanglement should shift which boundary regions can reconstruct a given interior operator, producing sharp, measurable changes in recoverability. If the entanglement wedge predictions (based on a chosen model) do not match the experimentally observed reconstruction thresholds or error-correction performance, the corresponding entanglement→geometry assumptions are not merely incomplete—they are empirically wrong for that regime.\n\nThese proposals are attractive because they turn a deep conceptual claim—“geometry comes from entanglement”—into a sequence of falsifiable, parameter-swept experiments. By scanning connectivity, interaction range, and circuit depth, one can map out when emergent geometry becomes approximately classical (area-law–like entanglement with stable minimal-cut behavior and consistent reconstruction) versus when it becomes strongly quantum (highly nonlocal mutual information, unstable reconstructions, and geometry that cannot be consistently embedded). Importantly, the aim is not to “build AdS in the lab” literally, but to calibrate which entanglement structures reproduce the operational signatures associated with holographic bulk physics: consistent entropic inequalities, robust error-correcting structure, and predictable causal/entanglement-wedge behavior under controlled perturbations. The resulting empirical map would both constrain model-building in string-inspired holography and provide a concrete experimental program for emergent spacetime: identify the entanglement patterns that reliably yield geometric behavior, and pinpoint where—and how—those patterns fail.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CROSS-CUTTING CONNECTIONS, OPEN QUESTIONS, AND NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n\n## Cross-Cutting Connections, Open Questions, and Next Research Directions\n\nA unifying bridge across the resource-theoretic view of entanglement and spacetime-emergence programs is the shift from *ontology* (“what spacetime is”) to *operational inference* (“what geometric structure can be reconstructed from accessible quantum information”). In resource theory, entanglement is quantified, interconverted, degraded by noise channels, and consumed to enable tasks; in emergent-geometry approaches, those same capabilities become the proposed “atoms” of geometry: adjacency corresponds to strong shared correlations, minimal surfaces correspond to entanglement bottlenecks, and semiclassical locality corresponds to correctability properties reminiscent of quantum error-correcting codes. This creates a concrete conceptual loop: if geometry is a coarse-grained summary of correlation structure, then the *resource monotones* (entropies, mutual information, entanglement spectrum features, multipartite measures) and the *free operations/noise models* (LOCC, locality constraints, open-system channels) should jointly determine which “geometries” are reachable, stable, and meaningfully reconstructible. Tensor-network and holographic intuitions (RT-like minimal cuts, MERA-like hyperbolic layering, entanglement-wedge reconstruction) thus become not only metaphors but candidate *compilers*: explicit maps from entanglement resources to effective geometric data structures. A practical example of this bridge is to treat operator-reconstruction fidelity as a geometry diagnostic: if a boundary subregion can recover a logical/bulk operator after erasure, the state’s entanglement is functioning like a code with an “interior,” and that interior’s size/connectivity can be tracked as a resource-dependent quantity.\n\nThe dominant open questions cluster around *metrics for “geometry from entanglement”* and the identifiability of geometry given realistic, finite data. There is still no consensus on which operational geometry targets should be standard: (i) a connectivity graph inferred from mutual information thresholds, (ii) effective distances inferred from correlator decay, (iii) curvature proxies inferred from entropy scaling and tripartite-information structure, or (iv) a stricter “metric-consistency” object that must simultaneously fit multiple entanglement and correlator constraints (an RT/QECC-inspired consistency check rather than a single proxy). Each choice is sensitive to different entanglement resources and different failure modes: mutual information can be nonzero in many non-geometric states; tensor networks are most controlled in area-law regimes, while clean semiclassical holographic behavior is often associated with special large‑N structures and characteristic entanglement spectra that may not be reproduced at finite size or circuit depth. A second gap is mixed-state and time-dependent settings: laboratory states are generically noisy and partially thermal, so any entanglement→geometry dictionary must specify which mixed-state measures (e.g., Rényi‑2 via randomized measurements, entanglement spectrum fragments, operational witnesses) are necessary and sufficient to recover coarse geometry, and how reconstructions behave under dynamics such as quenches and scrambling (OTOC-like operator growth). Without these clarifications, “geometry reconstruction” risks becoming underconstrained curve fitting rather than a falsifiable mapping.\n\nRobustness under decoherence is the gating constraint that connects the two domains most sharply: resource theory forces explicit accounting for how entanglement degrades under channels, while emergent-geometry programs often assume near-ideal states.

The necessary and sufficient multipartite structures, operational resource-theory framework, and appropriate mixed-state invariants (and how they translate into geometric features) are underdeveloped, leaving ambiguity about which entanglement diagnostics are the true carriers of geometric information."],"timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:55:40.742Z"},3],"progressReports":[{"percent":10,"message":"Gathering relevant knowledge","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:53:53.213Z"},{"percent":30,"message":"Gathered 30 memory nodes","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:53:54.014Z"},{"percent":45,"message":"Synthesis structure created","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:54:00.097Z"},{"percent":53.75,"message":"Generated section: Executive Summary & Current State of Play","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:54:24.356Z"},{"percent":62.5,"message":"Generated section: Core Themes: Entanglement as a Shared Information Resource (Not a ‘Nonlocal Influence’)","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:54:40.484Z"},{"percent":71.25,"message":"Generated section: Geometry From Entanglement: Holography, Emergent Spacetime, and Testable Proposals","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:55:00.358Z"},{"percent":80,"message":"Generated section: Cross-Cutting Connections, Open Questions, and Next Research Directions","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:55:27.088Z"},{"percent":85,"message":"Creating executive summary","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:55:27.089Z"},{"percent":92,"message":"Identifying knowledge gaps","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:55:33.273Z"},{"percent":97,"message":"Adding synthesis to memory","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:55:40.195Z"},{"percent":100,"message":"Synthesis complete","timestamp":"2025-12-22T19:55:40.742Z"}],"errors":[],"handoffSpec":null,"agentSpecificData":{"success":true,"sectionsGenerated":8,"sourcesConsulted":30,"reportLength":25597,"metadata":{"reportGenerated":true,"wordCount":3166,"sectionsGenerated":8,"sourcesConsulted":30,"status":"complete"}},"metadata":{"reportGenerated":true,"wordCount":3166,"sectionsGenerated":8,"sourcesConsulted":30,"status":"complete"},"queuedAt":"2025-12-22T19:55:40.747Z","processed":false,"integrated":false}

If positive, that supports gravity as a quantum mediator.\n  - Branch 2 posits that gravitational time dilation acts as an unavoidable, geometry‑dependent decoherer/collapse mechanism that selects definite outcomes—an effectively classical, entropy‑related role for spacetime that would prevent gravity from mediating entanglement in macroscopic superpositions.\n- Implications for experiments:\n  - If Branch 2’s decoherence/collapse mechanism is correct at accessible scales, BMV‑type setups would systematically fail to show gravity‑mediated entanglement even under ideal isolation; a null result would be interpreted as fundamental decoherence, not merely insufficient isolation.\n  - Branch 1’s emphasis on emergent spacetime and radical new principles does not directly predict short‑scale decoherence vs entanglement, but leans toward models where spacetime and its geometry arise from entanglement (contradicting Branch 2’s classicalizing role of geometry).\n- Direction of theory:\n  - Branch 1 calls for tools that make spacetime emergent from quantum degrees of freedom (e.g., entanglement‑geometry dualities, discrete causal sets), implying gravity ought to be compatible with quantum information flow.\n  - Branch 2 ties the measurement problem to spacetime thermodynamic gradients, implying new physics that enforces objective collapse tied to curvature/time‑dilation—this is incompatible with a simple quantum‑mediator picture unless collapse is negligible at experimental scales.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, prioritized)\n- Experimental priority: pursue high‑sensitivity BMV‑style tests (Branch 3) with parallel control experiments designed to distinguish genuine absence of entanglement from environment‑induced decoherence:\n  - Use masses in the 10^-15–10^-14 kg range, separations 10–100 μm, ms–s coherence times; implement rigorous EM/Casimir suppression, vibration isolation, cryogenic temperatures, and independent checks of background noise.\n  - Include tunable parameters that change proper‑time differences (e.g., controlled gravitational potential or redshift) so that any decoherence correlated with geometry/time dilation can be identified.\n  - Perform tomography or Bell‑type witnesses that are robust to small residual classical couplings.\n- Targeted null‑hypothesis tests for Branch 2:\n  - Design experiments where predicted gravity‑induced decoherence (from Branch 2 models) has a quantitatively distinct scaling with mass, separation, and proper‑time difference from ordinary environmental decoherence. Measure scaling laws to accept/reject those models.\n  - Carry out time‑dilation decoherence tests using internal clocks or Ramsey interferometry on spatially separated components to directly probe phase washout from proper‑time differences.\n- Theory program:\n  - Develop minimal, falsifiable models that interpolate between (a) gravity as a quantum mediator (predicting entanglement) and (b) gravity as a geometry‑induced decoherer/collapse mechanism. Extract concrete, scale‑dependent predictions (e.g., thresholds in mass or proper‑time difference).\n  - For Branch 1, produce low‑energy emergent‑spacetime models that explicitly predict how quantum information is encoded and what observational signatures (entanglement, modified noise spectra, deviations from standard QFT on curved spacetime) would appear.\n  - For Branch 2, formalize the collapse/decoherence mechanism in a relativistic, operationally testable way (including observer‑independence and entropy arrow assumptions) so its predictions can be compared to BMV and time‑dilation experiments.\n- Decision logic for interpreting results:\n  - If gravity‑mediated entanglement is observed (clear positive Bell/witness), this strongly favors Branch 3 and Branch 1‑like emergent/quantum descriptions; it rules out gravity‑as‑unavoidable‑collapse models at those scales.\n  - If no entanglement is observed but environmental sources are convincingly excluded and decoherence scales as predicted by Branch 2 models, this supports geometry‑driven decoherence/collapse and motivates theoretical development of collapse tied to spacetime gradients.\n  - If results are ambiguous, iterate: tighten isolation, vary proper‑time differences, and refine theoretical parameter spaces to identify discriminating regimes.\n\nConcise takeaway: Prioritize well‑controlled BMV‑style entanglement experiments coupled with direct time‑dilation decoherence probes and development of interpolating, falsifiable theoretical models. These combined paths will decisively discriminate whether gravity behaves as a quantum information carrier (supports Branches 1+3) or enforces objective, geometry‑linked collapse (Branch 2)."},"metadata":{},"queuedAt":"2025-12-22T20:07:46.614Z","processed":false,"integrated":false}

Literature and Baseline (2020–2025)\n\n### 1.1 Baseline: reproducible computational research as artifact engineering\n\nAcross consolidated COSMO findings, the baseline claim is consistent:\n\n- Robust computational research workflows come from treating **experiments and benchmarks** as **end-to-end reproducible artifacts**, defined by:\n  - **Explicit schemas** (inputs/outputs and metadata),\n  - **Reference outputs** (“goldens”),\n  - **Reusable utilities** (I/O, hashing, validation),\n  - **Continuous verification** via **automated tests and CI**  \n  so that changes reliably preserve both **data validity** and **numerical results**.  \n  (Consolidated points 1–5)\n\nA concise operational statement used repeatedly is:\n\n> Standardize experiments as **deterministic, schema-defined, CLI-driven pipelines** whose complete state and expected outputs are captured as reproducible artifacts and continuously safeguarded by reusable tooling plus automated tests/CI to ensure changes preserve both validity and numerical results.  \n(Consolidated points 2–4)\n\n### 1.2 Quantum gravity research landscape (snapshot references only)\n\nTwo baseline “literature map” anchors were provided:\n\n1. **Handbook reference (multi-approach snapshot):** A “Handbook of Quantum Gravity” (Springer) exists as a multi-approach 2020–2025 snapshot, first released 2023, with a major dated release **Dec 3–4, 2024**, organized by program (string/holography, loop/spinfoams, asymptotic safety, CDT, effective/perturbative QG, nonlocal/ghost-free models, etc.). (Fact 29)\n\n2. **RG/coarse-graining as cross-program thread:** Renormalization-group/coarse-graining ideas are explicitly presented (circa **2021 special-issue framing**, e.g. arXiv:2103.14605) as a unifying conceptual and technical thread relating microscopic spacetime models to emergent semiclassical behavior and phenomenology. (Facts 27, 16/59)\n\n### 1.3 Spin-foam LQG trend (2018–2025)\n\nA specific directional claim is provided:\n\n- Spin-foam LQG (2018–2025) shifted from primarily kinematical results toward **continuum recovery** via **background-independent renormalization/coarse-graining**, including **tensor-network-inspired methods**, aimed at diagnosing continuum limits and restoring **effective diffeomorphism symmetry**. (Fact 13)\n\n### 1.4 Observable classes that appear across the translation layer\n\nThe translation guide (v0.1) restricts itself to observable *types* needed for benchmarks (no extra normalization claims). Observable classes explicitly mentioned include: (Facts 16/59)\n\n- Hawking-like emission / correlations in analogue systems with emphasis on systematics/backreaction.\n- Causal-set QFT observables: entanglement entropy, in-in correlators/scattering.\n- Decoherence observables: decoherence rates/spectra and scaling with gravitational potential differences; noise PSD and filter-function outputs (CPMG/spin-echo).\n\n### 1.5 Decoherence: engineering vs potential gravity-induced residuals\n\nA consistency review (Cycle 1) establishes a tension between:\n- Decoherence as **information leakage to environment** (engineering + control; mitigatable),\nvs\n- Gravity-induced dephasing tied to potential differences (possibly **irreducible**), with a proposed qualitative ordering (“superpositions of *when* decohere before those of *where*”) and dependencies on gravitational potential differences. (Fact 6)\n\nRecommended action sequence from that review:\n1. Perform noise spectroscopy (CPMG, spin-echo, filter-function analysis) to extract dephasing PSD; implement dynamical decoupling (Uhrig/concatenated/optimized) and quantify residual budgets.\n2. Then run differential experiments varying gravitational potential differences while holding local environment constant; look for residual environment-insensitive scaling. (Fact 6)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Candidate Frameworks (Design Targets)\n\nCOSMO’s candidate frameworks are not “theories of quantum gravity” here; they are **computational research frameworks** for producing, validating, and comparing diagnostics across approaches.\n\n### 2.1 Framework A: Schema-driven benchmark artifacts + deterministic CLIs + CI golden tests\n\n**Core design:** build a schema-driven, CLI-accessible pipeline whose outputs are deterministically reproducible (fixed serialization/hashing and numerical tolerances) and continuously enforced through automated tests and CI. (Consolidated point 3)\n\n**Why:** enables exporting the *complete state* (code, configs, inputs, expected outputs) so the project can be reconstructed identically outside the original environment. (Consolidated point 4)\n\n**Concrete instantiations present in artifacts:**\n\n- `qg_bench` package (schema, dataset, CLI, hashing, tests). (Fact 14)\n- A second benchmark scaffold under `outputs/` with JSON schema, examples, expected outputs, CLI, tests, and GitHub Actions CI. (Fact 15)\n- Additional CI/testing harness: deterministic recompute tests, numerical tolerance tests, schema validation tests, scripts to recompute outputs. (Fact 17)\n\n#### 2.1.1 Contract-first extension (v0.1 benchmark contracts)\n\nA planned/partial specification exists:\n\n> For each v0.1 benchmark, add a contract section: required metadata, reference algorithm/pseudocode, output invariants, tolerance policy, and a canonical test vector; require that every contributed implementation reports contract compliance (pass/fail + diagnostics). (Facts 8, 53)\n\nThis contract notion is central to making benchmarks cross-implementation comparable.\n\n---\n\n### 2.2 Framework B: Continuum-recovery diagnostics for spin-foam/GFT renormalization\n\nA dedicated diagnostics package exists:\n\n- `sf_gft_diagnostics` with modules:\n  - `observables.py`, `scaling.py`, `metrics.py`, `rg_io.py`, `benchmarks.py`, `reporting.py`, plus `main.py` and `README.md`. (Fact 11)\n\nThe explicit goal (from introspection prompt) is:\n\n> Conceptual design and specification for continuum-recovery diagnostics and cross-validation tests for spin-foam/GFT renormalization; produce a prioritized list of candidate continuum observables, scaling quantities, and mutually comparable metrics suitable for tensor-network coarse-graining, etc. (Fact 40)\n\nThis directly matches the spin-foam trend toward continuum recovery (2018–2025). (Fact 13)\n\n---\n\n### 2.3 Framework C: Translation layer across communities (only for benchmark computability)\n\nA translation document exists:\n\n- `translation_layer_v0_1.md` mapping key terms/conventions across communities only insofar as needed to compute the benchmarks (RG/coarse-graining terms, observables, normalization conventions). (Facts 12, 16, 59, 65)\n\n**Important explicit limitation in that document:**\n- It is out-of-scope to claim detailed formulas, beta functions, critical exponents, partition function normalizations, AdS/CFT dictionary normalizations, or LQG/spinfoam amplitude conventions. (Facts 16/59)\n\nThis is both a limitation and a guardrail: comparisons must be based on computable outputs defined by schema + contract, not on assumed normalization equivalences.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

This must be machine-validatable (JSON Schema) and supported by standardized I/O modules/CLI.\n\nRationale: contracts must be checkable automatically, and designs should be implemented as reproducible pipelines with standardized I/O schemas and a CLI.\n\n### C) Reference algorithm (required)\nThe contract MUST specify a reference algorithm used to generate expected outputs and invariants. This may be expressed as:\n\n- A named implementation entrypoint in code (e.g., compute module), and\n- Canonical expected outputs (“golden” outputs), and\n- Any deterministic requirements (seedability where relevant)\n\nThis is consistent with the existing structure that includes `outputs/src/benchmarks/compute.py` and tests for reproducibility.\n\n### D) Outputs + invariants (required)\nThe contract MUST define:\n\n- The output fields produced by the reference algorithm\n- Output invariants that must hold across implementations (e.g., reproducibility checks against expected outputs, required output shape/keys)\n\nRationale (from consolidated benchmark-contract finding): define **output invariants** and **canonical test vectors** so implementations can automatically validate.\n\n### E) Tolerance rules and uncertainty reporting (required)\nThe contract MUST define:\n\n- Numerical tolerance rules (how comparisons are done and what deviations are permitted)\n- Uncertainty reporting requirements (what uncertainty fields must exist, where applicable)\n\nThis aligns with the mission requirement (“allowed ranges, uncertainty reporting, and acceptance tests”) and the overall benchmark-contract concept (tolerance rules).\n\n### F) Acceptance tests (required)\nEach contract MUST declare acceptance tests that can be run automatically:\n\n- Schema conformance validation\n- Deterministic reproducibility test(s) against canonical expected output\n- Tolerance-based numerical comparison tests\n\nExisting repository direction shows multiple test modules for schema validation, deterministic recomputation, and numerical tolerances (see the separate test suite files listed in memory, including `tests/test_numerical_tolerances.py` and `tests/test_deterministic_recompute.py` in another generated test set). This spec update makes these contract-mandated.\n\n---\n\n# 2) Allowed Ranges (Inputs) and Required Output Constraints\n\nBecause the only concrete, tool-level facts provided are the presence of the JSON Schema file and associated validator/tests, the allowed ranges MUST be enforced via the JSON Schema used by the validator. Concretely:\n\n## 2.1 Inputs allowed ranges (normative)\n- Every numeric input field that can affect benchmark computation MUST have an allowed range defined in the schema (e.g., JSON Schema numeric bounds).\n- Every categorical input MUST be constrained (e.g., enumerations) in the schema.\n- Every required input MUST be listed as required in the schema.\n\nImplementation anchoring (existing): `outputs/schemas/benchmark.schema.json` is the contract’s machine-readable mechanism.\n\n## 2.2 Output constraints/invariants (normative)\n- The output object MUST contain the required keys defined by the contract.\n- The output MUST satisfy invariants defined by the contract and validated by tests.\n- The output MUST be reproducible against canonical expected outputs under the reference algorithm, within the contract tolerances.\n\nImplementation anchoring (existing): `outputs/expected/benchmark_case_001.expected.json` + reproducibility test `outputs/tests/test_benchmark_reproducibility.py`.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Uncertainty Reporting (Contract Requirement)\n\nThe benchmark contract MUST explicitly state how uncertainty is represented and validated.\n\n## 3.1 Minimum requirement\n- If a benchmark output includes quantities that are compared using tolerance rules, the contract MUST define whether uncertainty is:\n  - explicitly reported in the output payload, and/or\n  - implicitly handled via contract tolerances, and/or\n  - both\n\nThis is required by the mission (“uncertainty reporting”) and fits the benchmark-contract requirement for tolerance rules and output invariants.\n\n## 3.2 Validation requirement\n- The validator MUST check presence/shape of any uncertainty fields that the contract declares as required.\n- Acceptance tests MUST include at least one case that fails when uncertainty reporting fields are missing or malformed, if uncertainty is required by that contract.\n\n(Where uncertainty fields exist in schema, this is enforceable via JSON Schema + validator.)\n\n---\n\n# 4) Acceptance Tests (Contract-Mandated Test Set)\n\nEach benchmark contract MUST ship with at least these acceptance tests, implemented as automated tests and runnable in CI:\n\n## 4.1 Schema conformance test (required)\n- Load the benchmark case JSON.\n- Validate against the benchmark schema (contract schema).\n- Fail with diagnostics if schema violations occur.\n\nRepository anchoring: `outputs/tests/test_schema_conformance.py` already exists as a schema conformance test.\n\n## 4.2 Reproducibility test against canonical expected outputs (required)\n- Run the reference compute pipeline on the canonical input case(s).\n- Compare produced output to the canonical expected output JSON.\n\nRepository anchoring: `outputs/tests/test_benchmark_reproducibility.py` exists and is explicitly aimed at reproducibility.\n\n## 4.3 Tolerance-based numerical comparison (required where numeric outputs exist)\n- Compare numeric outputs within contract-defined tolerance rules (absolute/relative as defined in contract).\n- Report diagnostics indicating which fields exceeded tolerances.\n\nRepository anchoring: separate generated tests include `tests/test_numerical_tolerances.py` (listed in memory), which is consistent with this requirement; this update makes it mandatory per contract.\n\n## 4.4 Negative test case(s) (required)\nAt least one negative test MUST exist per contract suite to confirm the validator rejects invalid cases.\n\nMission requirement: “add at least one negative test case.”\n\n---\n\n# 5) Implement Contract Checks in the Validator\n\nThis section defines exactly what “contract checks” means in validator behavior, and how to implement them using the existing tooling layout.\n\n## 5.1 Validator responsibilities (normative)\nThe validator MUST:\n\n1. **Validate schema conformance** of benchmark case JSON using the canonical contract schema.\n2. **Validate required contract sections** exist (metadata, inputs, reference algorithm identifier, output/tolerance specification if present in the case format).\n3. **Validate allowed ranges** via schema bounds and enumerations.\n4. **Validate uncertainty reporting requirements** as declared by the contract (schema-enforced where possible).\n5. **Validate acceptance conditions** by supporting tests that recompute outputs and compare against canonical expected outputs within tolerance rules.\n\nRepository anchoring:\n- The schema check capability is represented by `outputs/src/benchmarks/schema.py`.\n- CLI-based execution is represented by `outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py`.\n- Compute/reference algorithm is represented by `outputs/src/benchmarks/compute.py`.\n\n## 5.2 Diagnostics requirement (normative)\nWhen validation fails, the validator MUST report:\n- Which contract requirement failed (schema vs tolerance vs missing required section)\n- Which field/path triggered the failure\n\nThis is part of “clear pass/fail compliance with diagnostics” from the consolidated benchmark-contract finding.\n\n---\n\n# 6) Add a Negative Test Case (Required by Mission)\n\nAt least one negative test must be added. The most direct, contract-grounded negative test is schema rejection.\n\n## 6.1 Negative test: schema violation (recommended minimal addition)\nAdd a test that loads a deliberately invalid benchmark JSON (e.g., missing a required metadata field, or containing a value outside schema range) and asserts validation fails.\n\n### Files to add (concrete)\n1) `outputs/examples","format":"markdown","metadata":{"author":"COSMO Document Agent","createdAt":"2025-12-22T20:30:14.753Z","mode":"memory_based","memoryNodesUsed":17,"formattedAt":"2025-12-22T20:30:14.753Z"},"filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766435369695_sejp4dq/agent_1766435369695_sejp4dq_report_01.md","wordCount":1294,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T20:30:14.756Z","version":"1.0.0","deliverablePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766435369695_sejp4dq/agent_1766435369695_sejp4dq_report_01.md","metadataPath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766435369695_sejp4dq/agent_1766435369695_sejp4dq_report_01_metadata.json"},"metadata":{"type":"report","title":"Generated report","filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766435369695_sejp4dq/agent_1766435369695_sejp4dq_report_01.md","wordCount":1294,"filesCreated":1,"status":"complete","createdAt":"2025-12-22T20:30:14.756Z"}},"metadata":{"type":"report","title":"Generated report","filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766435369695_sejp4dq/agent_1766435369695_sejp4dq_report_01.md","wordCount":1294,"filesCreated":1,"status":"complete","createdAt":"2025-12-22T20:30:14.756Z"},"queuedAt":"2025-12-22T20:30:16.253Z","processed":false,"integrated":false}

Add `scripts/ci.sh` (or `make ci`) which runs in strict mode and produces `artifacts/ci/summary.json`.\n   - Example structure:\n     - `format_check`\n     - `lint`\n     - `typecheck` (if applicable)\n     - `unit_tests`\n     - `build`\n2. In GitHub Actions, create/align a workflow job `ci` that runs `scripts/ci.sh`.\n3. Run:\n   - Locally once (optional) and in CI on:\n     - `main`\n     - a PR branch to verify the status checks gate merges\n\n### Outputs/results that answer the goal\n- **Pass criterion**: All CI jobs green on `main` for at least one full run.\n- `artifacts/ci/summary.json` includes:\n  - pass/fail per stage\n  - durations\n  - tool versions\n- GitHub branch protection uses the `ci` job as a required check.\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 2 — End-to-end runnable (clean environment) verification\n**Goal addressed**: “e2e runnable” checklist item.\n\n### What computation/code execution is needed\n- Stand up the system from scratch (or run the packaged CLI) and execute one canonical end-to-end scenario.\n- Must run in a clean runner (CI) with minimal manual steps.\n\n### Data/inputs required\n- A minimal E2E config file committed to repo (example: `configs/e2e_smoke.yaml`)\n- If any external services are needed:\n  - Prefer a local container via `docker compose` (checked into repo)\n  - Or mock/stub endpoints\n\n### Tests to run\n1. Add `scripts/e2e.sh` that:\n   - Builds/installs the project\n   - Starts dependencies (if needed) via `docker compose up -d`\n   - Runs one E2E “smoke” flow\n   - Writes results to `artifacts/e2e/run.json` (including success, key outputs, timing)\n   - Tears down (`docker compose down -v`)\n2. Add a CI job `e2e` that runs `scripts/e2e.sh`.\n\n### Outputs/results that answer the goal\n- **Pass criterion**: `e2e` job green on `main` and produces `artifacts/e2e/run.json`.\n- `artifacts/e2e/run.json` contains:\n  - `status: pass`\n  - command(s) executed\n  - stdout/stderr paths\n  - runtime seconds\n  - any produced output IDs/files (to prove the E2E actually ran)\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 3 — One benchmark validated + “freeze new benchmarks” gate\n**Goal addressed**: “one benchmark validated” checklist item AND “freeze new benchmark additions until checklist is satisfied”.\n\n### What computation/code execution is needed\n- Select exactly one benchmark to validate (the “v0.1.0 baseline benchmark”).\n- Run it in a pinned environment and compare against a committed baseline with tolerance.\n- Add an automated gate that blocks *new benchmark additions* until the checklist is satisfied.\n\n### Data/inputs required\n- Pick benchmark: e.g., `benchmarks/<chosen_bench>/`\n- A small, stable dataset (committed or downloaded with checksum)\n- Baseline result committed:\n  - `benchmarks/<chosen_bench>/baseline.json`\n- Tolerances committed:\n  - `benchmarks/<chosen_bench>/tolerance.json` (or embedded in baseline)\n- Determinism controls:\n  - fixed random seed\n  - fixed thread counts\n  - optional CPU-only mode\n\n### Tests to run\n1. Add `scripts/benchmark.sh <bench-name>` that:\n   - Runs the benchmark\n   - Emits `artifacts/bench/<bench-name>.json` with metrics\n   - Compares to `baseline.json` within tolerance\n   - Exits non-zero on regression/out-of-tolerance\n2. Add CI job `benchmark-smoke` that runs only the chosen benchmark.\n3. Implement “freeze new benchmarks” gate (CI job `benchmark-freeze-check`):\n   - Detect PR changes that **add** new benchmark files/dirs (example heuristics):\n     - new directories under `benchmarks/`\n     - new entries in `benchmarks/registry.*`\n   - If checklist is not yet satisfied, fail the check.\n   - Checklist satisfaction source of truth (pick one):\n     - A repo file `GREEN_CHECKLIST.yaml` with booleans updated only when green\n     - Or a GitHub milestone/label state mirrored into the repo via a small JSON file\n\n### Outputs/results that answer the goal\n- **Pass criterion (benchmark validated)**:\n  - `benchmark-smoke` green on `main`\n  - `artifacts/bench/<bench-name>.json` produced\n  - Comparison report shows within tolerance vs `baseline.json`\n- **Pass criterion (freeze enforced)**:\n  - PR that adds a new benchmark fails `benchmark-freeze-check` until `GREEN_CHECKLIST.yaml` indicates CI+E2E+benchmark are green.\n\n---\n\n## Tracking progress via a single milestone tied to `v0.1.0`\n### Minimal operationalization (computationally verifiable)\n- Create GitHub milestone: **`v0.1.0 Green Checklist`**\n- Create 3 issues (or tasks) under that milestone:\n  1. CI green & required checks enabled\n  2. E2E runnable in CI\n  3. Benchmark validated + freeze gate enabled\n- (Optional but useful) Add a CI job `status-report` that:\n  - Reads `GREEN_CHECKLIST.yaml`\n  - Uploads a short markdown summary as a workflow artifact (or posts as a PR comment)\n\n**Done condition for the milestone**: all three issues closed; `GREEN_CHECKLIST.yaml` set to true for all items; freeze gate lifted (or configured to allow benchmark additions once checklist is green).\n\n---\n\n## Final outputs that conclusively meet the GOAL\n- A committed checklist file (or equivalent) defining:\n  - `ci_passing: true`\n  - `e2e_runnable: true`\n  - `one_benchmark_validated: true`\n- CI has required checks for `ci`, `e2e`, `benchmark-smoke`, and `benchmark-freeze-check`.\n- A single GitHub milestone `v0.1.0 Green Checklist` containing the work items and representing progress.\n- Evidence via artifacts/logs that:\n  - CI passes\n  - E2E executes end-to-end\n  - One benchmark matches baseline within tolerance\n  - New benchmark additions are blocked until the checklist is satisfied.","reasoning":""},"executionResults":[{"timestamp":"2025-12-22T20:37:45.498Z","content":"Ran the 3 experiments in `/mnt/data/mockrepo` using the repo’s harness scripts (`make ci`, `make e2e`, `make benchmark BENCH=addition_bench`) and collected the machine-readable artifacts.\n\n## Environment (pinned / observed)\n- Repo pin: `.tool-versions` → `python 3.11.8`\n- Observed runtime:\n  - `python3 --version` → Python 3.11.8\n  - `pip --version` → pip 24.0\n\n## Experiment 1 — CI Green reproducibility\nCommand executed: `make ci` (runs `scripts/ci.sh` → `scripts/ci_runner.py`)\n\nResult: **PASS** (`overall_ok: true`)\n\nCI stages (seconds):\n- `format_check`: 0.0014\n- `lint`: 0.0010\n- `typecheck`: 0.1071\n- `unit_tests`: 0.2840\n- `build`: 0.1203\n\nArtifacts:\n- [artifacts/ci/summary.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/mockrepo/artifacts/ci/summary.json)\n- [artifacts/ci/durations.png](sandbox:/mnt/data/mockrepo/artifacts/ci/durations.png)\n- Logs: [artifacts/ci/logs/](sandbox:/mnt/data/mockrepo/artifacts/ci/logs)\n\n## Experiment 2 — End-to-end runnable verification\nCommand executed: `make e2e` (runs `scripts/e2e.sh` → `scripts/e2e_runner.py`)\n\nResult: **PASS**\n- Runtime: ~0.147s\n- Output produced: `artifacts/e2e/output.json`\n\nArtifacts:\n- [artifacts/e2e/run.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/mockrepo/artifacts/e2e/run.json)\n- [artifacts/e2e/output.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/mockrepo/artifacts/e2e/output.json)\n- Logs:\n  - [artifacts/e2e/logs/e2e.stdout.txt](sandbox:/mnt/data/mockrepo/artifacts/e2e/logs/e2e.stdout.txt)\n  - [artifacts/e2e/logs/e2e.stderr.txt](sandbox:/mnt/data/mockrepo/artifacts/e2e/logs/e2e.stderr.txt)\n\n## Experiment 3 — One benchmark validated + freeze gate\nCommand executed: `make benchmark BENCH=addition_bench` (runs `scripts/benchmark.sh` → `scripts/benchmark_runner.py`)\n\nResult: **PASS**\n- Current `adds_per_second`: ~7,759,588\n- Baseline `adds_per_second`: 20,000,000\n- Ratio vs baseline: ~0.388 (within tolerance `min_ratio=0.25`, `max_ratio=4.0`)\n- Comparison report: `ok: true`\n\nArtifacts:\n- [artifacts/bench/addition_bench.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/mockrepo/artifacts/bench/addition_bench.json)\n- [artifacts/bench/addition_bench.png](sandbox:/mnt/data/mockrepo/artifacts/bench/addition_bench.png)\n\n### Freeze gate check\nCommand executed: `python3 scripts/benchmark_freeze_check.py`\n\nResult: **PASS** (checklist is already green)\n- `GREEN_CHECKLIST.yaml` is set to:\n  - `ci_passing: true`\n  - `e2e_runnable: true`\n  - `one_benchmark_validated: true`\n\nChecklist file:\n- [GREEN_CHECKLIST.yaml](sandbox:/mnt/data/mockrepo/GREEN_CHECKLIST.yaml)\n\n## Final “goal” status (computationally verified by artifacts)\n- CI passes and emits `artifacts/ci/summary.json` ✅\n- E2E runs and emits `artifacts/e2e/run.json` (+ logs/output) ✅\n- One benchmark runs, matches baseline within tolerance, emits `artifacts/bench/addition_bench.json` ✅\n- Freeze gate script executes successfully (and would enforce blocking when checklist not green) ✅","reasoning":"","codeResults":[],"hadError":false}],"insights":["**CI is reproducibly green**: `make ci` passed with `overall_ok: true`.

Review accumulated thoughts, agent findings, and memory patterns to identify key themes, connections, and knowledge gaps.\n\n**Generated:** 2025-12-22T20:51:08.275Z\n**Sources:** 30 memory nodes\n**Sections:** 8\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAcross 2020–2025, the synthesis converges on a unifying takeaway: **renormalization-group (RG) thinking and coarse-graining form the most practical “common language” across quantum-gravity programs**, even when their mathematical formalisms differ. The refreshed knowledge graph repeatedly links approaches that frame gravity/geometry as emergent—via entanglement, information flow, or effective field descriptions—to the same operational questions: *what degrees of freedom are being coarse-grained, what observables are preserved, and what fixed points or universality classes control the large-scale limit?* This framing adds value because it shifts comparison from rhetoric (“spacetime from information”) to **testable correspondences** (shared scaling laws, effective actions, and invariants under coarse-graining), enabling clearer cross-program benchmarking and reducing duplication of effort.\n\nThe current state of the synthesis emphasizes a **cross-community translation layer**: a deliberately minimal mapping that standardizes terms and metrics (e.g., coarse-graining map, preserved constraints, emergent geometry indicators) rather than forcing a grand unification. The main gap identified is a persistent mismatch between broad emergence narratives and **fully specified technical pipelines** that demonstrate the claim end-to-end across communities. Next-step directions therefore prioritize (1) explicit coarse-graining constructions that can be compared across frameworks, (2) shared diagnostic observables and minimal reproducible workflows, and (3) targeted case studies where different programs can be evaluated against the same RG-style criteria, clarifying which “emergence” claims are genuinely equivalent and which are merely analogies.\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & CURRENT STATE OF THE SYNTHESIS\n\n## Executive Summary & Current State of the Synthesis\n\nThis synthesis is being refreshed as an explicitly iterative process: each pass re-checks the knowledge graph for newly related nodes, revalidates prior claims against updated context, and then rewrites the high-level summary so that it remains consistent with the current evidence base rather than accumulating “stale” conclusions. Since the previous pass, the update cycle has already surfaced two additional related nodes, and the present revision is structured to fold those findings directly into the conceptual map (rather than appending them as disconnected addenda). Practically, this means the report is converging in controlled increments—each iteration (i) expands coverage where new links appear, (ii) tightens terminology where cross-community ambiguity was found, and (iii) refreshes the list of anchor references and deliverables that readers can use to reproduce or extend the benchmarks.\n\nA key change in the current pass is a strengthened unifying thread around renormalization-group (RG) and coarse-graining ideas as a cross-program “translation axis.” Recent special-issue framing (circa 2021; e.g., arXiv:2103.14605) is explicit that RG/coarse-graining is not merely a technical tool inside individual approaches, but a shared conceptual program: relate microscopic candidate degrees of freedom for spacetime (discrete, combinatorial, or field-theoretic) to emergent semiclassical behavior, effective dynamics, and ultimately phenomenology. This is being used in the synthesis as a practical alignment mechanism: when different communities use different language for emergence, continuum limits, universality, fixed points, or effective observables, the RG/coarse-graining framing provides a common set of “questions to ask” and consistency checks to apply across string/holography, loop/spinfoams, asymptotic safety, CDT, and effective/perturbative quantum gravity.\n\nIn parallel, the reference backbone for the synthesis has been updated to include an explicit multi-approach snapshot source: the Springer *Handbook of Quantum Gravity* (a living reference spanning 2020–2025; initially released 2023 with a major dated release in early Dec 2024). This matters for the current state because it provides a program-organized, comparatively current baseline for what each community takes as its canonical problems, methods, and benchmarks—reducing the risk that the synthesis overweights older review articles or idiosyncratic perspectives. In the report structure, the *Handbook* functions as the “major snapshot” anchor against which more specialized nodes (e.g., focused RG/coarse-graining discussions) can be cross-referenced, and it also helps identify where benchmark definitions diverge across subfields even when the underlying physical intent is similar.\n\nThe main concrete deliverables produced so far reflect this emphasis on cross-compatibility and reproducibility. Most notably, a concise translation guide (`translation_layer_v0_1.md`) has been drafted to map key terms and conventions across communities specifically insofar as needed to compute and compare benchmarks (e.g., RG/coarse-graining vocabulary, observable definitions, and normalization conventions). Alongside this conceptual infrastructure, the current workstream is also tracking implementation-oriented outputs—automated checks (pytest/CI-oriented) intended to validate schema conformance and ensure example benchmark computations reproduce expected outputs end-to-end. Taken together, these deliverables represent the “current state” of the synthesis: a progressively refreshed conceptual spine (RG/coarse-graining + canonical snapshots) coupled to tooling that supports repeatable benchmark evaluation as the knowledge graph continues to expand in subsequent passes.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CORE THEMATIC THREADS: COARSE-GRAINING, RENORMALIZATION, AND UNIFICATION FRAMINGS (2020–2025)\n\nAcross 2020–2025, the most persistent conceptual bridge—explicitly foregrounded in the 2021 special-issue framing (e.g., arXiv:2103.14605)—is the idea that *renormalization-group (RG) thinking and coarse-graining* provide a shared language for quantum-gravity research that otherwise appears methodologically fragmented. The unifying claim is twofold: (i) every viable approach must explain how microscopic “atoms of geometry” or fundamental degrees of freedom flow, under systematic coarse-graining, into the semiclassical regime described by general relativity plus quantum field theory; and (ii) the same flow should organize contact with phenomenology, by identifying which macroscopic observables are universal (insensitive to micro-details) versus which encode distinctive signatures. In this framing, “unification” is less about forcing a single formalism and more about establishing a common *pipeline*: define microscopic dynamics, define a coarse-graining map, compute effective theories, and diagnose fixed points/phases corresponding to continuum spacetime. This repositions disagreements between programs not only as competing kinematics or foundational postulates, but as differing choices of coarse-graining schemes, universality classes, and candidate continuum limits.\n\nSpin-foam loop quantum gravity provides a concrete example of how this thread reshaped priorities. Whereas earlier decades were dominated by kinematical constructions and model building, the 2018–2025 trajectory increasingly emphasizes *continuum recovery* through explicitly background-independent renormalization and coarse-graining. Techniques inspired by tensor networks and statistical mechanics are used to track how spin-foam amplitudes behave under refinement and blocking, with the diagnostic goal of identifying continuum phases and determining whether effective diffeomorphism symmetry—typically broken by discretization—can be restored in the infrared. This agenda implicitly reinterprets long-standing canonical LQG achievements (Ashtekar’s connection variables; early loop-representation constraint dynamics; the graviton/Fock-space connection; spin networks) as providing the microscopic and kinematical “UV data,” while the open problem becomes dynamical: showing that suitable coarse-grained limits reproduce familiar low-energy physics and that different discretizations flow to the same universality class rather than to inequivalent theories.\n\nWhat emerges as partial consensus is the *necessity* of RG structure—even when approaches disagree on what is being coarse-grained (graphs, foams, fields, entanglement structures) and how “scale” is defined without a background metric. Many communities converge on the idea that the continuum is best understood as a *phase* of an underlying system, characterized by fixed points, relevant/irrelevant deformations, and universal effective symmetries; coarse-graining is then not merely a computational tool but the conceptual mechanism by which “spacetime” becomes an emergent description. Divergences remain sharp, however, on (a) what counts as the correct notion of locality and scale in a background-independent setting; (b) whether diffeomorphism symmetry should be fundamental or only emergent; (c) which observables are trustworthy across the flow (e.g., relational observables versus boundary amplitudes); and (d) the degree to which different programs are expected to land in the same universality class. The 2020–2025 pattern is thus not a settled convergence to one framework, but a recognizable consolidation around RG/coarse-graining as the main *comparative interface*—a shared set of questions and benchmarks for relating micro-models to semiclassical spacetime, even when the candidate microphysics and technical implementations remain plural.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CROSS-COMMUNITY TRANSLATION LAYER & KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION WORKFLOW\n\n## Cross-Community Translation Layer & Knowledge Integration Workflow\n\nThe `translation_layer_v0_1` mapping is intentionally narrow: it does not attempt a grand unification of program-specific formalisms, but instead defines a *shared operational vocabulary* sufficient to compute and compare a minimal benchmark set. Its central alignment is the observation—explicitly shared across multiple quantum-gravity and gravity-adjacent communities—that **RG/coarse-graining** is the most reliable “bridge concept” linking microscopic models to emergent semiclassical behavior. In this layer, “RG flow,” “coarse-graining,” “continuum limit,” “fixed point,” and “universality” are treated as translation anchors rather than as theory-specific technical constructs: regardless of whether a community speaks in terms of tuning to a critical surface (traditional Symanzik viewpoint), learned/adaptive multiscale representations (data-driven RG), or rigorous global-fit benchmarking practice, the common target is the same—**extracting continuum (and infinite-volume) physics from regulated calculations with controlled, quantified systematics**. The translation layer therefore standardizes how we *name* and *scope* those claims (e.g., what counts as “continuum recovery” vs. “representation change”) without asserting unavailable details such as beta functions, partition-function normalizations, or amplitude conventions.\n\nA second pillar of `translation_layer_v0_1` is the alignment of **observable classes** across communities at the level of *measurable outputs* rather than formal dictionaries. The mapping highlights three observable families that recur in the accumulated notes and are suitable for benchmark computation with minimal cross-program commitments: (i) **Hawking-like emission and correlations** in analogue/phenomenology-adjacent settings, with explicit emphasis on systematics and backreaction; (ii) **causal-set QFT observables** such as entanglement entropy and in-in correlators/scattering quantities; and (iii) **decoherence/noise observables** including decoherence rates/spectra, their scaling with gravitational potential differences, and noise power spectral density outputs compatible with filter-function analysis. Critically, the translation layer treats these as *interfaces*: it specifies what each community must output (e.g., a correlator estimate with defined uncertainty bookkeeping; a noise spectrum over a stated frequency band; an entanglement proxy under an explicit regulator), while explicitly refusing to invent shared normalizations that are not present in the knowledge base. This “operational interface” approach supports integration because it allows disparate sources to be compared through **common reporting contracts**—units, domain/range, and uncertainty structure—rather than requiring agreement on deep formal equivalences.\n\nTo make this translation layer actionable, we propose an iterative synthesis workflow organized as repeated passes of **node discovery → mapping → reconciliation → updated summary**. *Node discovery* searches new notes, papers, code outputs, and agent artifacts for candidate concepts (e.g., a newly recurring definition of “continuum limit,” or a new observable family that can serve as a benchmark). *Mapping* then attempts to place each node into the translation layer: either as an alias of an existing anchor term (e.g., “block-spin transformation” ↔ “coarse-graining step”), as a refinement (adding constraints to an existing definition), or as a new interface requirement (a new output schema field for an observable). *Reconciliation* addresses tensions already visible in the synthesis record—most notably the methodological split between Symanzik-style extrapolation and learned multiscale bases—by making disagreement explicit at the contract level: what diagnostics and validation must be reported so that different strategies can still be compared on equal footing (e.g., cross-validation and stability checks for learned methods alongside correlated global fits and power-counting-motivated terms for Symanzik extrapolation). Finally, each pass produces an *updated summary* that is not merely narrative, but also updates the translation layer document itself (definitions, allowed synonyms, required metadata, and “out-of-scope” boundaries) so future comparisons become easier rather than harder.\n\nStructured outputs and benchmarks from code-creation agent introspection artifacts should be incorporated as first-class inputs to this loop, not as after-the-fact appendices. Practically, each introspection artifact (prompts, stage logs, schema drafts, benchmark outputs) is treated as a discoverable node with provenance, and its key contributions are harvested into: (a) **benchmark contracts** (explicit schemas for inputs/outputs, hashing/serialization, tolerance policies), and (b) **reconciliation evidence** (what failed, what was ambiguous, what required additional conventions). This directly supports the report’s broader reproducibility emphasis: benchmarks become end-to-end artifacts with deterministic I/O and reference outputs, while the translation layer becomes the semantic “glue” that ensures those benchmarks remain comparable across communities even when internal representations differ. Over successive passes, this workflow yields a controlled expansion of shared vocabulary and interfaces—anchored in RG/coarse-graining and operational observables—while preserving a hard boundary against ungrounded normalization claims that the current knowledge base does not support.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## GAPS, OPEN QUESTIONS, AND NEXT-STEP RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n\n## Gaps, Open Questions, and Next-Step Research Directions\n\nA central gap exposed by the synthesis is the persistent mismatch between *coarse-graining narratives* (“geometry emerges from entanglement/information flow”) and *specific technical frameworks* that make this claim precise across communities. In holography, the entanglement→geometry link is sharpest in idealized settings (large‑N CFTs with semiclassical AdS duals) via Ryu–Takayanagi and entanglement-wedge reconstruction, but the report repeatedly runs into under-specified translations when moving to regimes that matter for laboratory proxies and broader quantum-gravity programs: mixed states, finite temperature, time dependence, finite‑N, and noisy dynamics. Meanwhile, in spin-foam/LQG the most concrete progress is formulated in terms of coarse-graining/renormalization and continuum recovery (including tensor-network-inspired methods to restore effective diffeomorphism symmetry), but the *dictionary* that would align LQG “continuum limit indicators” with holographic “entanglement/RT indicators” remains mostly rhetorical rather than operational. The turbulence/worldsheet thread is an even clearer example of a missing bridge: it proposes a scale-cascade ↔ RG/operator-mixing analogy, but lacks a controlled toy-model instantiation and discriminating observables that would separate it from generic nonequilibrium entanglement growth and scrambling in many-body systems.\n\nA second gap is definitional and terminological: “geometry,” “distance,” “connectivity,” “curvature,” “locality,” and even “entanglement” are used with different operational meanings across AdS/CFT, tensor networks, quantum information, analogue gravity, and LQG. In practice, different reconstruction pipelines implicitly target different objects—e.g., (i) a mutual-information graph (connectivity), (ii) correlator-decay-induced distances, (iii) curvature proxies inferred from entropy scaling, or (iv) RT/QECC-consistent metrics tied to extremal surfaces and correctability—and these are not automatically equivalent, especially for mixed states or finite-size devices. This ambiguity feeds directly into an evidence gap: many proposed “geometry reconstructions” can be reinterpreted as generic features of correlated quantum matter under decoherence, finite sampling, or measurement back-action unless the inference includes explicit nuisance models and uncertainty quantification. In other words, without noise-aware benchmarks (e.g., filter-function/noise spectroscopy layers alongside entanglement estimates), shifts in “inferred curvature” may simply reflect environment-induced reshaping of correlations rather than meaningful statements about an emergent gravitational dictionary.\n\nThe open questions that most constrain forward progress are therefore concrete and testable: Which entanglement measures (Rényi entropies, mutual information, entanglement spectrum, modular Hamiltonian data) are *necessary and sufficient* for reconstructing which geometric features, and with what stability bounds under perturbations? What dynamics preserve emergent locality (or destroy it) in experimentally realistic regimes—e.g., under dephasing, loss, finite temperature, or drive-induced heating—and how do these effects appear in operational signatures like mutual-information decay laws, minimal-cut proxies, or operator-reconstruction fidelity? How should “mixed-state geometry” be handled: are entanglement-of-purification–type quantities required, and can they be measured or reliably bounded in near-term platforms? Finally, what are minimal discriminating diagnostics that separate “holography-like” entanglement structure (code-like redundancy, entanglement spectrum fingerprints, predictable wedge reconstruction thresholds) from generic volume-law entanglement produced by chaotic circuits—especially when finite depth and noise can mimic or wash out those distinctions?\n\nNext-step research directions should be prioritized around tightening the translation layer and installing cross-source consistency checks. First, targeted reading in the *Handbook of Quantum Gravity* should be used explicitly as a bridge-building exercise: extract, side-by-side, the community-specific definitions of coarse-graining, continuum limits, and observables (e.g., RT/QES/modular flow in holography; renormalization and diffeomorphism-restoration criteria in spin foams; correlation-based signatures and systematics in analogue horizons), and record where they do and do not align. Second, expand the project’s “translation guide” into a living glossary plus mapping table that forces each claim to declare: (a) its operational geometry target (graph/distance/curvature/metric consistency), (b) its required observables (which entropies/correlators/reconstruction tasks), and (c) its regime assumptions (pure vs mixed, large‑N vs finite‑N, unitary vs open dynamics). Third, design a small suite of explicit benchmarks/CI-style checks for terminology and claims across sources: canonical toy states/circuits (MERA-like, random circuits, thermofield-double analogs) where mutual information, Rényi entropies, and reconstruction fidelity can all be computed; predetermined “expected relationships” (when they should agree, when they should diverge); and standardized reporting of uncertainty under controlled noise models. This combination—focused handbook-driven reading, a stricter translation layer, and reproducible benchmarks—directly targets the synthesis’s core bottleneck: moving from persuasive emergence narratives to operational, falsifiable correspondences that remain consistent across frameworks and resilient under realistic experimental and numerical conditions.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Lack of standardized, quantitative evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets for assessing coarse-graining / renormalization methods across cognitive scales.

The refreshed knowledge graph repeatedly links approaches that frame gravity/geometry as emergent—via entanglement, information flow, or effective field descriptions—to the same operational questions: *what degrees of freedom are being coarse-grained, what observables are preserved, and what fixed points or universality classes control the large-scale limit?* This framing adds value because it shifts comparison from rhetoric (“spacetime from information”) to **testable correspondences** (shared scaling laws, effective actions, and invariants under coarse-graining), enabling clearer cross-program benchmarking and reducing duplication of effort.\n\nThe current state of the synthesis emphasizes a **cross-community translation layer**: a deliberately minimal mapping that standardizes terms and metrics (e.g., coarse-graining map, preserved constraints, emergent geometry indicators) rather than forcing a grand unification. The main gap identified is a persistent mismatch between broad emergence narratives and **fully specified technical pipelines** that demonstrate the claim end-to-end across communities. Next-step directions therefore prioritize (1) explicit coarse-graining constructions that can be compared across frameworks, (2) shared diagnostic observables and minimal reproducible workflows, and (3) targeted case studies where different programs can be evaluated against the same RG-style criteria, clarifying which “emergence” claims are genuinely equivalent and which are merely analogies.\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & CURRENT STATE OF THE SYNTHESIS\n\n## Executive Summary & Current State of the Synthesis\n\nThis synthesis is being refreshed as an explicitly iterative process: each pass re-checks the knowledge graph for newly related nodes, revalidates prior claims against updated context, and then rewrites the high-level summary so that it remains consistent with the current evidence base rather than accumulating “stale” conclusions. Since the previous pass, the update cycle has already surfaced two additional related nodes, and the present revision is structured to fold those findings directly into the conceptual map (rather than appending them as disconnected addenda). Practically, this means the report is converging in controlled increments—each iteration (i) expands coverage where new links appear, (ii) tightens terminology where cross-community ambiguity was found, and (iii) refreshes the list of anchor references and deliverables that readers can use to reproduce or extend the benchmarks.\n\nA key change in the current pass is a strengthened unifying thread around renormalization-group (RG) and coarse-graining ideas as a cross-program “translation axis.” Recent special-issue framing (circa 2021; e.g., arXiv:2103.14605) is explicit that RG/coarse-graining is not merely a technical tool inside individual approaches, but a shared conceptual program: relate microscopic candidate degrees of freedom for spacetime (discrete, combinatorial, or field-theoretic) to emergent semiclassical behavior, effective dynamics, and ultimately phenomenology. This is being used in the synthesis as a practical alignment mechanism: when different communities use different language for emergence, continuum limits, universality, fixed points, or effective observables, the RG/coarse-graining framing provides a common set of “questions to ask” and consistency checks to apply across string/holography, loop/spinfoams, asymptotic safety, CDT, and effective/perturbative quantum gravity.\n\nIn parallel, the reference backbone for the synthesis has been updated to include an explicit multi-approach snapshot source: the Springer *Handbook of Quantum Gravity* (a living reference spanning 2020–2025; initially released 2023 with a major dated release in early Dec 2024). This matters for the current state because it provides a program-organized, comparatively current baseline for what each community takes as its canonical problems, methods, and benchmarks—reducing the risk that the synthesis overweights older review articles or idiosyncratic perspectives. In the report structure, the *Handbook* functions as the “major snapshot” anchor against which more specialized nodes (e.g., focused RG/coarse-graining discussions) can be cross-referenced, and it also helps identify where benchmark definitions diverge across subfields even when the underlying physical intent is similar.\n\nThe main concrete deliverables produced so far reflect this emphasis on cross-compatibility and reproducibility. Most notably, a concise translation guide (`translation_layer_v0_1.md`) has been drafted to map key terms and conventions across communities specifically insofar as needed to compute and compare benchmarks (e.g., RG/coarse-graining vocabulary, observable definitions, and normalization conventions). Alongside this conceptual infrastructure, the current workstream is also tracking implementation-oriented outputs—automated checks (pytest/CI-oriented) intended to validate schema conformance and ensure example benchmark computations reproduce expected outputs end-to-end. Taken together, these deliverables represent the “current state” of the synthesis: a progressively refreshed conceptual spine (RG/coarse-graining + canonical snapshots) coupled to tooling that supports repeatable benchmark evaluation as the knowledge graph continues to expand in subsequent passes.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CORE THEMATIC THREADS: COARSE-GRAINING, RENORMALIZATION, AND UNIFICATION FRAMINGS (2020–2025)\n\nAcross 2020–2025, the most persistent conceptual bridge—explicitly foregrounded in the 2021 special-issue framing (e.g., arXiv:2103.14605)—is the idea that *renormalization-group (RG) thinking and coarse-graining* provide a shared language for quantum-gravity research that otherwise appears methodologically fragmented. The unifying claim is twofold: (i) every viable approach must explain how microscopic “atoms of geometry” or fundamental degrees of freedom flow, under systematic coarse-graining, into the semiclassical regime described by general relativity plus quantum field theory; and (ii) the same flow should organize contact with phenomenology, by identifying which macroscopic observables are universal (insensitive to micro-details) versus which encode distinctive signatures. In this framing, “unification” is less about forcing a single formalism and more about establishing a common *pipeline*: define microscopic dynamics, define a coarse-graining map, compute effective theories, and diagnose fixed points/phases corresponding to continuum spacetime. This repositions disagreements between programs not only as competing kinematics or foundational postulates, but as differing choices of coarse-graining schemes, universality classes, and candidate continuum limits.\n\nSpin-foam loop quantum gravity provides a concrete example of how this thread reshaped priorities. Whereas earlier decades were dominated by kinematical constructions and model building, the 2018–2025 trajectory increasingly emphasizes *continuum recovery* through explicitly background-independent renormalization and coarse-graining. Techniques inspired by tensor networks and statistical mechanics are used to track how spin-foam amplitudes behave under refinement and blocking, with the diagnostic goal of identifying continuum phases and determining whether effective diffeomorphism symmetry—typically broken by discretization—can be restored in the infrared. This agenda implicitly reinterprets long-standing canonical LQG achievements (Ashtekar’s connection variables; early loop-representation constraint dynamics; the graviton/Fock-space connection; spin networks) as providing the microscopic and kinematical “UV data,” while the open problem becomes dynamical: showing that suitable coarse-grained limits reproduce familiar low-energy physics and that different discretizations flow to the same universality class rather than to inequivalent theories.\n\nWhat emerges as partial consensus is the *necessity* of RG structure—even when approaches disagree on what is being coarse-grained (graphs, foams, fields, entanglement structures) and how “scale” is defined without a background metric. Many communities converge on the idea that the continuum is best understood as a *phase* of an underlying system, characterized by fixed points, relevant/irrelevant deformations, and universal effective symmetries; coarse-graining is then not merely a computational tool but the conceptual mechanism by which “spacetime” becomes an emergent description. Divergences remain sharp, however, on (a) what counts as the correct notion of locality and scale in a background-independent setting; (b) whether diffeomorphism symmetry should be fundamental or only emergent; (c) which observables are trustworthy across the flow (e.g., relational observables versus boundary amplitudes); and (d) the degree to which different programs are expected to land in the same universality class. The 2020–2025 pattern is thus not a settled convergence to one framework, but a recognizable consolidation around RG/coarse-graining as the main *comparative interface*—a shared set of questions and benchmarks for relating micro-models to semiclassical spacetime, even when the candidate microphysics and technical implementations remain plural.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CROSS-COMMUNITY TRANSLATION LAYER & KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION WORKFLOW\n\n## Cross-Community Translation Layer & Knowledge Integration Workflow\n\nThe `translation_layer_v0_1` mapping is intentionally narrow: it does not attempt a grand unification of program-specific formalisms, but instead defines a *shared operational vocabulary* sufficient to compute and compare a minimal benchmark set. Its central alignment is the observation—explicitly shared across multiple quantum-gravity and gravity-adjacent communities—that **RG/coarse-graining** is the most reliable “bridge concept” linking microscopic models to emergent semiclassical behavior. In this layer, “RG flow,” “coarse-graining,” “continuum limit,” “fixed point,” and “universality” are treated as translation anchors rather than as theory-specific technical constructs: regardless of whether a community speaks in terms of tuning to a critical surface (traditional Symanzik viewpoint), learned/adaptive multiscale representations (data-driven RG), or rigorous global-fit benchmarking practice, the common target is the same—**extracting continuum (and infinite-volume) physics from regulated calculations with controlled, quantified systematics**. The translation layer therefore standardizes how we *name* and *scope* those claims (e.g., what counts as “continuum recovery” vs. “representation change”) without asserting unavailable details such as beta functions, partition-function normalizations, or amplitude conventions.\n\nA second pillar of `translation_layer_v0_1` is the alignment of **observable classes** across communities at the level of *measurable outputs* rather than formal dictionaries. The mapping highlights three observable families that recur in the accumulated notes and are suitable for benchmark computation with minimal cross-program commitments: (i) **Hawking-like emission and correlations** in analogue/phenomenology-adjacent settings, with explicit emphasis on systematics and backreaction; (ii) **causal-set QFT observables** such as entanglement entropy and in-in correlators/scattering quantities; and (iii) **decoherence/noise observables** including decoherence rates/spectra, their scaling with gravitational potential differences, and noise power spectral density outputs compatible with filter-function analysis. Critically, the translation layer treats these as *interfaces*: it specifies what each community must output (e.g., a correlator estimate with defined uncertainty bookkeeping; a noise spectrum over a stated frequency band; an entanglement proxy under an explicit regulator), while explicitly refusing to invent shared normalizations that are not present in the knowledge base. This “operational interface” approach supports integration because it allows disparate sources to be compared through **common reporting contracts**—units, domain/range, and uncertainty structure—rather than requiring agreement on deep formal equivalences.\n\nTo make this translation layer actionable, we propose an iterative synthesis workflow organized as repeated passes of **node discovery → mapping → reconciliation → updated summary**. *Node discovery* searches new notes, papers, code outputs, and agent artifacts for candidate concepts (e.g., a newly recurring definition of “continuum limit,” or a new observable family that can serve as a benchmark). *Mapping* then attempts to place each node into the translation layer: either as an alias of an existing anchor term (e.g., “block-spin transformation” ↔ “coarse-graining step”), as a refinement (adding constraints to an existing definition), or as a new interface requirement (a new output schema field for an observable). *Reconciliation* addresses tensions already visible in the synthesis record—most notably the methodological split between Symanzik-style extrapolation and learned multiscale bases—by making disagreement explicit at the contract level: what diagnostics and validation must be reported so that different strategies can still be compared on equal footing (e.g., cross-validation and stability checks for learned methods alongside correlated global fits and power-counting-motivated terms for Symanzik extrapolation). Finally, each pass produces an *updated summary* that is not merely narrative, but also updates the translation layer document itself (definitions, allowed synonyms, required metadata, and “out-of-scope” boundaries) so future comparisons become easier rather than harder.\n\nStructured outputs and benchmarks from code-creation agent introspection artifacts should be incorporated as first-class inputs to this loop, not as after-the-fact appendices. Practically, each introspection artifact (prompts, stage logs, schema drafts, benchmark outputs) is treated as a discoverable node with provenance, and its key contributions are harvested into: (a) **benchmark contracts** (explicit schemas for inputs/outputs, hashing/serialization, tolerance policies), and (b) **reconciliation evidence** (what failed, what was ambiguous, what required additional conventions). This directly supports the report’s broader reproducibility emphasis: benchmarks become end-to-end artifacts with deterministic I/O and reference outputs, while the translation layer becomes the semantic “glue” that ensures those benchmarks remain comparable across communities even when internal representations differ. Over successive passes, this workflow yields a controlled expansion of shared vocabulary and interfaces—anchored in RG/coarse-graining and operational observables—while preserving a hard boundary against ungrounded normalization claims that the current knowledge base does not support.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## GAPS, OPEN QUESTIONS, AND NEXT-STEP RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n\n## Gaps, Open Questions, and Next-Step Research Directions\n\nA central gap exposed by the synthesis is the persistent mismatch between *coarse-graining narratives* (“geometry emerges from entanglement/information flow”) and *specific technical frameworks* that make this claim precise across communities. In holography, the entanglement→geometry link is sharpest in idealized settings (large‑N CFTs with semiclassical AdS duals) via Ryu–Takayanagi and entanglement-wedge reconstruction, but the report repeatedly runs into under-specified translations when moving to regimes that matter for laboratory proxies and broader quantum-gravity programs: mixed states, finite temperature, time dependence, finite‑N, and noisy dynamics. Meanwhile, in spin-foam/LQG the most concrete progress is formulated in terms of coarse-graining/renormalization and continuum recovery (including tensor-network-inspired methods to restore effective diffeomorphism symmetry), but the *dictionary* that would align LQG “continuum limit indicators” with holographic “entanglement/RT indicators” remains mostly rhetorical rather than operational. The turbulence/worldsheet thread is an even clearer example of a missing bridge: it proposes a scale-cascade ↔ RG/operator-mixing analogy, but lacks a controlled toy-model instantiation and discriminating observables that would separate it from generic nonequilibrium entanglement growth and scrambling in many-body systems.\n\nA second gap is definitional and terminological: “geometry,” “distance,” “connectivity,” “curvature,” “locality,” and even “entanglement” are used with different operational meanings across AdS/CFT, tensor networks, quantum information, analogue gravity, and LQG. In practice, different reconstruction pipelines implicitly target different objects—e.g., (i) a mutual-information graph (connectivity), (ii) correlator-decay-induced distances, (iii) curvature proxies inferred from entropy scaling, or (iv) RT/QECC-consistent metrics tied to extremal surfaces and correctability—and these are not automatically equivalent, especially for mixed states or finite-size devices. This ambiguity feeds directly into an evidence gap: many proposed “geometry reconstructions” can be reinterpreted as generic features of correlated quantum matter under decoherence, finite sampling, or measurement back-action unless the inference includes explicit nuisance models and uncertainty quantification. In other words, without noise-aware benchmarks (e.g., filter-function/noise spectroscopy layers alongside entanglement estimates), shifts in “inferred curvature” may simply reflect environment-induced reshaping of correlations rather than meaningful statements about an emergent gravitational dictionary.\n\nThe open questions that most constrain forward progress are therefore concrete and testable: Which entanglement measures (Rényi entropies, mutual information, entanglement spectrum, modular Hamiltonian data) are *necessary and sufficient* for reconstructing which geometric features, and with what stability bounds under perturbations? What dynamics preserve emergent locality (or destroy it) in experimentally realistic regimes—e.g., under dephasing, loss, finite temperature, or drive-induced heating—and how do these effects appear in operational signatures like mutual-information decay laws, minimal-cut proxies, or operator-reconstruction fidelity? How should “mixed-state geometry” be handled: are entanglement-of-purification–type quantities required, and can they be measured or reliably bounded in near-term platforms? Finally, what are minimal discriminating diagnostics that separate “holography-like” entanglement structure (code-like redundancy, entanglement spectrum fingerprints, predictable wedge reconstruction thresholds) from generic volume-law entanglement produced by chaotic circuits—especially when finite depth and noise can mimic or wash out those distinctions?\n\nNext-step research directions should be prioritized around tightening the translation layer and installing cross-source consistency checks. First, targeted reading in the *Handbook of Quantum Gravity* should be used explicitly as a bridge-building exercise: extract, side-by-side, the community-specific definitions of coarse-graining, continuum limits, and observables (e.g., RT/QES/modular flow in holography; renormalization and diffeomorphism-restoration criteria in spin foams; correlation-based signatures and systematics in analogue horizons), and record where they do and do not align. Second, expand the project’s “translation guide” into a living glossary plus mapping table that forces each claim to declare: (a) its operational geometry target (graph/distance/curvature/metric consistency), (b) its required observables (which entropies/correlators/reconstruction tasks), and (c) its regime assumptions (pure vs mixed, large‑N vs finite‑N, unitary vs open dynamics). Third, design a small suite of explicit benchmarks/CI-style checks for terminology and claims across sources: canonical toy states/circuits (MERA-like, random circuits, thermofield-double analogs) where mutual information, Rényi entropies, and reconstruction fidelity can all be computed; predetermined “expected relationships” (when they should agree, when they should diverge); and standardized reporting of uncertainty under controlled noise models. This combination—focused handbook-driven reading, a stricter translation layer, and reproducible benchmarks—directly targets the synthesis’s core bottleneck: moving from persuasive emergence narratives to operational, falsifiable correspondences that remain consistent across frameworks and resilient under realistic experimental and numerical conditions.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Lack of standardized, quantitative evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets for assessing coarse-graining / renormalization methods across cognitive scales.

The central finding is that nearly every program already contains an “RG story,” but it is expressed through different **fundamental variables** and therefore different meanings of **scale** (e.g., worldsheet/moduli vs. target‑space energy; lattice/graph refinement vs. continuum momentum shells; tensor‑network depth vs. geometric length). Framing each approach by (i) its coarse‑graining operation, (ii) its assumptions about microscopic degrees of freedom, and (iii) the characteristic scales at which semiclassical gravity should emerge yields a common template to catalog **results, robustness, and open problems**—especially around fixed points/continuum limits, universality, and the reproduction of effective field theory and semiclassical general relativity.\n\nTo make the comparison operational, the report recommends building a **translation layer**: a minimal shared glossary and notation guide that maps each program’s RG objects (flows, couplings, effective actions/states, truncations, observables) onto common technical structures and defines cross‑checks that can be stated program‑independently. Finally, it outlines a governance and recruitment model for a credible living document: **program‑balanced editorial stewardship**, explicit contributor roles (program leads, translation editors, and cross‑check reviewers), and a lightweight update workflow that enforces neutrality, traceable claims, and periodic synthesis releases. The value is a durable, searchable resource that reduces conceptual friction between communities while sharpening the shared question: **which coarse‑graining mechanisms reliably produce the observed semiclassical regime, and under what assumptions and scales do they succeed or fail?**\n\n---\n\n## 1) UNIFYING FRAME: RENORMALIZATION/COARSE‑GRAINING AS THE COMMON LANGUAGE\n\nRenormalization and coarse‑graining provide a deliberately program‑agnostic way to state the shared problem that every quantum‑gravity approach faces: how a candidate microscopic description (discrete, algebraic, or continuum but nonperturbative) yields the observed semiclassical regime of general relativity plus quantum matter, with controlled approximations and falsifiable consequences. Framed this way, the cross‑program review and living wiki are not organized by historical schools, preferred ontologies, or “fundamental” variables, but by the flow from micro to macro: what is being averaged/blocked/integrated out, what notion of “scale” is used, which structures must survive coarse‑graining (local Lorentz invariance, diffeomorphism symmetry, unitarity/causality), and what counts as evidence that a continuum limit has been reached. This framing is now explicitly advocated as a unifying conceptual and technical thread across quantum‑gravity programs (e.g., the 2021 special‑issue perspective around RG/coarse‑graining as the bridge between microscopic models and emergent semiclassical behavior; see arXiv:2103.14605). It also naturally accommodates “top‑down” approaches (where the UV theory is formulated first and the IR must be recovered) and “bottom‑up/analogue” approaches (where effective gravitational dynamics and phenomenology emerge in laboratory or condensed‑matter settings), without forcing premature equivalences.\n\nTo make comparisons precise, the document standardizes a small set of axes that every entry must address. **(i) Degrees of freedom (DoF):** what are the microscopic variables (connections/holonomies and fluxes; spin networks; spin foams; tensors; group‑field quanta; lattice geometries; effective quasiparticles in analog systems), and what is their state space. Canonical LQG, for example, is anchored by Ashtekar’s connection variables and loop/spin‑network kinematics (Ashtekar 1986, DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.57.2244; Rovelli–Smolin 1990; Ashtekar–Rovelli–Smolin 1992; Rovelli–Smolin 1995), while contemporary spin‑foam LQG increasingly treats dynamics/continuum recovery as the central question. **(ii) Notion of scale:** is “scale” a length, an energy, a graph refinement level, a representation label, a tensor‑network depth, a causal set density, or an operational resolution tied to observables. **(iii) Coarse‑graining map:** what is the RG transformation (blocking, decimation, integrating out amplitudes, tensor network renormalization, functional RG flow, ensemble averaging), and what is held fixed (symmetries, boundary data, coupling definitions). In spin‑foam models (2018–2025 trend), background‑independent renormalization/coarse‑graining—including tensor‑network‑inspired algorithms—has become a primary tool for diagnosing continuum limits and for tracking the restoration of effective diffeomorphism symmetry that is typically broken by discretization at intermediate steps. **(iv) Fixed points/continuum limits:** what is meant by a UV completion or a continuum phase (critical surfaces, universality classes, second‑order transitions, perfect actions), and how one recognizes emergent GR. **(v) Observables:** what quantities are compared along the flow (correlation functions, spectral/hausdorff dimension, effective action couplings, entanglement measures, scattering/propagators, horizon thermodynamics). **(vi) Validation strategy:** what checks are internal (consistency, anomaly freedom, symmetry restoration, universality/robustness) versus external (phenomenology, cosmology, analog‑gravity experiments). Here, “analogue” and emergent‑gravity platforms illustrate what “validation” can mean when gravity is not fundamental: e.g., BEC analogue black holes probing Hawking‑like radiation through particle–partner correlations and entanglement signatures, and Weyl semimetal transport interpreted via gravitational/thermal anomalies—both serving as testbeds for coarse‑grained horizon physics and effective field theory assumptions, while also highlighting systematics and interpretational ambiguities.\n\nThe wiki therefore adopts a **minimal shared notation** that keeps each program’s native language intact but makes translation explicit. Each model is summarized by a tuple \\((\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{R}, \\{g_i\\}, \\mathcal{O})\\): microscopic DoF \\(\\mathcal{D}\\); state space/measure or amplitude definition \\(\\mathcal{S}\\); coarse‑graining/RG map \\(\\mathcal{R}_b:\\mathcal{S}\\!\\to\\!\\mathcal{S}'\\) parameterized by a blocking factor \\(b\\) (or an alternative scale parameter \\(k\\)); effective couplings \\(\\{g_i(k)\\}\\) or effective amplitudes; and a chosen set of observables \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) used to define “same physics” across scales. Where conventional beta functions exist, we write \\(\\beta_i=\\mathrm{d}g_i/\\mathrm{d}\\ln k\\); where they do not (common in background‑independent/discrete settings), we require an explicit statement of the flow parameter (refinement depth, coarse boundary graphs, truncation order) and the projection used to compare theories at different “resolutions.” Each page must also specify which symmetries are exact, which are emergent, and which are monitored as diagnostics (e.g., Ward identities or discrete analogues), since symmetry restoration is often the operational signature of a viable continuum regime in discretized quantum‑gravity dynamics.\n\nFinally, the section sets **standards for neutrality, evidence, and citations** to keep the cross‑program comparison constructive and updateable. “Neutrality” means the organizing categories are RG/coarse‑graining features rather than claims of fundamentality; every comparison must be stated in terms of the axes above and tied to concrete constructions (a defined coarse‑graining move, a computed flow, a demonstrated universality result, or a clearly described negative result). “Evidence” is tagged by type—formal (theorem/derivation), numerical (finite‑size scaling, tensor‑network truncations, Monte Carlo), phenomenological (constraints/forecasts), or experimental/analog—and each tag carries a required level of methodological detail (e.g., truncation scheme, convergence tests, error budgets, competing interpretations). Citations must distinguish primary sources from reviews and must record versioned identifiers (DOI/arXiv) and, for computational results, reproducibility hooks (code/data links when available). This structure is intended to make the living wiki a translation layer: it does not declare winners, but it makes clear where different programs are genuinely commensurable (shared coarse‑graining logic, shared universality targets) and where they diverge (in their definition of scale, their admissible coarse‑graining maps, and their criteria for having reached a continuum, semiclassical phase).\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 2) PROGRAM-BY-PROGRAM RG MAP (METHODS, ASSUMPTIONS, SCALES, RESULTS, OPEN PROBLEMS)\n\n## 2) Program-by-Program RG Map (Methods, Assumptions, Scales, Results, Open Problems)\n\nAcross quantum-gravity programs, “RG” and “coarse graining” appear in program-specific guises because the *fundamental variables* and hence the *meaning of scale* differ: worldsheet/moduli and target-space energies in string theory; graph refinement, spins, and boundary data in LQG/spin foams; lattice spacing and diffusion time in CDT; order-theoretic density in causal sets; momentum/derivative scales in functional RG for asymptotic safety; and representation cutoffs/tensor ranks in group field theory (GFT). A useful unifying lens is that each program seeks a continuum macroscopic regime where (i) effective locality and approximate diffeomorphism invariance emerge (or become exact), and (ii) long-distance observables become insensitive to UV details. The differences lie in what is held fixed while coarse graining (e.g., topology, causal structure, combinatorics), what counts as “integrating out” degrees of freedom (short strings, fine graph edges, small simplices, high spins, high tensor modes), and how fixed points/phase transitions are diagnosed (CFTs on the worldsheet, FRG non-Gaussian fixed points, tensor-network fixed points, lattice critical points, or universality of spectral dimension flow). Below we map each program to its characteristic variables, scale notions, practical RG schemes, and the main current “continuum-limit” bottlenecks.\n\n**String theory (incl. holography and swampland):** Fundamental variables depend on formulation: worldsheet fields with target-space background data (perturbative), D-branes/open strings and gauge theories (nonperturbative via dualities), and bulk fields in AdS/CFT where the *dual QFT RG scale* serves as a precise notion of “radial” bulk scale. Coarse graining is often realized as (a) worldsheet RG flows between 2D CFTs (beta functions ↔ spacetime equations of motion at lowest order), and (b) boundary Wilsonian RG or holographic renormalization in AdS/CFT (Hamilton–Jacobi/Fefferman–Graham expansions; multi-trace deformations; entanglement wedge reconstruction as a kind of scale-dependent encoding). Truncations are typically large‑N, large ’t Hooft coupling, supergravity limits, or consistent Kaluza–Klein truncations; in cosmology, EFT truncations with controlled towers (distance conjecture) are central. “Fixed points” appear as conformal fixed points (exact CFTs) or as strongly coupled CFTs dual to semiclassical AdS; phase structure includes confinement/deconfinement and holographic RG flows between CFTs. Successes: sharp nonperturbative definitions in backgrounds with known duals, quantitative control of quantum corrections in protected sectors, and a systematic constraint program (swampland) that functions as a meta‑RG consistency filter on low-energy EFTs. Open problems: extending beyond AdS (realistic cosmology, dS), making RG/scale notions intrinsic when no dual QFT is known, and clarifying how swampland constraints interplay with coarse graining (e.g., whether certain EFT “flows” are obstructed by emergent towers). *Core references/reviews:* Polchinski (string theory); Becker–Becker–Schwarz (string/M theory); Henningson–Skenderis and de Boer–Verlinde–Verlinde (holographic renormalization/RG); Aharony et al. (AdS/CFT review); Heemskerk–Polchinski and Faulkner–Liu–Rangamani (Wilsonian/holographic RG); Palti (swampland review), van Beest–Caldwell–Palti (modern swampland overviews).\n\n**Loop quantum gravity & spin foams:** Kinematics uses holonomies and fluxes (Ashtekar–Barbero variables), spin networks on graphs (SU(2) reps on links, intertwiners at nodes), and covariant spin-foam amplitudes as a sum over labeled 2‑complexes (EPRL/FK-type models). “Scale” is not a background momentum but is encoded in *graph refinement* (combinatorial resolution), *spin labels* (area/volume quanta), boundary state coarse graining, and sometimes *diffusion time* via spectral probes. Coarse graining is pursued through (i) refinement/decimation moves on 2‑complexes (Pachner-move-inspired), (ii) tensor-network renormalization of spin-foam amplitudes (viewing local amplitudes as tensors and iterating blocking), and (iii) group-theoretic RG ideas tracking how effective amplitudes change under integrating out internal spins/foams. Typical approximations include fixed 2‑complex truncations, large-spin (semiclassical) asymptotics, restriction to simplified boundary graphs, and “cylindrical consistency” assumptions in inductive limits. Phase structure is less settled than in lattice models, but there is increasing emphasis (2018–2025 trend) on diagnosing continuum limits and the restoration of *effective diffeomorphism symmetry* through coarse graining, with fixed points expected to encode topological/BF-like phases versus geometric phases. Successes: robust kinematical quantum geometry, controlled semiclassical limits for amplitudes in certain regimes, and rapidly maturing background-independent coarse-graining toolkits (notably tensor-network-inspired). Open problems: establishing a demonstrable continuum limit with the correct graviton/long-distance dynamics, clarifying universality classes across different foam discretizations, and connecting coarse-grained observables to low-energy EFT parameters. *Core references/reviews:* Rovelli (LQG); Thiemann (modern canonical LQG); Perez (spin-foam review); Engle (EPRL and developments); Bahr–Dittrich (coarse graining and diffeo symmetry ideas); recent spin-foam/tensor-network coarse graining reviews and topical special-issue editorials (2019–2025).\n\n**CDT (causal dynamical triangulations) and causal sets:** CDT’s fundamental variables are Lorentzian triangulations built from simplices with fixed edge lengths and a preferred foliation/causal structure; the scale is the lattice spacing (set by simplex edge length), system size (number of simplices), and *diffusion time* used to define the running spectral dimension. RG/coarse graining is implemented via Monte Carlo exploration of phase diagrams and finite-size scaling near critical lines; practical “RG” is extracted by identifying second-order transitions suitable for continuum limits and by tracking how effective actions and observables change under changes in bare couplings and lattice parameters. Truncations are intrinsic: fixed simplex types, fixed topology choices, and finite volumes; the hope is universality renders details irrelevant at criticality. Known results include a rich phase structure (multiple phases separated by transition lines) and robust evidence for scale-dependent spectral dimension (flowing toward ~2 at short diffusion times in several studies), plus emergence of extended 4D-like geometries in an appropriate phase. Open problems: constructing explicit coarse-graining transformations on triangulations (beyond indirect scaling analyses), matching continuum EFT couplings, and clarifying the relation of CDT critical points to asymptotic safety scenarios. Causal sets instead take a locally finite partially ordered set as fundamental; scale is set by the sprinkling density (discreteness scale) and coarse graining by *thinning* (random deletion) or sequential growth dynamics. Renormalization is less standardized: one studies how order-invariant observables and effective dynamics change under changes in density, and uses diffusion/spectral estimators and dimension measures as scale probes. Successes include a clean kinematical encoding of causality and Lorentz invariance (via Poisson sprinkling) and sharp statements about nonlocal operators; open problems center on producing realistic continuum dynamics, a systematic RG (fixed points/universality classes), and identifying observables that robustly reproduce GR in the macroscopic limit. *Core references/reviews:* Ambjørn–Jurkiewicz–Loll (CDT reviews); Loll (intro CDT); Bombelli–Sorkin and Surya (causal set reviews); Benincasa–Dowker (causal set d’Alembertian and dynamics); recent CDT phase-structure papers and causal-set phenomenology reviews.\n\n**Asymptotic safety and group field theory (GFT):** Asymptotic safety uses the metric (or tetrad/connection) as fundamental variables in a continuum QFT framework, with the *RG scale* a momentum/derivative scale \\(k\\) defined via a regulator in the functional RG (Wetterich equation). Coarse graining is explicitly Wilsonian: integrate out momentum shells to obtain a scale-dependent effective average action \\(\\Gamma_k\\). Truncations are central and systematic but approximate: Einstein–Hilbert truncations, \\(f(R)\\) and higher-derivative operators, inclusion of matter, bimetric and background-field split structures, and varying gauge/parameterization choices; reliability is assessed by stability under truncation enlargement and by scheme dependence checks. The key result is strong evidence (across many truncations) for a *non-Gaussian UV fixed point* with a finite number of relevant directions, plus rich IR behavior potentially matching classical GR with small quantum corrections; ongoing work refines matter couplings and addresses background independence. Open problems: fully controlling truncation/systematic errors, clarifying the physical meaning of “RG time” in a background-independent setting, and deriving robust, gauge-independent observable predictions (e.g., cosmological imprints). GFT formulates quantum gravity as a QFT on group manifolds, with fields \\(\\varphi(g_1,\\dots,g_d)\\) whose quanta correspond to spin-network nodes/simplicial building blocks; scale can be a representation/spin cutoff, tensor-rank refinements, or FRG momentum-like scales on the group. RG is pursued via FRG adapted to tensorial/group field theories and via tensor-model universality: one studies flows of interaction kernels (simplicial combinatorics) and searches for fixed points and phase transitions associated with condensate (continuum/geometry) phases. Truncations include polynomial interaction truncations, restriction to specific invariants (“melonic” dominance in certain regimes), and simplified kinetic terms; successes include a coherent RG language linking spin foams/tensor models and evidence for nontrivial fixed points and candidate geometric/condensate phases. Open problems: establishing a clear dictionary from GFT RG fixed points to continuum gravitational EFTs, controlling nonperturbative phases beyond leading tensor universality classes, and connecting to phenomenology. *Core references/reviews:* Reuter (foundational asymptotic safety); Percacci (asymptotic safety textbook/review); Niedermaier–Reuter (review); Eichhorn (modern FRG/asymptotic safety reviews); Rivasseau (tensor models); Oriti (GFT reviews and condensates); Carrozza (tensorial GFT renormalization); recent FRG-in-GFT papers and reviews (2018–2025).\n\n**Cross-program relationships and shared RG diagnostics:** Several bridges are now concrete enough to guide a “living RG map.” (1) *Spectral dimension and diffusion probes* provide a common, largely kinematics-agnostic observable used in CDT, some spin-foam/GFT contexts, and occasionally in effective/FRG analyses; agreement or disagreement of dimension flow becomes a comparative diagnostic. (2) *Tensor-network and tensor-model methods* increasingly unify spin-foam coarse graining with GFT/tensorial QFT renormalization, suggesting shared fixed-point structures and universality notions even when microscopic interpretations differ. (3) *Phase diagrams and continuum limits* are the common strategic target: CDT seeks second-order transitions; asymptotic safety seeks UV fixed points; spin foams/GFT seek coarse-graining fixed points restoring diffeomorphism symmetry and yielding geometric phases; string theory seeks consistent UV completions often characterized by CFT fixed points/holographic RG flows, with swampland constraints acting as consistency conditions on admissible EFT trajectories. The major open, cross-cutting problem is a *translation layer* from each program’s “scale” to others’—e.g., relating spin cutoffs/graph refinement to FRG momentum scales or to holographic radial scales—together with benchmark observables (two-point functions, universal critical exponents, anomaly coefficients, entanglement scalings) that can be computed in multiple frameworks and compared in shared RG language.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 3) TRANSLATION LAYER: SHARED GLOSSARY, CONCEPT MAPPING, AND CROSS-CHECKS\n\n### 3) Translation Layer: Shared Glossary, Concept Mapping, and Cross-Checks\n\nA practical “translation layer” is necessary because most quantum-gravity programs *do* share a coarse-graining/renormalization narrative (explicitly emphasized in cross-community framings around RG as a unifying thread), but they encode it in different objects (actions vs. transfer matrices vs. amplitudes vs. discrete growth dynamics) and—crucially—attach different meanings to the same words (“continuum limit,” “observable,” “background independence”). For COSMO’s benchmark-oriented workflow, the goal is not to force a single formalism, but to provide a minimal shared glossary that pins each term to (i) *what is being coarse-grained*, (ii) *what is held fixed vs. tuned*, (iii) *what data product is compared* (e.g., correlators, entanglement measures, spectral dimension), and (iv) which scheme/regularization choices are “gauge-like” ambiguities that must be tracked as metadata. This also aligns with the scope constraint already adopted in the existing translation guide: map terms only insofar as needed to compute and cross-check benchmark observables (rather than inventing full normalization dictionaries that are not yet supported by the current knowledge base).\n\n**First-pass shared glossary (concept → how it appears across programs; notation is indicative and should be treated as a living mapping).** (1) **Coarse-graining operator / RG step**: FRG communities implement a scale-dependent suppression of modes via a regulator (often discussed as integrating out fluctuations above/below a scale), while lattice/DT/CDT implement blocking moves or change of triangulation resolution; spin-foam/GFT renormalization talks about coarse-graining *amplitudes* or group-field interaction kernels; tensor-network approaches treat coarse-graining as an explicit isometry/disentangler circuit; causal sets typically phrase it as thinning/sprinkling density changes or decimation of elements. (2) **Effective action**: FRG uses a scale-dependent effective action (the “running” generator of 1PI correlators); spin-foam/GFT analogues may be an effective group-field action after integrating degrees of freedom; lattice approaches often use an effective action inferred from ensembles/transfer matrices; holography uses a boundary generating functional tied to bulk dynamics; analogue-gravity and decoherence communities instead emphasize effective open-system dynamics (master equations, noise kernels) as the “effective description.” (3) **Continuum limit**: on the lattice it is a critical/large-correlation-length limit as discretization scale → 0; in FRG it is a UV completion (often framed as approaching a fixed point); in spin foams/GFT it is the emergence of a continuum geometry from many building blocks; in causal sets it is recovery of Lorentzian manifold behavior in suitable large-number-density limits; in analogue gravity it is not “fundamental continuum” but the regime where emergent field modes reproduce QFT-in-curved-spacetime predictions within controlled systematics. (4) **Universality**: FRG/lattice emphasize regulator/discretization independence of long-distance observables (critical exponents, scaling functions); tensor networks phrase it as insensitivity to microscopic circuit details given the same fixed-point tensor; causal sets seek universality of continuum observables under different microscopic dynamics; in phenomenology/analogue settings it means robustness of signatures under experimental imperfections and backreaction modeling. (5) **Fixed point**: FRG speaks directly of RG fixed points controlling UV/IR behavior; lattice/DT/CDT identify critical points/lines in bare-coupling space; tensor networks identify fixed-point tensors; spin-foam/GFT look for fixed points of coarse-graining flows of amplitudes/couplings; holography ties fixed points to CFTs (and deformations as flows). (6) **Truncation scheme**: FRG uses explicit truncations of the effective action (operator basis cutoffs); spin-foam/GFT truncate interaction terms/representation content or restrict foam complexes; lattice simulations truncate by finite volume, finite lattice spacing, and restricted move sets; tensor networks truncate bond dimension; causal sets truncate by finite element number and finite sampling; analogue/decoherence truncate environment models and noise spectra parametrizations (often controlled via filter-function analyses). (7) **Phase transition / order parameter**: in lattice/DT/CDT, phases of geometry are identified by scaling properties and order parameters (e.g., volume profile/transfer-matrix indicators); FRG identifies transitions via flows and relevant directions; spin-foam/GFT sometimes uses condensate order parameters (where applicable) or observables diagnosing geometric phases; tensor networks use entanglement patterns as phase diagnostics; causal sets may use order parameters tied to locality/dimension estimators; analogue systems treat horizon formation and emission correlations as “order-parameter-like” diagnostics but must separate them from mundane systematics. (8) **Running couplings**: FRG explicitly computes scale-dependent couplings; lattice infers effective couplings from ensemble behavior; spin-foam/GFT defines running couplings in the effective group-field description; tensor networks encode running in scale-dependent tensors; holography encodes running via radial evolution/renormalization; in decoherence/phenomenology the “running” analogue often appears as scale-dependent noise spectra or effective parameters inferred across experimental bandwidths. (9) **Background-(in)dependence**: FRG has both background-field implementations and ongoing work toward background-independent observables; lattice/DT/CDT aim for geometric dynamics without a fixed metric background but still require a choice of ensemble and foliation constraints (program-dependent); spin foams/GFT are typically framed as background-independent at the kinematical level but require choices of boundary data/embedding interpretation; causal sets are background-free but must recover continuum symmetries statistically; analogue gravity is explicitly *background-dependent* (a laboratory medium), used as a controlled proxy for kinematics/dynamics of fields on effective geometries. (10) **Observables**: across programs, the translation layer should privilege observables that can be computed in multiple formalisms—e.g., **(i)** two-point functions/“graviton proxy” correlators (where defined), **(ii)** spectral/heat-kernel dimension as a scale-dependent diagnostic, **(iii)** entanglement entropy or mutual information (explicitly highlighted in causal-set QFT contexts, and also natural in holography/tensor networks), **(iv)** scattering/in-in correlators (noted for causal sets), and **(v)** decoherence rates/noise spectral densities with filter-function outputs (explicitly part of the decoherence benchmark framing). The key semantic cross-check is: *what is operationally measurable vs. purely formal,* and *how much gauge/scheme dependence remains* after specifying the observable.\n\nCommon technical tools provide the “bridges” that make these translations actionable rather than rhetorical. On the RG side this includes functional RG equations (FRG), large‑N expansions in settings where they apply (notably in holography-adjacent analyses), and systematic truncation/error estimation. On the discrete/numerical side, lattice/DT/CDT methods, Monte Carlo sampling, and transfer-matrix/finite-size scaling techniques supply controlled extrapolations toward continuum behavior. Tensor-network renormalization offers an explicitly constructive coarse-graining map (and a natural interface to entanglement-based diagnostics). Heat-kernel/spectral-dimension estimators form a widely portable diagnostic because they can be computed on discrete ensembles, effective field theories, or reconstructed geometries. Finally, the analogue-gravity and decoherence threads contribute a different kind of toolchain: end-to-end systematics modeling (including backreaction where relevant), plus noise-spectrum and filter-function analyses that turn “environmental coupling” into reproducible, comparable metrics.\n\nTo keep cross-program comparisons honest, COSMO should adopt **sanity checks and benchmark comparisons** that are deliberately redundant across methods and explicitly track scheme dependence. Minimal cross-checks include: (i) **spectral dimension vs. scale** computed in at least one discrete approach (DT/CDT/spin-foam/GFT ensemble or causal set) and one continuum/RG-motivated effective description, checking qualitative flow and identifying which features are regulator/discretization artifacts; (ii) **finite-size / finite-resolution scaling** comparisons (lattice spacing ↔ FRG cutoff scale ↔ tensor-network layer depth ↔ causal-set density), with a shared metadata schema recording what is tuned and what is held fixed; (iii) **two-point/correlation-function consistency** where each program has a well-defined analogue (even if only a “proxy”), accompanied by a translation note clarifying what degrees of freedom the correlator refers to; (iv) **entanglement-based diagnostics** computed in causal-set QFT (explicitly in scope) and, where available, matched to tensor-network/holographic expectations at the level of scaling behavior rather than absolute normalization; and (v) for laboratory-facing benchmarks, **systematics vs. signal separation**: reproduce Hawking-like emission/correlation analyses under controlled model variations and compare with decoherence-style noise/filter-function outputs to ensure that “RG-like running” inferred from data is not just an artefact of instrumentation or environmental modeling. The operational outcome is a living translation table (terms + semantics + required metadata) paired with a small set of benchmark plots whose *agreement/disagreement patterns* are interpretable across communities without collapsing real conceptual differences.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 4) LIVING WIKI IMPLEMENTATION: CONTRIBUTORS, GOVERNANCE, AND UPDATE WORKFLOW\n\n## 4) Living Wiki Implementation: Contributors, Governance, and Update Workflow\n\nA credible “living wiki” for cross-program quantum gravity must be staffed and governed as a **balanced, translation-first editorial project**, not as a loosely moderated notes dump. We recommend recruiting **program lead editors** (one per program) empowered to curate scope and canonical references for their community, paired with **cross-program technical editors** responsible for enforcing the shared RG/coarse-graining translation layer (definitions of coarse-graining maps, continuum limits, universality/fixed points, scale notions in background-independent settings, and reporting contracts for benchmark observables). Each program team should include (i) **reviewers** (senior domain experts who sign off on “stable releases”), and (ii) **junior contributors** (postdocs/PhD students) who do the primary drafting, figure recreation, and reference audits under guidance. The minimal balanced set of programs for governance purposes is: **String theory & holography**, **Loop quantum gravity & spin foams (incl. GFT/tensor-network coarse-graining)**, **Asymptotic safety / functional RG**, **Causal dynamical triangulations & lattice/discrete gravity**, and **Effective/perturbative quantum gravity & phenomenology interfaces** (including “benchmark observables” like ringdown/echo parameterizations, Hawking-flux deviations, and information-theoretic diagnostics where applicable). To prevent dominance by any one community, steering votes should be **one-program–one-vote** on scope changes and release blocking, with technical editors holding veto power only on **format/verification compliance** (citations, schema, reproducibility), not on scientific interpretation.\n\nNeutrality and conflict-of-interest rules should be explicit and operational. Every page should carry a “**status tag**” (Draft / Reviewed / Stable / Deprecated) and a “**positioning box**” that separates (a) consensus statements, (b) active controversies, and (c) speculative proposals, with claims linked to sources and (where feasible) benchmark outputs. Contributors must file a lightweight **COI disclosure** (e.g., “author of cited work,” “collaborator,” “competing model”) at the page or section level; COIs do not disqualify editing but require **counterparty review** (a reviewer from a different program signs off on controversial comparative statements). The neutrality policy should follow a “**steelman requirement**”: comparative pages must include the strongest cited articulation of each program’s claim about continuum recovery/coarse-graining, plus at least one cited criticism or limitation acknowledged by that community. Authorship and credit should be handled via **versioned releases** with CITATION metadata: each release generates a citable DOI (e.g., via Zenodo), listing editors and contributors (ORCID encouraged), while each page records line-level contribution history (git blame) and a short “**How to cite this page**” block. This structure rewards contributors (especially juniors) while keeping authority tied to review and reproducibility rather than seniority.\n\nThe update workflow should be engineered for maintainability and reproducibility. Concretely: host the wiki as a **git-backed documentation site** (Markdown + static site generator) with mandatory **issue templates** for (i) content updates, (ii) benchmark additions, (iii) glossary/translation changes, and (iv) dispute resolution. Each substantive claim must include at least one **primary citation** (or clearly labeled “review-only” summary), and quantitative statements should, when possible, link to a minimal **reproduction artifact** (notebook, script, or exported dataset) with pinned environment. We recommend a two-lane editorial pipeline: a fast “**rolling draft**” lane (merged by program editors after one internal review) and a slower “**stable release**” lane (quarterly, with cross-program reviewer signoff, frozen citations, and changelog). Issue triage should be weekly (technical editors + rotating program editor), prioritizing: (1) correctness bugs, (2) missing canonical references, (3) translation-layer inconsistencies (e.g., incompatible uses of “scale” or “fixed point”), and (4) benchmark schema gaps. Citation standards should be uniform: arXiv/DOI required when available, include version/date for living references, and annotate whether a source is **review**, **primary**, **numerical**, or **phenomenology/constraints**. Finally, scheduled releases should include a short “**RG/coarse-graining crosswalk**” summary that reports what changed in each program’s continuum-limit story and whether any cross-program benchmark comparisons were added or revised—keeping the project aligned with the report’s central translation objective.\n\n### Initial prioritized bibliography (anchor references; ≥30, ≥5 per program)\n\n**A.

The central finding is that nearly every program already contains an “RG story,” but it is expressed through different **fundamental variables** and therefore different meanings of **scale** (e.g., worldsheet/moduli vs. target‑space energy; lattice/graph refinement vs. continuum momentum shells; tensor‑network depth vs. geometric length). Framing each approach by (i) its coarse‑graining operation, (ii) its assumptions about microscopic degrees of freedom, and (iii) the characteristic scales at which semiclassical gravity should emerge yields a common template to catalog **results, robustness, and open problems**—especially around fixed points/continuum limits, universality, and the reproduction of effective field theory and semiclassical general relativity.\n\nTo make the comparison operational, the report recommends building a **translation layer**: a minimal shared glossary and notation guide that maps each program’s RG objects (flows, couplings, effective actions/states, truncations, observables) onto common technical structures and defines cross‑checks that can be stated program‑independently. Finally, it outlines a governance and recruitment model for a credible living document: **program‑balanced editorial stewardship**, explicit contributor roles (program leads, translation editors, and cross‑check reviewers), and a lightweight update workflow that enforces neutrality, traceable claims, and periodic synthesis releases. The value is a durable, searchable resource that reduces conceptual friction between communities while sharpening the shared question: **which coarse‑graining mechanisms reliably produce the observed semiclassical regime, and under what assumptions and scales do they succeed or fail?**\n\n---\n\n## 1) UNIFYING FRAME: RENORMALIZATION/COARSE‑GRAINING AS THE COMMON LANGUAGE\n\nRenormalization and coarse‑graining provide a deliberately program‑agnostic way to state the shared problem that every quantum‑gravity approach faces: how a candidate microscopic description (discrete, algebraic, or continuum but nonperturbative) yields the observed semiclassical regime of general relativity plus quantum matter, with controlled approximations and falsifiable consequences. Framed this way, the cross‑program review and living wiki are not organized by historical schools, preferred ontologies, or “fundamental” variables, but by the flow from micro to macro: what is being averaged/blocked/integrated out, what notion of “scale” is used, which structures must survive coarse‑graining (local Lorentz invariance, diffeomorphism symmetry, unitarity/causality), and what counts as evidence that a continuum limit has been reached. This framing is now explicitly advocated as a unifying conceptual and technical thread across quantum‑gravity programs (e.g., the 2021 special‑issue perspective around RG/coarse‑graining as the bridge between microscopic models and emergent semiclassical behavior; see arXiv:2103.14605). It also naturally accommodates “top‑down” approaches (where the UV theory is formulated first and the IR must be recovered) and “bottom‑up/analogue” approaches (where effective gravitational dynamics and phenomenology emerge in laboratory or condensed‑matter settings), without forcing premature equivalences.\n\nTo make comparisons precise, the document standardizes a small set of axes that every entry must address. **(i) Degrees of freedom (DoF):** what are the microscopic variables (connections/holonomies and fluxes; spin networks; spin foams; tensors; group‑field quanta; lattice geometries; effective quasiparticles in analog systems), and what is their state space. Canonical LQG, for example, is anchored by Ashtekar’s connection variables and loop/spin‑network kinematics (Ashtekar 1986, DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.57.2244; Rovelli–Smolin 1990; Ashtekar–Rovelli–Smolin 1992; Rovelli–Smolin 1995), while contemporary spin‑foam LQG increasingly treats dynamics/continuum recovery as the central question. **(ii) Notion of scale:** is “scale” a length, an energy, a graph refinement level, a representation label, a tensor‑network depth, a causal set density, or an operational resolution tied to observables. **(iii) Coarse‑graining map:** what is the RG transformation (blocking, decimation, integrating out amplitudes, tensor network renormalization, functional RG flow, ensemble averaging), and what is held fixed (symmetries, boundary data, coupling definitions). In spin‑foam models (2018–2025 trend), background‑independent renormalization/coarse‑graining—including tensor‑network‑inspired algorithms—has become a primary tool for diagnosing continuum limits and for tracking the restoration of effective diffeomorphism symmetry that is typically broken by discretization at intermediate steps. **(iv) Fixed points/continuum limits:** what is meant by a UV completion or a continuum phase (critical surfaces, universality classes, second‑order transitions, perfect actions), and how one recognizes emergent GR. **(v) Observables:** what quantities are compared along the flow (correlation functions, spectral/hausdorff dimension, effective action couplings, entanglement measures, scattering/propagators, horizon thermodynamics). **(vi) Validation strategy:** what checks are internal (consistency, anomaly freedom, symmetry restoration, universality/robustness) versus external (phenomenology, cosmology, analog‑gravity experiments). Here, “analogue” and emergent‑gravity platforms illustrate what “validation” can mean when gravity is not fundamental: e.g., BEC analogue black holes probing Hawking‑like radiation through particle–partner correlations and entanglement signatures, and Weyl semimetal transport interpreted via gravitational/thermal anomalies—both serving as testbeds for coarse‑grained horizon physics and effective field theory assumptions, while also highlighting systematics and interpretational ambiguities.\n\nThe wiki therefore adopts a **minimal shared notation** that keeps each program’s native language intact but makes translation explicit. Each model is summarized by a tuple \\((\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{R}, \\{g_i\\}, \\mathcal{O})\\): microscopic DoF \\(\\mathcal{D}\\); state space/measure or amplitude definition \\(\\mathcal{S}\\); coarse‑graining/RG map \\(\\mathcal{R}_b:\\mathcal{S}\\!\\to\\!\\mathcal{S}'\\) parameterized by a blocking factor \\(b\\) (or an alternative scale parameter \\(k\\)); effective couplings \\(\\{g_i(k)\\}\\) or effective amplitudes; and a chosen set of observables \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) used to define “same physics” across scales. Where conventional beta functions exist, we write \\(\\beta_i=\\mathrm{d}g_i/\\mathrm{d}\\ln k\\); where they do not (common in background‑independent/discrete settings), we require an explicit statement of the flow parameter (refinement depth, coarse boundary graphs, truncation order) and the projection used to compare theories at different “resolutions.” Each page must also specify which symmetries are exact, which are emergent, and which are monitored as diagnostics (e.g., Ward identities or discrete analogues), since symmetry restoration is often the operational signature of a viable continuum regime in discretized quantum‑gravity dynamics.\n\nFinally, the section sets **standards for neutrality, evidence, and citations** to keep the cross‑program comparison constructive and updateable. “Neutrality” means the organizing categories are RG/coarse‑graining features rather than claims of fundamentality; every comparison must be stated in terms of the axes above and tied to concrete constructions (a defined coarse‑graining move, a computed flow, a demonstrated universality result, or a clearly described negative result). “Evidence” is tagged by type—formal (theorem/derivation), numerical (finite‑size scaling, tensor‑network truncations, Monte Carlo), phenomenological (constraints/forecasts), or experimental/analog—and each tag carries a required level of methodological detail (e.g., truncation scheme, convergence tests, error budgets, competing interpretations). Citations must distinguish primary sources from reviews and must record versioned identifiers (DOI/arXiv) and, for computational results, reproducibility hooks (code/data links when available). This structure is intended to make the living wiki a translation layer: it does not declare winners, but it makes clear where different programs are genuinely commensurable (shared coarse‑graining logic, shared universality targets) and where they diverge (in their definition of scale, their admissible coarse‑graining maps, and their criteria for having reached a continuum, semiclassical phase).\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 2) PROGRAM-BY-PROGRAM RG MAP (METHODS, ASSUMPTIONS, SCALES, RESULTS, OPEN PROBLEMS)\n\n## 2) Program-by-Program RG Map (Methods, Assumptions, Scales, Results, Open Problems)\n\nAcross quantum-gravity programs, “RG” and “coarse graining” appear in program-specific guises because the *fundamental variables* and hence the *meaning of scale* differ: worldsheet/moduli and target-space energies in string theory; graph refinement, spins, and boundary data in LQG/spin foams; lattice spacing and diffusion time in CDT; order-theoretic density in causal sets; momentum/derivative scales in functional RG for asymptotic safety; and representation cutoffs/tensor ranks in group field theory (GFT). A useful unifying lens is that each program seeks a continuum macroscopic regime where (i) effective locality and approximate diffeomorphism invariance emerge (or become exact), and (ii) long-distance observables become insensitive to UV details. The differences lie in what is held fixed while coarse graining (e.g., topology, causal structure, combinatorics), what counts as “integrating out” degrees of freedom (short strings, fine graph edges, small simplices, high spins, high tensor modes), and how fixed points/phase transitions are diagnosed (CFTs on the worldsheet, FRG non-Gaussian fixed points, tensor-network fixed points, lattice critical points, or universality of spectral dimension flow). Below we map each program to its characteristic variables, scale notions, practical RG schemes, and the main current “continuum-limit” bottlenecks.\n\n**String theory (incl. holography and swampland):** Fundamental variables depend on formulation: worldsheet fields with target-space background data (perturbative), D-branes/open strings and gauge theories (nonperturbative via dualities), and bulk fields in AdS/CFT where the *dual QFT RG scale* serves as a precise notion of “radial” bulk scale. Coarse graining is often realized as (a) worldsheet RG flows between 2D CFTs (beta functions ↔ spacetime equations of motion at lowest order), and (b) boundary Wilsonian RG or holographic renormalization in AdS/CFT (Hamilton–Jacobi/Fefferman–Graham expansions; multi-trace deformations; entanglement wedge reconstruction as a kind of scale-dependent encoding). Truncations are typically large‑N, large ’t Hooft coupling, supergravity limits, or consistent Kaluza–Klein truncations; in cosmology, EFT truncations with controlled towers (distance conjecture) are central. “Fixed points” appear as conformal fixed points (exact CFTs) or as strongly coupled CFTs dual to semiclassical AdS; phase structure includes confinement/deconfinement and holographic RG flows between CFTs. Successes: sharp nonperturbative definitions in backgrounds with known duals, quantitative control of quantum corrections in protected sectors, and a systematic constraint program (swampland) that functions as a meta‑RG consistency filter on low-energy EFTs. Open problems: extending beyond AdS (realistic cosmology, dS), making RG/scale notions intrinsic when no dual QFT is known, and clarifying how swampland constraints interplay with coarse graining (e.g., whether certain EFT “flows” are obstructed by emergent towers). *Core references/reviews:* Polchinski (string theory); Becker–Becker–Schwarz (string/M theory); Henningson–Skenderis and de Boer–Verlinde–Verlinde (holographic renormalization/RG); Aharony et al. (AdS/CFT review); Heemskerk–Polchinski and Faulkner–Liu–Rangamani (Wilsonian/holographic RG); Palti (swampland review), van Beest–Caldwell–Palti (modern swampland overviews).\n\n**Loop quantum gravity & spin foams:** Kinematics uses holonomies and fluxes (Ashtekar–Barbero variables), spin networks on graphs (SU(2) reps on links, intertwiners at nodes), and covariant spin-foam amplitudes as a sum over labeled 2‑complexes (EPRL/FK-type models). “Scale” is not a background momentum but is encoded in *graph refinement* (combinatorial resolution), *spin labels* (area/volume quanta), boundary state coarse graining, and sometimes *diffusion time* via spectral probes. Coarse graining is pursued through (i) refinement/decimation moves on 2‑complexes (Pachner-move-inspired), (ii) tensor-network renormalization of spin-foam amplitudes (viewing local amplitudes as tensors and iterating blocking), and (iii) group-theoretic RG ideas tracking how effective amplitudes change under integrating out internal spins/foams. Typical approximations include fixed 2‑complex truncations, large-spin (semiclassical) asymptotics, restriction to simplified boundary graphs, and “cylindrical consistency” assumptions in inductive limits. Phase structure is less settled than in lattice models, but there is increasing emphasis (2018–2025 trend) on diagnosing continuum limits and the restoration of *effective diffeomorphism symmetry* through coarse graining, with fixed points expected to encode topological/BF-like phases versus geometric phases. Successes: robust kinematical quantum geometry, controlled semiclassical limits for amplitudes in certain regimes, and rapidly maturing background-independent coarse-graining toolkits (notably tensor-network-inspired). Open problems: establishing a demonstrable continuum limit with the correct graviton/long-distance dynamics, clarifying universality classes across different foam discretizations, and connecting coarse-grained observables to low-energy EFT parameters. *Core references/reviews:* Rovelli (LQG); Thiemann (modern canonical LQG); Perez (spin-foam review); Engle (EPRL and developments); Bahr–Dittrich (coarse graining and diffeo symmetry ideas); recent spin-foam/tensor-network coarse graining reviews and topical special-issue editorials (2019–2025).\n\n**CDT (causal dynamical triangulations) and causal sets:** CDT’s fundamental variables are Lorentzian triangulations built from simplices with fixed edge lengths and a preferred foliation/causal structure; the scale is the lattice spacing (set by simplex edge length), system size (number of simplices), and *diffusion time* used to define the running spectral dimension. RG/coarse graining is implemented via Monte Carlo exploration of phase diagrams and finite-size scaling near critical lines; practical “RG” is extracted by identifying second-order transitions suitable for continuum limits and by tracking how effective actions and observables change under changes in bare couplings and lattice parameters. Truncations are intrinsic: fixed simplex types, fixed topology choices, and finite volumes; the hope is universality renders details irrelevant at criticality. Known results include a rich phase structure (multiple phases separated by transition lines) and robust evidence for scale-dependent spectral dimension (flowing toward ~2 at short diffusion times in several studies), plus emergence of extended 4D-like geometries in an appropriate phase. Open problems: constructing explicit coarse-graining transformations on triangulations (beyond indirect scaling analyses), matching continuum EFT couplings, and clarifying the relation of CDT critical points to asymptotic safety scenarios. Causal sets instead take a locally finite partially ordered set as fundamental; scale is set by the sprinkling density (discreteness scale) and coarse graining by *thinning* (random deletion) or sequential growth dynamics. Renormalization is less standardized: one studies how order-invariant observables and effective dynamics change under changes in density, and uses diffusion/spectral estimators and dimension measures as scale probes. Successes include a clean kinematical encoding of causality and Lorentz invariance (via Poisson sprinkling) and sharp statements about nonlocal operators; open problems center on producing realistic continuum dynamics, a systematic RG (fixed points/universality classes), and identifying observables that robustly reproduce GR in the macroscopic limit. *Core references/reviews:* Ambjørn–Jurkiewicz–Loll (CDT reviews); Loll (intro CDT); Bombelli–Sorkin and Surya (causal set reviews); Benincasa–Dowker (causal set d’Alembertian and dynamics); recent CDT phase-structure papers and causal-set phenomenology reviews.\n\n**Asymptotic safety and group field theory (GFT):** Asymptotic safety uses the metric (or tetrad/connection) as fundamental variables in a continuum QFT framework, with the *RG scale* a momentum/derivative scale \\(k\\) defined via a regulator in the functional RG (Wetterich equation). Coarse graining is explicitly Wilsonian: integrate out momentum shells to obtain a scale-dependent effective average action \\(\\Gamma_k\\). Truncations are central and systematic but approximate: Einstein–Hilbert truncations, \\(f(R)\\) and higher-derivative operators, inclusion of matter, bimetric and background-field split structures, and varying gauge/parameterization choices; reliability is assessed by stability under truncation enlargement and by scheme dependence checks. The key result is strong evidence (across many truncations) for a *non-Gaussian UV fixed point* with a finite number of relevant directions, plus rich IR behavior potentially matching classical GR with small quantum corrections; ongoing work refines matter couplings and addresses background independence. Open problems: fully controlling truncation/systematic errors, clarifying the physical meaning of “RG time” in a background-independent setting, and deriving robust, gauge-independent observable predictions (e.g., cosmological imprints). GFT formulates quantum gravity as a QFT on group manifolds, with fields \\(\\varphi(g_1,\\dots,g_d)\\) whose quanta correspond to spin-network nodes/simplicial building blocks; scale can be a representation/spin cutoff, tensor-rank refinements, or FRG momentum-like scales on the group. RG is pursued via FRG adapted to tensorial/group field theories and via tensor-model universality: one studies flows of interaction kernels (simplicial combinatorics) and searches for fixed points and phase transitions associated with condensate (continuum/geometry) phases. Truncations include polynomial interaction truncations, restriction to specific invariants (“melonic” dominance in certain regimes), and simplified kinetic terms; successes include a coherent RG language linking spin foams/tensor models and evidence for nontrivial fixed points and candidate geometric/condensate phases. Open problems: establishing a clear dictionary from GFT RG fixed points to continuum gravitational EFTs, controlling nonperturbative phases beyond leading tensor universality classes, and connecting to phenomenology. *Core references/reviews:* Reuter (foundational asymptotic safety); Percacci (asymptotic safety textbook/review); Niedermaier–Reuter (review); Eichhorn (modern FRG/asymptotic safety reviews); Rivasseau (tensor models); Oriti (GFT reviews and condensates); Carrozza (tensorial GFT renormalization); recent FRG-in-GFT papers and reviews (2018–2025).\n\n**Cross-program relationships and shared RG diagnostics:** Several bridges are now concrete enough to guide a “living RG map.” (1) *Spectral dimension and diffusion probes* provide a common, largely kinematics-agnostic observable used in CDT, some spin-foam/GFT contexts, and occasionally in effective/FRG analyses; agreement or disagreement of dimension flow becomes a comparative diagnostic. (2) *Tensor-network and tensor-model methods* increasingly unify spin-foam coarse graining with GFT/tensorial QFT renormalization, suggesting shared fixed-point structures and universality notions even when microscopic interpretations differ. (3) *Phase diagrams and continuum limits* are the common strategic target: CDT seeks second-order transitions; asymptotic safety seeks UV fixed points; spin foams/GFT seek coarse-graining fixed points restoring diffeomorphism symmetry and yielding geometric phases; string theory seeks consistent UV completions often characterized by CFT fixed points/holographic RG flows, with swampland constraints acting as consistency conditions on admissible EFT trajectories. The major open, cross-cutting problem is a *translation layer* from each program’s “scale” to others’—e.g., relating spin cutoffs/graph refinement to FRG momentum scales or to holographic radial scales—together with benchmark observables (two-point functions, universal critical exponents, anomaly coefficients, entanglement scalings) that can be computed in multiple frameworks and compared in shared RG language.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 3) TRANSLATION LAYER: SHARED GLOSSARY, CONCEPT MAPPING, AND CROSS-CHECKS\n\n### 3) Translation Layer: Shared Glossary, Concept Mapping, and Cross-Checks\n\nA practical “translation layer” is necessary because most quantum-gravity programs *do* share a coarse-graining/renormalization narrative (explicitly emphasized in cross-community framings around RG as a unifying thread), but they encode it in different objects (actions vs. transfer matrices vs. amplitudes vs. discrete growth dynamics) and—crucially—attach different meanings to the same words (“continuum limit,” “observable,” “background independence”). For COSMO’s benchmark-oriented workflow, the goal is not to force a single formalism, but to provide a minimal shared glossary that pins each term to (i) *what is being coarse-grained*, (ii) *what is held fixed vs. tuned*, (iii) *what data product is compared* (e.g., correlators, entanglement measures, spectral dimension), and (iv) which scheme/regularization choices are “gauge-like” ambiguities that must be tracked as metadata. This also aligns with the scope constraint already adopted in the existing translation guide: map terms only insofar as needed to compute and cross-check benchmark observables (rather than inventing full normalization dictionaries that are not yet supported by the current knowledge base).\n\n**First-pass shared glossary (concept → how it appears across programs; notation is indicative and should be treated as a living mapping).** (1) **Coarse-graining operator / RG step**: FRG communities implement a scale-dependent suppression of modes via a regulator (often discussed as integrating out fluctuations above/below a scale), while lattice/DT/CDT implement blocking moves or change of triangulation resolution; spin-foam/GFT renormalization talks about coarse-graining *amplitudes* or group-field interaction kernels; tensor-network approaches treat coarse-graining as an explicit isometry/disentangler circuit; causal sets typically phrase it as thinning/sprinkling density changes or decimation of elements. (2) **Effective action**: FRG uses a scale-dependent effective action (the “running” generator of 1PI correlators); spin-foam/GFT analogues may be an effective group-field action after integrating degrees of freedom; lattice approaches often use an effective action inferred from ensembles/transfer matrices; holography uses a boundary generating functional tied to bulk dynamics; analogue-gravity and decoherence communities instead emphasize effective open-system dynamics (master equations, noise kernels) as the “effective description.” (3) **Continuum limit**: on the lattice it is a critical/large-correlation-length limit as discretization scale → 0; in FRG it is a UV completion (often framed as approaching a fixed point); in spin foams/GFT it is the emergence of a continuum geometry from many building blocks; in causal sets it is recovery of Lorentzian manifold behavior in suitable large-number-density limits; in analogue gravity it is not “fundamental continuum” but the regime where emergent field modes reproduce QFT-in-curved-spacetime predictions within controlled systematics. (4) **Universality**: FRG/lattice emphasize regulator/discretization independence of long-distance observables (critical exponents, scaling functions); tensor networks phrase it as insensitivity to microscopic circuit details given the same fixed-point tensor; causal sets seek universality of continuum observables under different microscopic dynamics; in phenomenology/analogue settings it means robustness of signatures under experimental imperfections and backreaction modeling. (5) **Fixed point**: FRG speaks directly of RG fixed points controlling UV/IR behavior; lattice/DT/CDT identify critical points/lines in bare-coupling space; tensor networks identify fixed-point tensors; spin-foam/GFT look for fixed points of coarse-graining flows of amplitudes/couplings; holography ties fixed points to CFTs (and deformations as flows). (6) **Truncation scheme**: FRG uses explicit truncations of the effective action (operator basis cutoffs); spin-foam/GFT truncate interaction terms/representation content or restrict foam complexes; lattice simulations truncate by finite volume, finite lattice spacing, and restricted move sets; tensor networks truncate bond dimension; causal sets truncate by finite element number and finite sampling; analogue/decoherence truncate environment models and noise spectra parametrizations (often controlled via filter-function analyses). (7) **Phase transition / order parameter**: in lattice/DT/CDT, phases of geometry are identified by scaling properties and order parameters (e.g., volume profile/transfer-matrix indicators); FRG identifies transitions via flows and relevant directions; spin-foam/GFT sometimes uses condensate order parameters (where applicable) or observables diagnosing geometric phases; tensor networks use entanglement patterns as phase diagnostics; causal sets may use order parameters tied to locality/dimension estimators; analogue systems treat horizon formation and emission correlations as “order-parameter-like” diagnostics but must separate them from mundane systematics. (8) **Running couplings**: FRG explicitly computes scale-dependent couplings; lattice infers effective couplings from ensemble behavior; spin-foam/GFT defines running couplings in the effective group-field description; tensor networks encode running in scale-dependent tensors; holography encodes running via radial evolution/renormalization; in decoherence/phenomenology the “running” analogue often appears as scale-dependent noise spectra or effective parameters inferred across experimental bandwidths. (9) **Background-(in)dependence**: FRG has both background-field implementations and ongoing work toward background-independent observables; lattice/DT/CDT aim for geometric dynamics without a fixed metric background but still require a choice of ensemble and foliation constraints (program-dependent); spin foams/GFT are typically framed as background-independent at the kinematical level but require choices of boundary data/embedding interpretation; causal sets are background-free but must recover continuum symmetries statistically; analogue gravity is explicitly *background-dependent* (a laboratory medium), used as a controlled proxy for kinematics/dynamics of fields on effective geometries. (10) **Observables**: across programs, the translation layer should privilege observables that can be computed in multiple formalisms—e.g., **(i)** two-point functions/“graviton proxy” correlators (where defined), **(ii)** spectral/heat-kernel dimension as a scale-dependent diagnostic, **(iii)** entanglement entropy or mutual information (explicitly highlighted in causal-set QFT contexts, and also natural in holography/tensor networks), **(iv)** scattering/in-in correlators (noted for causal sets), and **(v)** decoherence rates/noise spectral densities with filter-function outputs (explicitly part of the decoherence benchmark framing). The key semantic cross-check is: *what is operationally measurable vs. purely formal,* and *how much gauge/scheme dependence remains* after specifying the observable.\n\nCommon technical tools provide the “bridges” that make these translations actionable rather than rhetorical. On the RG side this includes functional RG equations (FRG), large‑N expansions in settings where they apply (notably in holography-adjacent analyses), and systematic truncation/error estimation. On the discrete/numerical side, lattice/DT/CDT methods, Monte Carlo sampling, and transfer-matrix/finite-size scaling techniques supply controlled extrapolations toward continuum behavior. Tensor-network renormalization offers an explicitly constructive coarse-graining map (and a natural interface to entanglement-based diagnostics). Heat-kernel/spectral-dimension estimators form a widely portable diagnostic because they can be computed on discrete ensembles, effective field theories, or reconstructed geometries. Finally, the analogue-gravity and decoherence threads contribute a different kind of toolchain: end-to-end systematics modeling (including backreaction where relevant), plus noise-spectrum and filter-function analyses that turn “environmental coupling” into reproducible, comparable metrics.\n\nTo keep cross-program comparisons honest, COSMO should adopt **sanity checks and benchmark comparisons** that are deliberately redundant across methods and explicitly track scheme dependence. Minimal cross-checks include: (i) **spectral dimension vs. scale** computed in at least one discrete approach (DT/CDT/spin-foam/GFT ensemble or causal set) and one continuum/RG-motivated effective description, checking qualitative flow and identifying which features are regulator/discretization artifacts; (ii) **finite-size / finite-resolution scaling** comparisons (lattice spacing ↔ FRG cutoff scale ↔ tensor-network layer depth ↔ causal-set density), with a shared metadata schema recording what is tuned and what is held fixed; (iii) **two-point/correlation-function consistency** where each program has a well-defined analogue (even if only a “proxy”), accompanied by a translation note clarifying what degrees of freedom the correlator refers to; (iv) **entanglement-based diagnostics** computed in causal-set QFT (explicitly in scope) and, where available, matched to tensor-network/holographic expectations at the level of scaling behavior rather than absolute normalization; and (v) for laboratory-facing benchmarks, **systematics vs. signal separation**: reproduce Hawking-like emission/correlation analyses under controlled model variations and compare with decoherence-style noise/filter-function outputs to ensure that “RG-like running” inferred from data is not just an artefact of instrumentation or environmental modeling. The operational outcome is a living translation table (terms + semantics + required metadata) paired with a small set of benchmark plots whose *agreement/disagreement patterns* are interpretable across communities without collapsing real conceptual differences.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## 4) LIVING WIKI IMPLEMENTATION: CONTRIBUTORS, GOVERNANCE, AND UPDATE WORKFLOW\n\n## 4) Living Wiki Implementation: Contributors, Governance, and Update Workflow\n\nA credible “living wiki” for cross-program quantum gravity must be staffed and governed as a **balanced, translation-first editorial project**, not as a loosely moderated notes dump. We recommend recruiting **program lead editors** (one per program) empowered to curate scope and canonical references for their community, paired with **cross-program technical editors** responsible for enforcing the shared RG/coarse-graining translation layer (definitions of coarse-graining maps, continuum limits, universality/fixed points, scale notions in background-independent settings, and reporting contracts for benchmark observables). Each program team should include (i) **reviewers** (senior domain experts who sign off on “stable releases”), and (ii) **junior contributors** (postdocs/PhD students) who do the primary drafting, figure recreation, and reference audits under guidance. The minimal balanced set of programs for governance purposes is: **String theory & holography**, **Loop quantum gravity & spin foams (incl. GFT/tensor-network coarse-graining)**, **Asymptotic safety / functional RG**, **Causal dynamical triangulations & lattice/discrete gravity**, and **Effective/perturbative quantum gravity & phenomenology interfaces** (including “benchmark observables” like ringdown/echo parameterizations, Hawking-flux deviations, and information-theoretic diagnostics where applicable). To prevent dominance by any one community, steering votes should be **one-program–one-vote** on scope changes and release blocking, with technical editors holding veto power only on **format/verification compliance** (citations, schema, reproducibility), not on scientific interpretation.\n\nNeutrality and conflict-of-interest rules should be explicit and operational. Every page should carry a “**status tag**” (Draft / Reviewed / Stable / Deprecated) and a “**positioning box**” that separates (a) consensus statements, (b) active controversies, and (c) speculative proposals, with claims linked to sources and (where feasible) benchmark outputs. Contributors must file a lightweight **COI disclosure** (e.g., “author of cited work,” “collaborator,” “competing model”) at the page or section level; COIs do not disqualify editing but require **counterparty review** (a reviewer from a different program signs off on controversial comparative statements). The neutrality policy should follow a “**steelman requirement**”: comparative pages must include the strongest cited articulation of each program’s claim about continuum recovery/coarse-graining, plus at least one cited criticism or limitation acknowledged by that community. Authorship and credit should be handled via **versioned releases** with CITATION metadata: each release generates a citable DOI (e.g., via Zenodo), listing editors and contributors (ORCID encouraged), while each page records line-level contribution history (git blame) and a short “**How to cite this page**” block. This structure rewards contributors (especially juniors) while keeping authority tied to review and reproducibility rather than seniority.\n\nThe update workflow should be engineered for maintainability and reproducibility. Concretely: host the wiki as a **git-backed documentation site** (Markdown + static site generator) with mandatory **issue templates** for (i) content updates, (ii) benchmark additions, (iii) glossary/translation changes, and (iv) dispute resolution. Each substantive claim must include at least one **primary citation** (or clearly labeled “review-only” summary), and quantitative statements should, when possible, link to a minimal **reproduction artifact** (notebook, script, or exported dataset) with pinned environment. We recommend a two-lane editorial pipeline: a fast “**rolling draft**” lane (merged by program editors after one internal review) and a slower “**stable release**” lane (quarterly, with cross-program reviewer signoff, frozen citations, and changelog). Issue triage should be weekly (technical editors + rotating program editor), prioritizing: (1) correctness bugs, (2) missing canonical references, (3) translation-layer inconsistencies (e.g., incompatible uses of “scale” or “fixed point”), and (4) benchmark schema gaps. Citation standards should be uniform: arXiv/DOI required when available, include version/date for living references, and annotate whether a source is **review**, **primary**, **numerical**, or **phenomenology/constraints**. Finally, scheduled releases should include a short “**RG/coarse-graining crosswalk**” summary that reports what changed in each program’s continuum-limit story and whether any cross-program benchmark comparisons were added or revised—keeping the project aligned with the report’s central translation objective.\n\n### Initial prioritized bibliography (anchor references; ≥30, ≥5 per program)\n\n**A.

The central finding is that nearly every program already contains an “RG story,” but it is expressed through different **fundamental variables** and therefore different meanings of **scale** (e.g., worldsheet/moduli vs. target‑space energy; lattice/graph refinement vs. continuum momentum shells; tensor‑network depth vs. geometric length). Framing each approach by (i) its coarse‑graining operation, (ii) its assumptions about microscopic degrees of freedom, and (iii) the characteristic scales at which semiclassical gravity should emerge yields a common template to catalog **results, robustness, and open problems**—especially around fixed points/continuum limits, universality, and the reproduction of effective field theory and semiclassical general relativity.\n\nTo make the comparison operational, the report recommends building a **translation layer**: a minimal shared glossary and notation guide that maps each program’s RG objects (flows, couplings, effective actions/states, truncations, observables) onto common technical structures and defines cross‑checks that can be stated program‑independently. Finally, it outlines a governance and recruitment model for a credible living document: **program‑balanced editorial stewardship**, explicit contributor roles (program leads, translation editors, and cross‑check reviewers), and a lightweight update workflow that enforces neutrality, traceable claims, and periodic synthesis releases. The value is a durable, searchable resource that reduces conceptual friction between communities while sharpening the shared question: **which coarse‑graining mechanisms reliably produce the observed semiclassical regime, and under what assumptions and scales do they succeed or fail?**","sectionsGenerated":8,"sourcesConsulted":5,"knowledgeGaps":["Gap 1: Missing concrete program inventory and stakeholder contacts — the plan assumes a set of 'programs' but lacks a vetted list of participating communities (e.g., statistical physics, condensed matter RG, QFT/particle physics, dynamical systems, ML deep learning, multiscale materials modeling, climate/ocean modeling, network science) with named domain experts/representatives, their typical model classes, canonical papers/codebases, and willingness to contribute.

In background-independent/discrete approaches (tensor models, spin foams, causal sets), the notion of “scale” is generalized: coarse-graining is performed over combinatorial degrees of freedom (e.g., tensor size/rank, refinement of 2-complexes, or order-theoretic substructures) rather than over distances defined on a fixed manifold.\n\nOperational/testable frameworks show a parallel convergence: instead of tying predictions to unobservable Planck-scale microstructure, they express quantum-gravity signatures in terms of experimentally accessible preparations, interventions, and readouts. This includes (i) device-independent/operational formalisms for indefinite causal structure (process-matrix frameworks and new causal inequalities) and (ii) tabletop or near-term experimental concepts (gravity-mediated entanglement, semiclassical-gravity deviations, Josephson-junction readouts) that translate theoretical claims into measurable correlation/visibility/current signatures.

Reuter‑type fixed points and discrete fixed points describe the same universality class.","Translate device‑independent causal‑nonseparability diagnostics into experimentally robust protocols and link them to gravity‑mediated effects: (a) adapt the new time‑symmetric/process‑matrix causal inequalities to realistic noise, finite statistics, and limited control; (b) build explicit experimental proposals that couple these diagnostics to tabletop gravity‑mediated setups (QGEM variants), specifying timing, shielding, and state‑preparation/readout constraints so a violation would clearly indicate nonclassical causal structure rather than environmental artefacts; and (c) develop quantitative models that predict how semi‑classical or weak‑field gravitational corrections map onto the causal‑inequality observables.","Create cross‑program numerical/analytical benchmarks to connect asymptotic‑safety FRG results and discrete coarse‑graining fixed points: (a) design toy models (simplified scalar+geometric sectors, lower dimensional gravity analogues) amenable to both FRG and tensor/foam coarse‑graining and compute flows on both sides; (b) compare spectra of relevant operators, scaling exponents, and key observables (e.g., relational two‑point functions) to diagnose universality or mismatches; and (c) if mismatches appear, isolate which ingredients (truncation choices, measure/regularization, notion of scale) are responsible and propose modified coarse‑graining schemes to reconcile them."],"timestamp":"2025-12-22T21:17:07.520Z"},3],"progressReports":[{"percent":5,"message":"Querying memory for relevant

The most continuously developed and review-supported track is Asymptotic Safety, where Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) methods are used to search for and characterize an interacting UV fixed point, then follow RG trajectories to extract emergent scales and potential phenomenology—especially in increasingly detailed gravity–matter systems and higher-order truncations.\n\nIn background-independent/discrete approaches, coarse-graining is implemented more literally as maps between amplitudes on finer and coarser complexes, aiming at discretization independence and a continuum limit. Spin-foam coarse-graining has consolidated around RG-flow constructions with boundary data and numerical/tensor-network tools, while Group Field Theory (especially tensorial GFT) has advanced a QFT-style renormalization program (power counting, beta functions, FRG flows) with an eye toward phase structure and condensation scenarios.

high‑precision astrophysical/cosmological data and identify optimal future probes.","Develop operational, experimentally discriminating probes of quantum gravitational causal structure and provide rigorous criteria separating genuine gravitational effects from quantum-control lookalikes: (a) formalize observable signatures of indefinite causal order that cannot be simulated by non‑gravitational

In continuum settings—especially the asymptotic safety / functional renormalization group (FRG) program—this takes the concrete form of following an RG flow (e.g., Wetterich equation for a scale-dependent effective action) toward an interacting UV fixed point and extracting a small set of UV-relevant directions to argue predictivity. In background-independent/discrete approaches (tensor models, spin foams, causal sets), the notion of “scale” is generalized: coarse-graining is performed over combinatorial degrees of freedom (e.g., tensor size/rank, refinement of 2-complexes, or order-theoretic substructures) rather than over distances defined on a fixed manifold.\n\nOperational/testable frameworks show a parallel convergence: instead of tying predictions to unobservable Planck-scale microstructure, they express quantum-gravity signatures in terms of experimentally accessible preparations, interventions, and readouts. This includes (i) device-independent/operational formalisms for indefinite causal structure (process-matrix frameworks and new causal inequalities) and (ii) tabletop or near-term experimental concepts (gravity-mediated entanglement, semiclassical-gravity deviations, Josephson-junction readouts) that translate theoretical claims into measurable correlation/visibility/current signatures. A cross-program theme emerging from the collected sources is the drive to define relational (gauge-invariant) observables and track their behavior under coarse-graining/RG flows, enabling more robust comparisons between discrete and continuum constructions and clearer pathways from microscopic models to observable consequences.\n\n{\"type\":\"finding\",\"source\":\"agent_1766438119668_zmgsimo\",\"timestamp\":\"2025-12-22T21:18:57.569Z\"}\n\nSystem already has 3 relevant memory nodes.

Assert all required directories exist\n  - Assert all required files exist and are non-empty\n- If using git: `git status` should show new files only under `outputs/benchmark-repo/`.\n\n4) **Outputs / results**\n- A fully populated `outputs/benchmark-repo/` with the exact required layout\n- A README containing a clear versioning/tags/releases policy\n- A repeatable script used to generate the repo (kept under `scripts/` or logged in the experiment output)\n\n---\n\n### Experiment 2 — Schema/data/benchmark harness smoke test (minimal executable workflow)\n**Purpose:** Ensure the repo isn’t just a skeleton, but can run a minimal benchmark pipeline end-to-end.\n\n1) **Computation / code to execute**\n- Add minimal “hello benchmark” components:\n  - `schemas/benchmark-result.schema.json` (or equivalent) defining the structure of results (name, timestamp, metrics, system info, git commit, etc.)\n  - `benchmarks/run_benchmarks.(py|sh)` that:\n    - Runs a tiny benchmark (e.g., loop timing or toy function)\n    - Writes result JSON into `outputs/results.json`\n    - Validates it against the schema\n  - `examples/` includes a runnable example invoking the benchmark runner.\n\n2) **Inputs required**\n- A sample dataset (optional) placed under `data/` (could be a tiny CSV/JSON)\n- Dependency list if needed (e.g., `jsonschema` for Python)\n- Environment info (OS, Python version) captured for result metadata\n\n3) **Tests / checks to run**\n- Execute benchmark runner once:\n  - Confirm `outputs/results.json` is produced\n  - Confirm schema validation passes\n- Check determinism basics (optional):\n  - Run twice; ensure required fields exist; allow timestamps to differ but structure should match schema\n\n4) **Outputs / results**\n- `outputs/results.json` created and schema-valid\n- A demonstrated path for future benchmarks: `benchmarks/` → `outputs/` with validation\n\n---\n\n### Experiment 3 — Repository quality gates (CI-style checks)\n**Purpose:** Verify the repo meets baseline maintainability: formatting, tests, contribution process, and versioning consistency.\n\n1) **Computation / code to execute**\n- Add minimal automated checks:\n  - `tests/test_repo_layout.(py)` verifying required files/dirs exist\n  - `tests/test_schema_validation.(py)` verifying example results validate\n- Optional: add pre-commit hooks or CI config (GitHub Actions) to run:\n  - unit tests\n  - formatting/lint (if language-specific)\n  - schema validation\n\n2) **Inputs required**\n- Test runner choice (e.g., `pytest`)\n- Tooling config (optional): `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, CI yaml\n\n3) **Tests / checks to run**\n- Run test suite locally:\n  - `pytest -q` (or equivalent)\n- If git is available: tag simulation check\n  - Ensure README versioning section matches expected tagging format `v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`, etc.\n\n4) **Outputs / results**\n- Passing test run confirming:\n  - Required structure exists\n  - Benchmark output conforms to schema\n  - Versioning policy is present and consistent\n\n---\n\n## Success criteria (what “answers the goal”)\n- `outputs/benchmark-repo/` contains: README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, (optional) CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and directories `src/`, `examples/`, `schemas/`, `benchmarks/`, `tests/`, `data/`, `outputs/`.\n- README explicitly defines versioning policy and how tags/releases will be created for `v0.1`, `v0.2`, …\n- At least one executable benchmark produces output into `outputs/` and is validated against a schema.\n- Automated tests confirm layout + schema validation.","reasoning":""},"executionResults":[{"timestamp":"2025-12-22T21:23:18.050Z","content":"Repository scaffold + minimal benchmark pipeline + quality gates were generated and executed successfully under:\n\n- **Repo root:** `/mnt/data/outputs/benchmark-repo`\n\n## Experiment 1 — Scaffold generation (repo initialization)\n\n### Created directories\n`src/`, `examples/`, `schemas/`, `benchmarks/`, `tests/`, `data/`, `outputs/` (plus `scripts/` for reproducibility)\n\n### Created baseline files (all non-empty)\n- `README.md` (includes **SemVer** + pre-1.0 rules and tag format `v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`, …)\n- `LICENSE` (**MIT**)\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md`\n- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (**included**)\n- `.gitignore`\n- `pyproject.toml` (Python tooling, pytest config)\n\nValidation checks passed: all required dirs/files exist and are non-empty.\n\n## Experiment 2 — Schema + benchmark harness smoke test\n\n### Added\n- `schemas/benchmark-result.schema.json` (JSON Schema for benchmark results)\n- `benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py`:\n  -

(only a separate example snippet for `symbolic_rg_flow.py` is shown).\n- No memory node provides the **actual syntax error messages**, line numbers, or failing traceback from `pytest -q`.\n- No memory node provides the **CLI example command** to run (the only explicit “Run:” line shown is for `python -m experiments.symbolic_rg_flow --outdir outputs/rg`).\n- I do not have the ability, within these constraints, to actually execute `pytest -q` or run a CLI command and report real output—there are no recorded run logs for those commands in the supplied knowledge.\n\nSo I cannot truthfully claim to have “fixed” specific syntax errors in those specific files, nor that I reran `pytest -q` and a CLI example and saw them pass.\n\nWhat I *can* do, grounded strictly in the provided knowledge, is: (1) identify what files are actually evidenced in memory that look like the relevant CLI and experiment entrypoints, (2) point out the mismatch with the mission’s filenames, and (3) specify exactly what additional concrete information is required to perform the edits and confirmations.\n\n---\n\n## What the provided evidence actually contains (file-level)\n\n### 1) A CLI file exists in the knowledge — but it is **not** `qg_bench/cli.py`\nThe memory explicitly references:\n\n- **`outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py`** (export task)  \n  Source: item **5** (“Export the existing file at outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py … CLI entrypoint to run benchmarks end-to-end producing output files under outputs/ for local use and CI verification.”)\n\nThis is the only CLI file path explicitly tied to “benchmarks” and “CLI entrypoint” in the provided knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, another code-creation output lists:\n- **`src/cli.py`** (size 6187)  \n  Source: item **17** (file list includes `src/cli.py`)\n\n**Implication:** The mission’s target file `qg_bench/cli.py` is not evidenced in the memory. The closest grounded candidates are:\n- `outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py` (explicitly “CLI entrypoint”)\n- `src/cli.py` (exists per file manifest)\n\n### 2) An experiments module is evidenced — but not “toy_…”\nThe only directly quoted experiment code snippet is:\n\n- `symbolic_rg_flow.py` with module run instruction:\n  > `python -m experiments.symbolic_rg_flow --outdir outputs/rg`  \n  Source: item **12**\n\nThis snippet shows a valid Python header and imports:\n- `from __future__ import annotations`\n- `from dataclasses import dataclass`\n- `from pathlib import Path`\n- `import argparse`\n\nBut the mission says the syntax error is in **`src/experiments/toy_...`**, and the exact file is not provided in the memory list.\n\n**Implication:** The only experiment file content we can reference is `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow`. There is no grounded “toy_*” filename shown.\n\n### 3) CI / pytest context exists, but no failing output\nThere is mention of:\n- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` intended to run pytest and fail on mismatches  \n  Source: items **3** and **7**\n\nBut the actual content of `ci.yml` and any pytest output are not included in the provided memory.\n\n---\n\n## Why I cannot “fix the reported syntax errors” with the current data\n\nTo fix a syntax error in a specific file, we need at minimum one of:\n- the file content (or at least the erroneous section), or\n- the exact `SyntaxError` traceback with file path + line number + offending token/line.\n\nThe provided knowledge contains neither for:\n- `qg_bench/cli.py`\n- `src/experiments/toy_...` (exact file unspecified)\n\nIt also contains no captured `pytest -q` output confirming failures or subsequent passes.\n\nBecause the instruction is to be “grounded in the research data” and to use “ONLY the specific facts and findings provided,” I cannot invent file contents, error messages, or test outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Concrete, minimal information needed to complete the mission (and why)\n\nTo proceed deterministically (and to produce a verifiable patch), you need to supply **one** of the following bundles:\n\n### Bundle A (best): traceback + file content excerpt\n1. The exact `pytest -q` failing output showing the syntax errors:\n   - file path(s)\n   - line number(s)\n   - error snippet\n2. The relevant sections (or full contents) of:\n   - `qg_bench/cli.py`\n   - the exact `src/experiments/toy_*.py` file referenced\n\n### Bundle B: just the files\nProvide the full contents of:\n- `qg_bench/cli.py`\n- the exact `src/experiments/toy_*.py` file\n\nThen the syntax errors can be found by inspection and corrected.\n\n### Bundle C: repository tree confirmation\nIf `qg_bench/cli.py` does not exist, confirm the intended file is instead one of the known CLI candidates evidenced in memory:\n- `outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py` (explicitly described as CLI entrypoint)\n- `src/cli.py` (present in file list)\n\n---\n\n## What I can responsibly infer as likely “fix targets” (without claiming edits)\n\nGiven the mismatch between the mission’s `qg_bench/cli.py` and the evidenced CLI files, the most plausible interpretation (still only a hypothesis) is:\n\n- The syntax error may actually be in **`outputs/src/benchmarks/cli.py`** (explicitly “CLI entrypoint”), *or* **`src/cli.py`**, rather than `qg_bench/cli.py`.\n\nSimilarly, for experiments:\n- The only experiment entrypoint shown is `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow` (item **12**), but the mission says “toy_…”. Without the exact path, we cannot identify the failing file.\n\nI am not asserting this is correct—only that these are the only CLI/experiment-like artifacts grounded in the provided knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the supplied memory items, it is **not possible** to complete the requested workflow (edit specific files, rerun `pytest -q`, rerun a CLI example, and confirm success) in a way that is both **self-contained** and **strictly grounded** in the provided evidence. The knowledge base does not include:\n\n- the contents of `qg_bench/cli.py`,\n- the identity/contents of the `src/experiments/toy_...` file,\n- any actual syntax error traceback,\n- any recorded `pytest -q` run output,\n- any recorded CLI example run output (other than the separate `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow` run instruction).\n\nIf you provide either the failing `pytest -q` traceback(s) or the contents of the two target files, I can produce precise, line-specific syntax fixes and (separately) outline exactly what `pytest -q` and the CLI run should show after the patch—without inventing results.","format":"markdown","metadata":{"author":"COSMO Document Agent","createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:52:29.822Z","mode":"memory_based","memoryNodesUsed":17,"formattedAt":"2025-12-22T21:52:29.822Z"},"filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766440311237_ia5rdl5/agent_1766440311237_ia5rdl5_report_01.md","wordCount":1008,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:52:29.826Z","version":"1.0.0","deliverablePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766440311237_ia5rdl5/agent_1766440311237_ia5rdl5_report_01.md","metadataPath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766440311237_ia5rdl5/agent_1766440311237_ia5rdl5_report_01_metadata.json"},"metadata":{"type":"report","title":"Generated report","filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766440311237_ia5rdl5/agent_1766440311237_ia5rdl5_report_01.md","wordCount":1008,"filesCreated":1,"status":"complete","createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:52:29.826Z"}},"metadata":{"type":"report","title":"Generated report","filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766440311237_ia5rdl5/agent_1766440311237_ia5rdl5_report_01.md","wordCount":1008,"filesCreated":1,"status":"complete","createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:52:29.826Z"},"queuedAt":"2025-12-22T21:52:30.647Z","processed":false,"integrated":false}

Benchmark observables (3–5) (normative)\n\nv0.1 defines **four** benchmark observables. These are expressed as named outputs so that cases can require any subset while keeping a common structure.\n\n### O1) RG beta-function value: `beta_lambda`\n**Definition:** The beta function for the toy model used in the code artifact `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow`:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = -\\varepsilon \\lambda + a \\lambda^2, \\quad a = \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2}, \\quad t=\\log(\\mu/\\mu_0)\n\\]\n\n**Observable value:**  \n`beta_lambda = -epsilon * lambda + a * lambda^2` evaluated at the case’s specified parameter values.\n\n**Inputs required in the case:** `epsilon`, `lambda`.\n\n**Output invariants:** Must be a finite number.\n\n---\n\n### O2) Fixed-point coupling: `lambda_star`\n**Definition:** Non-trivial fixed point of the one-loop beta function above, i.e. solution of `beta_lambda = 0` with `lambda ≠ 0`:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_\\* = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{a}\n\\]\n\nwith \\( a = \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} \\).\n\n**Inputs required in the case:** `epsilon`.\n\n**Output invariants:** Must be a finite number.\n\n---\n\n### O3) Integrated RG flow end-point: `lambda_t`\n**Definition:** The coupling after integrating the ODE\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = -\\varepsilon \\lambda + a \\lambda^2\n\\]\nfrom `t0` to `t1`, with initial value `lambda(t0)=lambda0`.\n\nBecause the introspected code describes a “Symbolic + numerical RG flow toy model” that produces reproducible outputs and a “small JSON summary”, this observable is included as the standard “pipeline reproducibility” target for integration.\n\n**Inputs required in the case:** `epsilon`, `lambda0`, `t0`, `t1`, `integrator` settings (see §3.3).\n\n**Output invariants:** Must be a finite number. If the chosen integration would diverge, the case should not be used as a canonical test vector.\n\n---\n\n### O4) Reproducibility digest: `result_digest`\n**Definition:** A deterministic digest over the computed outputs and the validated benchmark-case metadata that locks semantics (contract version, model, regulator/truncation, and numeric results) to ensure pipeline reproducibility.\n\nThis is included to support the existing pattern in the repository: expected outputs stored under `outputs/expected/*.expected.json` and tested via reproducibility tests (`outputs/tests/test_benchmark_reproducibility.py`).\n\n**Inputs required in the case:** none beyond required metadata + computed results.\n\n**Output invariants:** Must be a string.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Required metadata (normative)\n\nEvery benchmark case MUST include the following top-level metadata. These fields are required because they were explicitly identified in the v0.1 “benchmark contract” update as the minimum needed to “lock semantics for validation” and to ensure reproducibility.\n\n### 3.1 Contract identifiers\n- `contract_version` (string): benchmark contract format version; required to lock semantics for validation.  \n- `task_id` (string): v0.1 task identifier; required.  \n- `case_id` (string): unique case identifier; required.  \n- `description` (string): human-readable description; required.\n\n### 3.2 Reference algorithm pointer\n- `reference` (object; required):\n  - `implementation` (string): reference implementation module path; aligned to repo artifact `outputs/src/benchmarks/compute.py` (for generic compute) and the toy RG module described by introspection: `experiments.symbolic_rg_flow`.\n  - `notes` (string, optional): clarifies any deterministic choices.\n\nThis field exists to satisfy the “reference algorithm” requirement in the v0.1 contract update.\n\n### 3.3 Model + regulator/truncation (required)\nBecause the mission requires “required metadata (model, regulator/truncation, uncertainties)”, and the v0.1 update requires required metadata sufficient for reproducibility, each case MUST specify:\n\n- `model` (object; required)\n  - `name` (string; required). v0.1 canonical name: `\"phi4_4_minus_eps_one_loop\"`.\n  - `parameters` (object; required): includes `epsilon` and, depending on required observables, `lambda`, `lambda0`, `t0`, `t1`.\n\n- `regulator` (object; required)\n  - `name` (string; required): free string identifying the regulator choice.\n  - `details` (object, optional): additional regulator settings.\n\n- `truncation` (object; required)\n  - `name` (string; required): free string identifying truncation.\n  - `details` (object, optional): additional truncation settings.\n\nThese are required to satisfy the “regulator/truncation” metadata requirement and to prevent ambiguous comparisons across implementations.\n\n### 3.4 Uncertainty / tolerance model (required)\nTo satisfy the “uncertainties” requirement and to enable a tool to compute pass/fail, each case MUST specify:\n\n- `uncertainties` (object; required)\n  - `comparison` (string; required): `\"absolute\"`, `\"relative\"`, or `\"abs_or_rel\"`.\n  - `atol` (number; required): absolute tolerance.\n  - `rtol` (number; required): relative tolerance.\n  - `notes` (string, optional).\n\nThis is intentionally explicit so that tolerance rules are not implicit or hidden in code.\n\n---\n\n## 4. File formats and required artifacts (normative)\n\n### 4.1 Benchmark case file (input)\n- Format: JSON\n- Extension: `.json`\n- Validated by: `schema.json` (provided below)\n\nRecommended repository layout (aligned to existing artifacts):\n- `outputs/examples/benchmark_case_001.json` (example case)\n- Additional cases under `outputs/examples/`\n\n### 4.2 Expected output file (golden)\n- Format: JSON\n- Extension: `.expected.json`\n- Purpose: reproducibility checks (aligned to `outputs/expected/benchmark_case_001.expected.json`)\n- Required fields:\n  - `case_id`\n  - `contract_version`\n  - `computed` (object): the expected observable values for the observables declared in the case\n  - `result_digest` (string): expected digest\n\n### 4.3 Result file (produced by implementations)\n- Format: JSON\n- Extension: `.result.json` (recommended)\n- Required fields:\n  - `case_id`, `contract_version`\n  - `computed` (object): computed observables\n  - `diagnostics` (object): optional details used by validators/CI\n  - `result_digest` (string): computed digest\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Benchmarks (v0.1): 5 observables\n\nThe suite is intentionally small (v0.1). It covers:  \n(1) graviton / 2-pt proxy, (2) curvature/volume scaling exponent,  \n(3) effective cosmological constant estimator, (4) diffeo/Ward proxy,  \n(5) regulator/truncation sensitivity report.\n\nAll tolerances below are defined as **internal-consistency / robustness thresholds** rather than absolute “truth” targets, because COSMO memory does not provide fixed community normalizations or numerical reference values.\n\n---\n\n### Observable O1 — Two-point (2-pt) correlator proxy (“graviton/2-pt proxy”)\n\n**Motivation grounding (from memory):**\n- COSMO notes a cross-program push toward **QFT-like observables** (explicitly referenced for causal sets: *entanglement entropy, in-in correlators/scattering*).\n- The spec therefore defines a program-agnostic “2-pt proxy” as a reproducible correlator-like summary statistic.\n\n**Definition (v0.1, program-agnostic):**\nReport a **normalized** two-point proxy amplitude evaluated on a declared separation grid:\n- `k_grid` OR `separation_grid` (must provide one, with units)\n- `G2_normalized[i]` values, each dimensionless\n- A single scalar summary: `G2_shape_score` (dimensionless), computed by the producer as a reproducible function of the grid values (implementation-specific; recorded in metadata).\n\n**Units:**\n- `G2_normalized`: dimensionless\n- `k_grid`: `1/length` OR `separation_grid`: `length` (explicitly state length unit, e.g., `m` if applicable; otherwise “model_units” is allowed but must be declared)\n\n**Required metadata fields (in addition to common metadata):**\n- `two_point_proxy.definition_text` (string; must describe exactly what is being correlated)\n- `two_point_proxy.grid_kind` (`\"k_grid\"` or `\"separation_grid\"`)\n- `two_point_proxy.grid_units`\n- `two_point_proxy.normalization_convention` (string; must be explicit)\n\n**Pass/Fail tolerance (robustness contract):**\nBecause gauge/scheme/coarse-graining can shift correlators, the benchmark checks **stability** under a declared “paired run” differing only in one technical choice (gauge OR regulator OR truncation):\n- Producer MUST provide `paired_comparison` describing the perturbation.\n- PASS if `|Δ G2_shape_score| <= 0.10` (dimensionless absolute tolerance)\n- FAIL otherwise.\n\n**Rationale for numeric tolerance:** v0.1 uses a coarse 10% stability criterion because COSMO memory provides no program-wide calibration constants; the goal is to detect *large* scheme dependence early.\n\n---\n\n### Observable O2 — Curvature/Volume scaling exponent (scaling diagnostic)\n\n**Motivation grounding (from memory):**\n- COSMO highlights **RG/coarse-graining** as a unifying thread (explicitly framed around 2021 cross-approach mappings, e.g. arXiv:2103.14605) and spin-foam/LQG emphasis on **continuum recovery via renormalization/coarse-graining**.\n- A minimal cross-approach diagnostic is an empirically fit **scaling exponent** between two aggregated quantities.\n\n**Definition (v0.1):**\nReport a fitted power-law exponent `alpha` from a declared relation:\n- `curvature_proxy ~ volume_proxy^alpha`\nwhere `curvature_proxy` and `volume_proxy` are **producer-defined** but must be described (textually) and recorded.\n\n**Units:**\n- `alpha`: dimensionless\n- `curvature_proxy.units`: declared string\n- `volume_proxy.units`: declared string\n\n**Required metadata:**\n- `scaling_fit.curvature_proxy_definition`\n- `scaling_fit.volume_proxy_definition`\n- `scaling_fit.fit_method` (string)\n- `scaling_fit.fit_domain` (e.g., range over which fit was done; string)\n- `scaling_fit.num_points` (integer)\n\n**Pass/Fail tolerance (internal consistency):**\nPASS if:\n- `alpha_std_err <= 0.05` (dimensionless) AND\n- the producer supplies a coarse-graining sweep with at least 2 levels and the fitted exponents satisfy:\n  - `max(alpha) - min(alpha) <= 0.10`\n\nFAIL otherwise.\n\nThis encodes COSMO’s emphasis that continuum recovery diagnostics must be robust under coarse-graining changes, not just well-fit at one scale.\n\n---\n\n### Observable O3 — Effective cosmological constant estimator (dimensionless proxy)\n\n**Motivation grounding (from memory):**\n- COSMO memory emphasizes bridging microscopic models to emergent semiclassical behavior via RG/coarse-graining. A minimal “emergent large-scale parameter” proxy is an *effective cosmological constant estimator*.\n- No numeric target is assumed; we only test **stability and reporting discipline**.\n\n**Definition (v0.1):**\nReport `Lambda_eff_hat`, a **dimensionless** estimator, plus `sign` and `estimation_text`.\n- If producer has a dimensionful `Λ_eff`, they must also report the conversion used to make it dimensionless (recorded in metadata).\n\n**Units:**\n- `Lambda_eff_hat`: dimensionless\n- If providing `Lambda_eff_dimensionful`, units must be stated.\n\n**Required metadata:**\n- `lambda_estimator.definition_text`\n- `lambda_estimator.dimensionless_conversion` (string; may be `\"n/a\"` if already dimensionless)\n- `lambda_estimator.data_source` (`simulation` / `analysis` / `experiment_like` / `toy_model`)\n\n**Pass/Fail tolerance (regulator sensitivity):**\nA paired run must vary **regulator OR trunc","format":"markdown","metadata":{"author":"COSMO Document Agent","createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:53:40.878Z","mode":"memory_based","memoryNodesUsed":16,"formattedAt":"2025-12-22T21:53:40.878Z"},"filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766440379610_i565e17/agent_1766440379610_i565e17_report_01.md","wordCount":996,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:53:40.880Z","version":"1.0.0","deliverablePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766440379610_i565e17/agent_1766440379610_i565e17_report_01.md","metadataPath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766440379610_i565e17/agent_1766440379610_i565e17_report_01_metadata.json"},"metadata":{"type":"report","title":"Generated report","filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766440379610_i565e17/agent_1766440379610_i565e17_report_01.md","wordCount":996,"filesCreated":1,"status":"complete","createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:53:40.880Z"}},"metadata":{"type":"report","title":"Generated report","filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766440379610_i565e17/agent_1766440379610_i565e17_report_01.md","wordCount":996,"filesCreated":1,"status":"complete","createdAt":"2025-12-22T21:53:40.880Z"},"queuedAt":"2025-12-22T21:53:41.842Z","processed":false,"integrated":false}

fixed seed(s), pinned config, pinned container/env\n   - write results to a fresh directory (e.g., `/tmp/run_<gitsha>/outputs`)\n2. **Validate every produced artifact** against its schema:\n   - JSON → JSONSchema\n   - CSV/Parquet → expected column schema (names, dtypes, nullability)\n   - Protobuf/Avro → schema decode + required-field checks\n3. **Diff produced vs expected** (`/outputs`):\n   - file presence (missing/extra files)\n   - per-file structural diff (keys/paths/fields)\n   - content hash diff for “exact match required” artifacts\n\n#### Inputs required\n- The pipeline executable (repo at current commit) + run command\n- Deterministic run config (incl. seed)\n- Canonical expected artifacts directory: `/outputs`\n- Schema sources:\n  - `schemas/*.json` (JSONSchema) and/or `.proto/.avsc`\n  - tabular schema definitions (YAML/JSON describing columns/dtypes)\n- A mapping of artifact → schema + diff strategy (e.g., `artifact_manifest.yaml`)\n- Runtime environment parity (Docker image or lockfiles)\n\n#### Tests to run (executable)\n- `run_pipeline --config config.yaml --seed 123 --out /tmp/run_$SHA/outputs`\n- `validate_outputs --manifest artifact_manifest.yaml --dir /tmp/run_$SHA/outputs`\n- `compare_outputs --expected /outputs --actual /tmp/run_$SHA/outputs --manifest artifact_manifest.yaml --out mismatches.json`\n\n#### Outputs that answer the goal\n- `mismatches.json` (machine-readable ledger), one record per mismatch:\n  - `artifact_path`, `mismatch_type` ∈ {missing_file, extra_file, schema_violation, missing_field, extra_field, value_diff}\n  - `json_pointer/column_name`, `expected`, `actual`, `diff_summary`\n  - `repro` command, git SHA, runtime info\n- `mismatches.html` (optional) summary table for quick triage\n- Archived run artifacts + logs for reproduction\n\n---\n\n### Experiment 2 — Numerical diff characterization + tolerance sweep\n**Purpose:** Separate true logic regressions from precision/tolerance issues by quantifying numeric deltas and testing which tolerances would make outputs match.\n\n#### What computation/code to run\n1. For every numeric mismatch from Experiment 1:\n   - compute `abs_err`, `rel_err`, ULP distance (if float), and distribution summaries per field\n2. Run a **tolerance sweep** to see at what tolerance mismatches disappear:\n   - e.g., `rtol ∈ {0, 1e-12, 1e-9, 1e-6, 1e-3}`, `atol ∈ {0, 1e-12, 1e-9, 1e-6}`\n3. Optionally rerun pipeline twice to detect nondeterminism:\n   - if outputs differ between identical runs → likely nondeterminism/precision instability\n\n#### Inputs required\n- `mismatches.json` from Experiment 1\n- Numeric tolerance policy (current spec or proposed defaults)\n- Access to both expected `/outputs` and actual outputs directory\n\n#### Tests to run (executable)\n- `analyze_numeric_diffs --expected /outputs --actual /tmp/run_$SHA/outputs --mismatches mismatches.json --out numeric_report.json`\n- `tolerance_sweep --expected /outputs --actual /tmp/run_$SHA/outputs --grid tolerances.yaml --out tolerance_matrix.json`\n- (optional) second identical run: `/tmp/run_$SHA2/outputs` and compare run1 vs run2\n\n#### Outputs that answer the goal\n- `numeric_report.json`: per-field numeric error metrics + top offenders\n- `tolerance_matrix.json`: which mismatches resolve under which (rtol, atol)\n- Classification hint per numeric mismatch:\n  - **tolerance/precision** if within agreed tolerance band or varies across identical runs\n  - otherwise likely **implementation bug** (or **spec bug** if spec defines different rounding/units)\n\n---\n\n### Experiment 3 — Automated issue creation + categorization (spec vs implementation vs tolerance)\n**Purpose:** Convert each mismatch into a tracked issue with consistent categorization and enough context to reproduce.\n\n#### What computation/code to run\n1. **Normalize + group mismatches** to avoid issue spam:\n   - group by `(artifact_path, json_pointer/column, mismatch_type)` and aggregate occurrences\n2. **Auto-categorize** with explicit rules + “needs-human” fallback:\n   - **schema_violation / missing_field**\n     - if artifact fails *declared schema* → **implementation bug** (unless schema contradicts spec doc)\n     - if schema appears too strict vs documented spec → **spec bug**\n   - **value_diff (numeric)**\n     - if resolved by approved tolerance (from Exp. 2) → **tolerance/precision issue**\n     - else → **implementation bug** (unless spec ambiguity about rounding/units)\n   - **missing_file/extra_file**\n     - if manifest/spec expects it → **implementation bug**\n     - if manifest/spec outdated → **spec bug**\n3. **Create issues via API** (GitHub/Jira):\n   - title template: `[pipeline mismatch] <artifact> <path> <type>`\n   - include: expected vs actual snippet, diff summary, tolerance metrics, repro command, links to logs/artifacts\n   - add labels: `spec-bug` / `implementation-bug` / `tolerance-precision`, plus `schema`, `numeric`, `missing-field`, etc.\n\n#### Inputs required\n- `mismatches.json`, `numeric_report.json`, `tolerance_matrix.json`\n- Spec references (URLs/paths) used in issue templates\n- Issue tracker credentials (token) + project/repo target\n- Label taxonomy and mapping rules (a small config file)\n\n#### Tests to run (executable)\n- Dry run: `create_issues --dry-run --mismatches mismatches.json --numeric numeric_report.json --out issue_preview.json`\n- Real run: `create_issues --apply --tracker github --repo org/repo --token $TOKEN --preview issue_preview.json`\n\n#### Outputs that answer the goal\n- `issue_preview.json`: exact issues that would be created + assigned category\n- Created issue list: `created_issues.json` containing tracker IDs/URLs, labels, and linked mismatch IDs\n- A final summary report:\n  - counts by category (spec vs implementation vs tolerance)\n  - top failing artifacts/fields\n  - % resolved by tolerance changes vs true regressions\n\n---\n\n## Minimal deliverables to consider the goal met\n1. A reproducible run directory for the current pipeline (`/tmp/run_<sha>/outputs`) and a **complete mismatch ledger** (`mismatches.json`).\n2. A numeric tolerance analysis (`numeric_report.json`, `tolerance_matrix.json`) that clearly separates precision noise from substantive diffs.\n3.

print([m.name for m in pkgutil.iter_modules()])\"` (run from repo root in a venv)\n3. **Build artifacts to see what would ship**\n   - `python -m build` (or your tool: `poetry build`, `hatch build`)\n   - Inspect wheel/sdist contents:\n     - `python -c \"import zipfile; z=zipfile.ZipFile('dist/' + __import__('glob').glob('*.whl')[0]); print('\\n'.join(z.namelist()[:200]))\"`\n4. **Run baseline checks**\n   - `python -m pip install -e .`\n   - `python -m pytest` (or existing test command)\n   - `python -m compileall -q .`\n   - If lint/type checks exist: `ruff check .` / `flake8` / `mypy` etc.\n\n**Data collected / outputs:**\n- A list of importable top-level modules/packages\n- The wheel/sdist file listing (what is currently packaged)\n- Current test/lint status (pass/fail + errors)\n- Concrete evidence of whether imports rely on repo-root being on `sys.path` (a common reason to adopt `src/`)\n\n**Decision criteria supported by outputs:**\n- If imports/tests currently succeed only because repo root is on `sys.path`, `src/` layout is typically safer.\n- If the project is intentionally a single-module or very small package and already well-isolated, flat may be acceptable.\n- The artifact inspection tells you which files are unintentionally included/excluded today.\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 2 — Layout migration trial (choose one canonical layout, then implement in a branch)\n**Purpose:** Validate the chosen canonical layout by actually moving/merging generated files, fixing imports/entrypoints, and proving the repo builds and tests in editable + wheel installs.\n\n**Steps (executable):**\n1. **Create a migration branch**\n   - `git checkout -b chore/layout-migration`\n2. **Apply chosen layout**\n   - **If `src/` layout:**\n     - Create `src/<package_name>/...` and move package code under `src/`\n     - Ensure only packages live under `src/` (no random scripts)\n   - **If flat layout:**\n     - Ensure there is a single clear top-level package directory `<package_name>/`\n     - Remove/merge duplicated generated sources into the canonical directory\n3. **Move/merge generated files**\n   - Run the generator (if applicable) or move the generated outputs into their canonical location\n   - Ensure generator output paths match the new layout (update generator config/scripts)\n4. **Update packaging config & entrypoints**\n   - Setuptools example:\n     - `pyproject.toml`: configure `package-dir = {\"\" = \"src\"}` (for `src/` layout)\n     - Ensure `packages = find:` or equivalent finds correct packages\n   - Update console scripts entrypoints to match new module paths\n   - Update `python -m ...` entry module locations if changed\n5. **Fix imports**\n   - Mechanically update import paths:\n     - `python -m compileall -q .` to catch syntax/import errors\n     - (Optional) use a refactoring tool if present (e.g., `ruff --fix` where applicable)\n6. **Prove correctness in both editable and wheel installs**\n   - `python -m pip uninstall -y <project_name>`\n   - `python -m pip install -e .`\n   - `python -m pytest`\n   - `python -m pip uninstall -y <project_name>`\n   - `python -m build`\n   - `python -m pip install dist/*.whl`\n   - `python -c \"import <package_name>; print(<package_name>.__file__)\"`\n   - `python -m pytest`\n\n**Data collected / outputs:**\n- Git diff showing the canonical structure (moves/renames, config edits)\n- Editable install test results (ensures dev workflow works)\n- Wheel install test results (ensures packaged distribution works)\n- Verified import resolution from installed wheel (critical for `src/` correctness)\n\n**Pass/fail criteria:**\n- All tests pass in both editable install and wheel install scenarios\n- No missing modules in built artifacts\n- Entrypoints run correctly (if applicable)\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 3 — CI confirmation run + stability check (post-migration)\n**Purpose:** Ensure the merged structure is stable under CI and not dependent on local environment quirks.\n\n**Steps (executable):**\n1. **Run the same commands CI runs, locally if possible**\n   - Use `tox`/`nox` if CI is driven by them; otherwise mirror CI steps manually\n2. **Trigger CI on the migration branch**\n   - Push branch and open PR (or manually trigger workflow)\n3. **Add a guardrail test (optional but recommended)**\n   - Add a packaging sanity check job/step:\n     - Build wheel\n     - Install wheel into a fresh environment\n     - Run a smoke import + minimal command execution (e.g., CLI `--help`)\n\n**Data collected / outputs:**\n- CI results: pass/fail across supported OS/Python versions\n- Logs confirming wheel build/install is used (not just repo-root execution)\n- Evidence the final structure is stable and repeatable\n\n**Pass/fail criteria:**\n- CI green with the new layout\n- No environment-specific import behavior (e.g., tests passing only because working directory is repo root)\n\n---\n\n## Final deliverables that answer the GOAL\n1. **Decision record:** A short document (e.g., `docs/layout.md` or `ADR-xxx.md`) stating:\n   - Chosen canonical layout (`src/` vs flat) and rationale based on Experiment 1 results\n   - Rules for generated files (where they live, how to regenerate, what gets committed)\n2. **Merged repository structure:** Code + generated artifacts moved/merged into canonical locations\n3. **Updated imports/entrypoints:** Verified by editable + wheel install tests\n4. **CI confirmation:** Green CI run demonstrating stability after the merge\n\nIf you share the repo’s current tree and packaging config (`pyproject.toml`/`setup.cfg`), I can tailor the exact commands and the most likely layout choice before you run Experiment 2.","reasoning":""},"executionResults":[{"timestamp":"2025-12-22T22:01:45.291Z","content":"I executed **Experiment 1 (baseline inventory)** in the current execution environment, but **no repository is present here** (there’s no `.git` directory and no `pyproject.toml` / `setup.cfg` / `setup.py` found), so the plan can’t be meaningfully run beyond detection/guardrails.\n\n### Results (this environment)\n- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` failed with:\n  - `fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`\n- Therefore, the following were **skipped/not executable** here:\n  - `git status`, `git ls-files`, packaging inventory\n  - build (`python -m build`) and wheel inspection\n  - editable install (`pip install -e .`)\n  - tests/lint discovery and execution\n- Visualization: not generated because there were no repo files to analyze.\n\n### Artifacts produced\n- A structured JSON report capturing the attempted steps and the reason execution stopped:\n  - [Download Experiment 1 report (JSON)](sandbox:/mnt/data/layout_migration_experiment1_report.json)\n\n### What I need from you to run Experiments 1–3 and return real results\nUpload the repository into this environment (e.g., a zip), or point me to the repo folder name under `/mnt/data`.\n\nIf you upload a zip, I can:\n1.

If unclear, discover via `python -c \"import importlib.metadata as m; print(m.distribution('<name>').entry_points)\"` after install.\n- Clean Python runtime available (recommend: Python 3.11+), plus `git`.\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 1 — Clean environment install + reproducibility capture\n**Purpose:** Prove the package installs cleanly with editable install and capture environment metadata for reproducibility.\n\n**Steps (executable):**\n1. Create a fresh virtualenv inside the scaffold:\n   ```bash\n   cd outputs/benchmark-repo\n   python -m venv .venv\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n   python -m pip install -U pip wheel setuptools\n   ```\n2. Editable install (canonical requirement):\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e . | tee artifacts/install.log\n   ```\n3. Capture reproducibility metadata:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p artifacts\n   python -V | tee artifacts/python_version.txt\n   pip --version | tee artifacts/pip_version.txt\n   pip freeze | tee artifacts/pip_freeze.txt\n   uname -a | tee artifacts/uname.txt 2>/dev/null || true\n   git rev-parse HEAD | tee artifacts/git_head.txt\n   ```\n\n**Outputs that satisfy this experiment:**\n- `artifacts/install.log`\n- `artifacts/python_version.txt`, `artifacts/pip_version.txt`, `artifacts/pip_freeze.txt`, `artifacts/uname.txt`, `artifacts/git_head.txt`\n\n**Pass criteria:**\n- `pip install -e .` exits 0\n- Metadata files are generated\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 2 — Schema validation of examples\n**Purpose:** Validate that all example JSON files conform to the project schema (as required).\n\n**Steps (choose the project’s canonical method):**\n- If the repo provides a schema-validation CLI or script (preferred), run it and log output:\n  ```bash\n  # Example (replace with actual command):\n  python -m benchmark_repo validate-schema examples/*.json | tee artifacts/schema_validate.log\n  ```\n- If validation is documented via `jsonschema`/`check-jsonschema`, install and run explicitly (only if repo lacks its own validator):\n  ```bash\n  pip install check-jsonschema\n  check-jsonschema --schemafile path/to/schema.json examples/*.json | tee artifacts/schema_validate.log\n  ```\n\n**Outputs:**\n- `artifacts/schema_validate.log`\n\n**Pass criteria:**\n- Validation command exits 0\n- Log shows all examples validated successfully\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 3 — End-to-end CLI run on benchmark_case_001 + deterministic comparison\n**Purpose:** Run the CLI on the canonical input and compare produced output to the expected JSON, capturing full logs and diff artifacts. Confirm determinism by running twice.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Run CLI on the target example, capture stdout/stderr, and write output JSON to artifacts:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p artifacts/run_001\n   # Replace <cli-command> with the actual invocation.\n   <cli-command> examples/benchmark_case_001.json \\\n     --output artifacts/run_001/benchmark_case_001.actual.json \\\n     1> artifacts/run_001/stdout.log \\\n     2> artifacts/run_001/stderr.log\n   ```\n2. Normalize JSON (to avoid key-order/whitespace issues) and diff against expected:\n   ```bash\n   python - <<'PY'\n   import json, sys, pathlib\n   def norm(p):\n       obj=json.loads(pathlib.Path(p).read_text())\n       return json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, indent=2) + \"\\n\"\n   pathlib.Path(\"artifacts/run_001/actual.normalized.json\").write_text(norm(\"artifacts/run_001/benchmark_case_001.actual.json\"))\n   pathlib.Path(\"artifacts/run_001/expected.normalized.json\").write_text(norm(\"expected/benchmark_case_001.expected.json\"))\n   PY\n\n   diff -u artifacts/run_001/expected.normalized.json artifacts/run_001/actual.normalized.json \\\n     | tee artifacts/run_001/diff.patch\n   ```\n3. Determinism check: re-run and compare the two normalized outputs:\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p artifacts/run_002\n   <cli-command> examples/benchmark_case_001.json \\\n     --output artifacts/run_002/benchmark_case_001.actual.json \\\n     1> artifacts/run_002/stdout.log \\\n     2> artifacts/run_002/stderr.log\n\n   python - <<'PY'\n   import json, pathlib\n   def norm(p):\n       obj=json.loads(pathlib.Path(p).read_text())\n       return json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, indent=2) + \"\\n\"\n   pathlib.Path(\"artifacts/run_002/actual.normalized.json\").write_text(norm(\"artifacts/run_002/benchmark_case_001.actual.json\"))\n   PY\n\n   diff -u artifacts/run_001/actual.normalized.json artifacts/run_002/actual.normalized.json \\\n     | tee artifacts/determinism.diff.patch\n   ```\n\n**Outputs:**\n- `artifacts/run_001/benchmark_case_001.actual.json`\n- `artifacts/run_001/stdout.log`, `artifacts/run_001/stderr.log`\n- `artifacts/run_001/actual.normalized.json`, `artifacts/run_001/expected.normalized.json`\n- `artifacts/run_001/diff.patch` (empty diff = success)\n- `artifacts/run_002/*` and `artifacts/determinism.diff.patch` (empty diff = deterministic)\n\n**Pass criteria:**\n- CLI exits 0\n- `diff.patch` is empty (or diff command exits 0)\n- `determinism.diff.patch` is empty\n\n---\n\n## Finalization — Commit reproducible artifacts\n**Purpose:** Ensure logs/artifacts are versioned for reproducibility.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Add artifacts (assuming project policy allows committing them; otherwise commit only summaries):\n   ```bash\n   git add artifacts/ expected/ examples/\n   git status\n   git commit -m \"Add end-to-end benchmark_case_001 validation artifacts and logs\"\n   ```\n2. Optional: add a single command runner (recommended) to re-run all experiments:\n   - Create `scripts/e2e_validate.sh` or `Makefile` target that performs Experiments 1–3.\n\n**Outputs that answer the goal (overall):**\n- A clean-environment install log + environment manifests\n- Schema-validation logs confirming examples are valid\n- CLI run logs + actual output JSON\n- A recorded diff vs expected (proving correctness)\n- Determinism diff (proving reproducibility)\n- All artifacts committed (or otherwise captured) under `outputs/benchmark-repo/artifacts/`","reasoning":""},"executionResults":[{"timestamp":"2025-12-22T22:02:06.491Z","content":"The plan could not be executed because the required repository scaffold is not present in this runtime.\n\n### What happened (result)\n- Searched for the required repo directory at:\n  - `./outputs/benchmark-repo`\n  - `/mnt/data/outputs/benchmark-repo`\n  - plus a bounded recursive search under the current working directory and `/mnt/data`\n- **Result:** `outputs/benchmark-repo/` was **not found**, so Experiments 1–3 (venv install, schema validation, CLI run/diff/determinism) cannot run.\n\n### Artifacts produced (from this attempted run)\nThese capture the failure state and a simple status visualization:\n\n- [Download status.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/e2e_validation_report/status.json)\n- [Download status_plot.png](sandbox:/mnt/data/e2e_validation_report/status_plot.png)\n\n### How to proceed\nIf you upload/provide the repository contents in this environment (so that `outputs/benchmark-repo/` exists with `examples/` and `expected/`), I can re-run the exact plan end-to-end and generate the requested logs/diffs under `outputs/benchmark-repo/artifacts/`.","reasoning":"","codeResults":[],"hadError":false}],"insights":["**The canonical scaffold was missing**, so the end-to-end plan could not run.

The section ends by stating the review’s core question: **what is the status (2020–2025) of identifying universal continuum physics from background-independent microscopic models, and how do different programs operationalize that identification?**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Unifying thread: RG and coarse graining as a cross-program “translation layer”\nA central finding from the memory nodes is that **RG/coarse-graining ideas are explicitly presented (circa 2021 special-issue framing)** as a unifying thread across quantum-gravity programs, with the shared aim of relating microscopic spacetime models to emergent semiclassical behavior and, ultimately, phenomenology. This section formalizes that thread into a “translation layer” that can be used across otherwise disparate frameworks. The goal is not to impose a single definition of RG, but to show how each program substitutes for the role played by scale separation and coarse graining in standard quantum field theory.\n\nA key technical point arising in background-independent contexts is that **geometric length scales are not fundamental inputs**. Instead, background-independent RG replaces physical length with measures tied to underlying degrees of freedom. A concrete instance provided is the framing in tensor models: **background-independent RG replaces geometric length scales with quantities like tensor size/rank**, and **fixed points** are interpreted as candidates for **universal continuum limits** (explicitly referenced to Eichhorn–Koslowski–Pereira 2018, arXiv:1811.12909). This provides a template: define a notion of “effective description” along a refinement/coarsening hierarchy; compute flows of couplings/weights under that change of description; search for fixed points and critical surfaces; and interpret universality as independence from microscopic details.\n\nWe also incorporate a methodological motif that recurs in the discrete approaches discussed: **phase diagrams and critical behavior** are used as practical markers of continuum physics, especially when analytic control is limited and numerical tools dominate. The review will therefore build a shared vocabulary: “continuum limit candidate,” “emergent semiclassical regime,” “effective diffeomorphism symmetry restoration,” and “universality class,” and will use it consistently across spin foams, CDT, tensor models, and related discrete formulations. The section ends by outlining why tensor-network ideas appear naturally here: they provide constructive coarse-graining schemes when the fundamental objects are combinatorial/discrete, and they can serve as diagnostics for whether RG steps are approaching a fixed point compatible with semiclassical geometry.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Spin-foam loop quantum gravity: from kinematics to continuum recovery (2018–2025)\nThe knowledge base identifies a specific trend: **spin-foam LQG (2018–2025)** has shifted emphasis from primarily kinematical results toward **continuum recovery via background-independent renormalization and coarse graining**. This section reviews that shift as a change in the center of gravity of the field—toward diagnosing and constructing continuum limits and toward understanding how effective spacetime symmetries, especially diffeomorphism symmetry, can re-emerge.\n\nTwo concrete developments anchor the narrative. First, coarse graining in spin foams is increasingly framed as **explicit refinement/coarsening maps between complexes**, and progress is organized around **RG flows defined via boundary data**. This is a distinctive, program-specific operationalization: instead of RG defined by momentum shells in a background metric, the RG transformation is implemented through changes in discretization/complex while tracking how amplitudes or effective descriptions transform on boundaries. Second, there is explicit emphasis on **practical numerical and tensor-network renormalization schemes**, including **tensor network renormalization for spin nets/foams**, as tools to compute and explore these flows.\n\nThe section will then connect these techniques to the key physics targets: identifying **fixed points** (as continuum limit candidates), characterizing their universality properties, and diagnosing whether the resulting large-scale behavior matches expectations for semiclassical geometry. The memory nodes also emphasize a specific aim: tensor-network-inspired methods are used to **diagnose continuum limits and restore effective diffeomorphism symmetry**. Accordingly, the review will treat “effective diffeomorphism symmetry restoration” as a primary diagnostic for success: coarse graining should not merely produce stable flows, but flows consistent with the reappearance of the gauge symmetry structure associated with continuum GR.\n\nFinally, we will highlight the importance of “signals” of RG structure in the spin-foam setting. A representative example explicitly provided is a **Physical Review Letters** reference (PhysRevLett.117.141302) cited as a “representative spin-foam RG signal.” This section uses that as a signpost for the broader development: the field is increasingly defined by the ability to compute and interpret RG behavior—not merely define kinematics.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Discrete quantum gravity via phase structure: CDT and the logic of continuum limits\nDiscrete approaches increasingly use **phase diagrams and critical behavior (often numerically)** as proxies for identifying **continuum limits** and for locating **emergent semiclassical regimes**. This section uses **causal dynamical triangulations (CDT)** as the clearest example explicitly present in the knowledge base, anchored by the cited CDT review **arXiv:1905.08669**. The guiding logic is pragmatic: when a microscopic model is defined as a sum over discrete geometries, the continuum theory is expected to emerge near critical points in parameter space where correlation lengths (or their background-independent analogues) diverge, and where universal large-scale behavior becomes insensitive to microscopic details.\n\nThe section will explain how CDT fits into the review’s unifying RG/coarse-graining lens even when the primary tools are numerical. Phase structure becomes the “RG laboratory”: mapping phases and identifying phase transitions substitutes for analytic RG flows in many settings. The review will emphasize the role of **critical behavior** as a proxy for continuum physics: critical points are interpreted as candidates where the discrete theory can be tuned to produce continuum observables, and extended “semiclassical” regions in the phase diagram serve as candidate macroscopic spacetime regimes.\n\nThe section then draws an explicit bridge to spin foams: the same proxy logic—**phase diagrams and criticality as continuum markers**—also appears in spin-foam RG/coarse graining developments. This parallel is one of the most important cross-program connections in the memory nodes: it suggests that even when underlying degrees of freedom and amplitudes differ drastically, the operational definition of “progress toward continuum spacetime” is converging on shared diagnostics.\n\nFinally, the section will position CDT within the broader “discrete RG” storyline: CDT provides a prominent, mature case where numerical phase structure is central, and therefore functions as a benchmark for how far other discrete approaches might push analogous phase-diagram-driven continuum searches.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Background-independent RG in tensor models (and adjacent combinatorial frameworks)\nA distinctive contribution from the memory nodes is the explicit formulation of **background-independent RG** in tensor models: rather than using geometric length as an RG parameter, one uses measures tied to the fundamental degrees of freedom, and interprets fixed points as continuum limit candidates.

Research question (diagnostic-first)\nHow do **spin-foam** and **group field theory (GFT)** coarse-graining pipelines compare when judged purely by **continuum-recovery observables and scaling metrics**, under a **single cross-validated diagnostic framework**?\n\nThis directly instantiates COSMO’s consolidated direction:\n- prioritize **continuum-recovery observables and scaling metrics**\n- make coarse-graining/tensor-network approaches **mutually comparable**\n- support with **prototype numerical/symbolic toy experiments** (Items **1**, **2**)\n\n## A2. Methods\n\n### A2.1 Data model and IO normalization\nWe assume each approach produces a log of iterative coarse-graining / RG steps. We do not assume a shared native format. Instead, we normalize into the `rg_io.py` abstract structure:\n\n- dataset = ordered list of `steps`\n- each step contains:\n  - **scale information**\n  - **couplings/parameters**\n  - **observables**\n  - optional **distributional payloads**\n\nThis is explicitly what `rg_io.py` was created to do. (Item **4**, Item **20**)\n\n**Implementation hook:** `sf_gft_diagnostics.rg_io` will host adapters:\n- `load_spinfoam_log(...)`\n- `load_gft_log(...)`\n- `to_step_sequence(...)`\n\n(Names are illustrative skeleton entrypoints; the key is that `rg_io.py` is the normalization layer per item **4**.)\n\n### A2.2 Diagnostics: observables, scaling, metrics\nUsing `sf_gft_diagnostics` modules (Item **20**):\n\n- **Observables**: computed or re-keyed from logs into a consistent observable namespace (from `observables.py`).\n- **Scaling**: fit scaling behavior across coarse-graining steps; if discretization parameters exist, allow extrapolation routines (from `scaling.py`).\n- **Metrics**: compare stability/consistency of flows, distances between trajectories, collapse under rescaling, etc. (from `metrics.py`).\n- **Benchmarks**: use synthetic/blinded benchmark datasets (from `benchmarks.py`) to validate the pipeline and enable fair cross-code comparison. This aligns with COSMO’s instruction to share blinded synthetic data to diagnose systematics (Item **3**).\n- **Reporting**: standardized tables/plots/artifacts (from `reporting.py`). (Item **20**)\n\n### A2.3 Cross-validation protocol (the “benchmark sandwich”)\n1. **Unit-test stage**: run on toy RG flows (generated) to verify invariances and that scaling fits recover planted exponents.\n2. **Blinded synthetic stage**: two synthetic datasets, one labelled “spin-foam-like” and one “GFT-like”, with hidden parameter differences. Analysts only see the normalized step sequence.\n3. **Real-log stage** (if/when available): ingest actual logs; preserve the same diagnostics and reporting.\n\nThis directly uses COSMO’s method: *“Share a small set of benchmark ensembles and blinded synthetic data between codes so cross-program differences diagnose residual systematics rather than analysis or scale choices.”* (Item **3**)\n\n### A2.4 Continuum / infinite-volume extrapolation (if the data provide \\(a\\), \\(L\\))\nWhere multiple lattice spacings/volumes exist (or are emulated), apply COSMO’s specified best practice (Item **3**):\n\n- **Global fits across multiple lattice spacings and volumes**\n- Fit to **Symanzik-m","format":"markdown","metadata":{"author":"COSMO Document Agent","createdAt":"2025-12-22T22:11:29.649Z","mode":"memory_based","memoryNodesUsed":27,"formattedAt":"2025-12-22T22:11:29.649Z"},"filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766441446722_z74ys2j/agent_1766441446722_z74ys2j_report_01.md","wordCount":1022,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T22:11:29.652Z","version":"1.0.0","deliverablePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766441446722_z74ys2j/agent_1766441446722_z74ys2j_report_01.md","metadataPath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766441446722_z74ys2j/agent_1766441446722_z74ys2j_report_01_metadata.json"},"metadata":{"type":"report","title":"Generated report","filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766441446722_z74ys2j/agent_1766441446722_z74ys2j_report_01.md","wordCount":1022,"filesCreated":1,"status":"complete","createdAt":"2025-12-22T22:11:29.652Z"}},"metadata":{"type":"report","title":"Generated report","filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766441446722_z74ys2j/agent_1766441446722_z74ys2j_report_01.md","wordCount":1022,"filesCreated":1,"status":"complete","createdAt":"2025-12-22T22:11:29.652Z"},"queuedAt":"2025-12-22T22:11:32.944Z","processed":false,"integrated":false}

COSMO’s unifying aim (item **1**) is to make different coarse‑graining/tensor‑network approaches **mutually comparable** by prioritizing:\n\n- **continuum‑recovery observables** and\n- **scaling metrics**,  \nwith cross‑validated diagnostics.\n\n**The comparison in this case study is not “which theory is correct,”** but:  \n> Do two coarse‑graining pipelines (one producing “spin‑foam‑style” logs, one “GFT‑style” logs) yield consistent continuum‑recovery scaling diagnostics under the same normalization and inference protocol?\n\nThis is explicitly aligned with COSMO’s limitation statement: small observable sets can’t decisively discriminate theories; the goal is a **robustness contract** across scheme/regulator/coarse‑graining choices (memory item **5**).\n\n## A2. Methods\n\n### A2.1 Data model: normalize both pipelines into a single step schema\nUse `sf_gft_diagnostics.rg_io` to ingest two heterogeneous sources:\n\n- **Spin‑foam coarse‑graining log** (synthetic or imported, but recorded in a deterministic JSON/CSV form).\n- **GFT coarse‑graining / RG log** (synthetic or imported similarly).\n\nThen normalize into the “sequence of steps” concept from memory item **4**:\n- step index,\n- scale metadata,\n- couplings/parameters,\n- observables,\n- optional distribution payloads.\n\nThis enables common downstream diagnostics.\n\n### A2.2 Diagnostics: continuum recovery as scaling + extrapolation\nCompute (from `sf_gft_diagnostics.observables`, `scaling`, `metrics`):\n\n- **Scaling metrics** across coarse‑graining steps (how observables evolve with step/scale).\n- **Continuum/infinite-volume extrapolations** using COSMO’s prescribed global‑fit approach (item **3**):\n  - multi‑resolution/multi‑volume fits,\n  - Symanzik‑motivated continuum + finite‑volume ansatz,\n  - correlated covariance propagation,\n  - shared scale setting (example: \\(w_0/t_0\\), used here only as an explicit scale-setting *example* from memory—if not available in a dataset, the case study uses a stand‑in “nonperturbative scale” variable but documents the substitution).\n\n### A2.3 Robustness protocol: blinded synthetic ensembles + cross-code comparison\nPer item **3**, create:\n- “blinded” synthetic datasets representing outputs of each pipeline under varying regulator/coarse‑graining choices.\n- Evaluate whether the inferred continuum targets and scaling exponents are stable within tolerance bands and whether residuals exhibit scheme sensitivity.\n\nUse numeric comparison tools (memory item **30**: `numeric_compare.py`, `benchmark_compare.py`) to:\n- compare derived metrics across runs,\n- enforce tolerance policies, and\n- generate a pass/fail section in the benchmark JSON output.\n\n### A2.4 Reproducibility & CI\nAdhere to COSMO’s artifact engineering requirements (item **6**):\n- deterministic I/O,\n- explicit schema validation (pre‑commit/CI gate per memory),\n- metadata collection (script in memory item **29** suggests `record_benchmark_metadata.py` exists),\n- golden outputs for regression.\n\n## A3. Expected results (what this case study is designed to show)\nBecause COSMO memory does **not** include program-specific amplitude formulas or known numerical targets, “expected results” are expressed as **diagnostic outcomes**:\n\n1. **Successful normalization**: both spin‑foam and GFT logs can be mapped into a common step-based representation without losing required scale/coupling/observable context (item **4**).\n2. **Comparable scaling curves**: once normalized, derived scaling metrics can be plotted/compared across pipelines using the same functions.\n3. **Continuum-extrapolation stability**: global fits across multiple resolutions/volumes produce continuum estimates that are:\n   - stable under resampling,\n   - sensitive in traceable ways to regulator/coarse‑","format":"markdown","metadata":{"author":"COSMO Document Agent","createdAt":"2025-12-22T22:12:51.308Z","mode":"memory_based","memoryNodesUsed":30,"formattedAt":"2025-12-22T22:12:51.308Z"},"filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766441526699_g06rkmy/agent_1766441526699_g06rkmy_report_01.md","wordCount":1040,"createdAt":"2025-12-22T22:12:51.312Z","version":"1.0.0","deliverablePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766441526699_g06rkmy/agent_1766441526699_g06rkmy_report_01.md","metadataPath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766441526699_g06rkmy/agent_1766441526699_g06rkmy_report_01_metadata.json"},"metadata":{"type":"report","title":"Generated report","filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766441526699_g06rkmy/agent_1766441526699_g06rkmy_report_01.md","wordCount":1040,"filesCreated":1,"status":"complete","createdAt":"2025-12-22T22:12:51.312Z"}},"metadata":{"type":"report","title":"Generated report","filePath":"/Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/runtime/outputs/document-creation/agent_1766441526699_g06rkmy/agent_1766441526699_g06rkmy_report_01.md","wordCount":1040,"filesCreated":1,"status":"complete","createdAt":"2025-12-22T22:12:51.312Z"},"queuedAt":"2025-12-22T22:12:52.222Z","processed":false,"integrated":false}

Below are areas of agreement, the actual conflicts/tensions, and a concise recommended synthesis and next actions.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Semiclassical propagation is a valuable middle ground between fully classical and fully quantum dynamics: it can capture phase/interference effects missing from classical trajectories and is often more scalable than full quantum methods.\n- A useful assessment requires direct comparison to exact quantum benchmarks across controlled parameters (effective ħ, coupling strength, temperature, timescale).\n- Fidelity-type diagnostics (state overlap, observable convergence) and phase-space metrics (Wigner distance, phase coherence) are the right kinds of measures to quantify semiclassical performance.\n- Dynamical instability (chaos) matters strongly: divergence rates limit times for reliable semiclassical/classical–quantum correspondence, so Lyapunov-related diagnostics should be included in any benchmark analysis.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- “Unified benchmark” claim: Branch 1 treats semiclassical methods themselves as a unified benchmark to quantify classical failure and required quantum corrections. Branch 3 instead proposes an open benchmark suite that systematically compares multiple semiclassical variants to exact quantum solutions. These are complementary but different roles — one treats semiclassics as the standard, the other treats them as the subject to be tested.\n- Single-metric vs multi-metric: Branch 2 advocates a single predictive curve (Lyapunov spectrum → Ehrenfest-time window → fidelity decay → decoherence) as a unified metric. That is attractive but optimistic: complex systems exhibit multiple failure modes (tunneling, caustics, strong nonadiabatic coupling, finite-temperature baths) that cannot always be collapsed to a single Lyapunov-derived curve. Branch 3’s multi-problem, multi-metric approach is more robust.\n- Practical scalability and accuracy limits: Branch 1’s emphasis on scalability and “capturing essential coherence” risks underplaying known limits of semiclassical methods (breakdown at long times beyond Ehrenfest time, caustics, strong coupling to baths, deep tunneling). Branches 2 and 3 implicitly acknowledge limits but differ in how they propose to measure/predict them.\n- Seeding ensembles with unstable manifolds (Branch 2) vs generic sampling: seeding on classical unstable manifolds is a principled idea to probe worst-case/chaotic directions, but it may bias assessments if not combined with broader ensembles that sample relevant phase-space regions for the physical problem (thermal distributions, reaction coordinates, etc.).\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Adopt Branch 3 as the practical framework: build an open, reproducible benchmark suite that compares multiple semiclassical methods to exact quantum dynamics across canonical model problems and parameter sweeps (ħ, temperature, coupling, time).\n  - Canonical problems: harmonic oscillator (sanity check), double well (tunneling/coherence), barrier scattering (transmission/reflection), kicked rotor (chaos), and simple system+bath models (decoherence).\n  - Methods to include: Herman–Kluk/IVR, thawed/frozen Gaussian schemes, Wigner propagation, other practical semiclassical variants; exact references: split-operator, MCTDH where feasible.\n  - Metrics: fidelity/time-dependent overlaps, Wigner distance, observable convergence (populations, currents), Ehrenfest-time estimate, runtime/complexity.\n- Incorporate Branch 2’s instability diagnostics as complementary predictive metrics:\n  - Compute Lyapunov spectra and local finite-time instability measures for each classical underlying flow.\n  - Use these to predict Ehrenfest-time windows and to design targeted semiclassical tests: (a) seed ensembles along unstable manifolds to probe maximal divergence directions; (b) compare predicted fidelity-decay time scales to observed semiclassical failure times.\n  - But do not rely on a single curve alone—report where Lyapunov-based predictions succeed/fail.\n- Treat Branch 1’s conceptual position as guidance, not dogma:\n  - Use semiclassical methods as the main, scalable surrogate for many regimes, but validate their domain of validity systematically within the suite. Make explicit where they succeed (short-to-intermediate times, moderate ħ, weak-to-moderate coupling) and where they fail (long times beyond Ehrenfest, deep tunneling, strong dissipation).\n- Deliverables / immediate next steps\n  - Define an initial minimal benchmark set (3–5 potentials, parameter grids), standard initial states, and evaluation scripts.\n  - Implement baseline runs: compute classical Lyapunov metrics, run a representative semiclassical method (e.g., Herman–Kluk) and an exact solver for each case; report times-to-failure by fidelity and by observable error.\n  - Publish code/data openly, include reproducible notebooks that show where Lyapunov-based predictions align and where they do not.\n  - Iterate: expand models, methods, and metrics based on early findings (e.g., include bath models and temperature sweeps if decoherence issues dominate).\n- Succinct metric for decision-making: use a two-tier report per case — (A) predictive metric(s): finite-time Lyapunov/Ehrenfest estimate + runtime estimate; (B) empirical benchmark: fidelity decay curve and observable error vs time. Together they give operational guidance on whether semiclassical propagation is acceptable for a given task.\n\nBottom line: merge Branch 3’s practical, open benchmark infrastructure with Branch 2’s instability-based predictive diagnostics, and adopt Branch 1’s semiclassical methods as the principal subject of the suite (not the unchallenged benchmark).

In this view, **entanglement functions as the organizing resource** and, under systematic coarse‑graining (RG flow, tensor networks, holography), **effective geometry and spacetime dynamics emerge** as macroscopic descriptions of underlying quantum information structure. This framing helps align programs that otherwise look incompatible—e.g., holographic duality, tensor‑network constructions, and other emergent‑gravity approaches—by focusing on what is preserved or discarded under scale transformations and how entanglement patterns constrain allowable effective laws.\n\nOn the constraints side, **Bell‑type results and loophole‑closed experiments sharply narrow viable “deeper than quantum” models**: any theory matching observed correlations must relinquish at least one classical assumption (strict locality, measurement independence/free choice, or simple realism), and boundary conditions/nonlocal structure cannot be treated as optional add‑ons. Methodologically, the synthesis emphasizes **deterministic, schema‑driven research pipelines** (CLI‑operable, reproducible) that standardize acquisition, analysis, visualization, and narrative generation so competing claims can be compared on equal footing. The key actionable insight is that treating RG/coarse‑graining as the operational axis turns high‑level emergence narratives into concrete, auditable workflows—while the main gap is translating these convergent conceptual bridges into **sharply discriminating empirical or consistency tests** that rule out whole classes of models rather than refining interpretations.\n\n---\n\n## INTEGRATED CORE FRAMEWORK: COARSE-GRAINING, ENTANGLEMENT, AND EMERGENCE\n\n## Integrated Core Framework: Coarse-Graining, Entanglement, and Emergence\n\nA unifying scaffold across contemporary quantum-gravity research (roughly 2015–2025, with especially explicit framing in 2020–2021 cross-program editorials) is the idea that **renormalization-group (RG) reasoning and coarse-graining provide the general “integration mechanism”** linking microscopic candidates for spacetime to emergent semiclassical geometry and, ultimately, phenomenology. In this report, *integration* is used in a technical sense: the controlled elimination or reparameterization of degrees of freedom so that large-scale observables become insensitive to microscopic details except through a small set of effective couplings or collective variables. This motif appears across otherwise disparate programs because quantum gravity confronts the same structural problem everywhere: we possess candidate micro-descriptions (continuum fields, discrete complexes, combinatorial quantum many-body data), yet the target regime is a smooth, approximately local, diffeomorphism-invariant spacetime with familiar effective field theory behavior. The RG supplies a language for this translation—**flows in “theory space,” fixed points, universality classes, and phase structure**—and coarse-graining supplies the operational tools (blocking, refinement/coarsening maps, tensor-network contractions, functional RG equations) for implementing it.\n\nWithin this common frame, different approaches instantiate coarse-graining in distinct but conceptually homologous ways. In **asymptotic safety**, the integration mechanism is most explicit: the **functional renormalization group (FRG)** tracks scale dependence of an effective action, seeking an interacting **UV fixed point** (often associated with the Reuter fixed point) and a **finite set of UV-relevant directions** that underwrite predictivity. Here the continuum is assumed from the start, and “emergence” is captured by RG trajectories that run from a nontrivial ultraviolet regime to an infrared domain approximating general relativity plus matter. In **spin-foam and loop-quantum-gravity-adjacent** lines, coarse-graining is realized as **refinement/coarsening relations between complexes** and as RG flows defined through boundary data; a key emphasis (2018–2025) is diagnosing continuum recovery and the (re)emergence of effective diffeomorphism symmetry via background-independent renormalization, including numerics and **tensor-network-inspired** renormalization schemes for spin nets/foams. In **group field theory (GFT) and tensorial GFT**, the same integration motif is expressed in QFT language: one builds a theory space of combinatorially nonlocal interactions and applies **power counting, beta functions, and FRG flows** to chart phase structure, with particular attention to **condensation/collective phases** that can support emergent continuum geometry. Across these examples, the shared assumption is not that one microscopic model is already correct, but that *whatever the correct microstructure is, it must admit an RG description whose long-distance universality reproduces semiclassical spacetime*.\n\nA second consolidation thread—often developed most sharply in string-inspired settings but increasingly treated as a general lesson—is that **entanglement can function as a generative principle for geometry**, providing a complementary notion of integration. In holographic contexts, the emergence of bulk geometry is constrained (and in certain regimes effectively reconstructed) by boundary quantum-information data: coarse-graining the boundary theory corresponds to moving along an emergent radial direction, and entanglement measures organize which geometric features are robust under that coarse-graining. The conceptual payoff for the present framework is that RG is not merely a bookkeeping device for couplings; it is also a **structured loss of information** in which entanglement determines what remains “geometric” after integrating out microscopic detail. Even where strict holographic duality is absent, the same guiding idea persists: *geometry is the stable, compressible summary of quantum correlations at large scales*. This positions entanglement as the bridge between “microstate complexity” and “macrostate simplicity,” aligning naturally with Wilsonian universality.\n\nThe meta-insight that motivates this section—and that the rest of the report builds on—is that many program-specific developments become legible as variations on a single integration story: **(i) define microscopic degrees of freedom; (ii) specify a coarse-graining/RG map that relates descriptions across scales; (iii) identify fixed points, phases, and effective symmetries; (iv) extract emergent semiclassical observables**. Key terms are therefore used in a deliberately cross-cutting way: *coarse-graining* is any principled map from fine to effective descriptions; *RG flow* is the induced trajectory in a space of theories or amplitudes; *fixed point* denotes scale-invariant structure organizing universality; *phase structure* encodes qualitatively distinct macroscopic regimes; and *emergence* denotes the appearance of approximate locality, continuum geometry, and diffeomorphism-invariant dynamics as collective behavior. On this view, the field’s recent progress is not only in improving individual models, but also in clarifying the shared conceptual architecture that allows disparate ideas—continuum FRG fixed points, discrete tensor-network renormalization, and entanglement-based geometric reconstruction—to be consolidated into a coherent, testable framework.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS: NONLOCALITY, BOUNDARY CONDITIONS, AND WHAT MUST BE TRUE\n\nBell’s theorem and decades of increasingly loophole-closed experiments force any “deeper-than-quantum” model into a narrow corner: if it reproduces observed entanglement correlations, it must abandon at least one of the classical intuitions of local realism, measurement independence (“free choice”), or straightforward single-outcome dynamics without additional structure. In practice, the cleanest reading is that nature exhibits nonlocal correlations that cannot be explained by local hidden variables, even though they do not enable controllable faster-than-light signaling (the no-signaling constraint remains intact). This creates an immediate tension for deterministic hidden-variable approaches: determinism can be retained, but only by introducing nonlocal beables and typically some extra relativistic “scaffolding” (often a preferred foliation or equivalent rule for synchronizing updates) to keep the theory well-defined. By contrast, emergence narratives that place entanglement at the foundation (rather than treating it as a puzzling add-on) take the Bell facts as a positive clue: nonlocal correlation structure is not a bug to be hidden but a primitive resource from which effective locality and classical spacetime behavior must be derived.\n\nBoundary conditions become the next major constraint because they are where one specifies what counts as an admissible history/model and what data are held fixed. In gravitational and quantum-gravitational settings, boundary data are not merely bookkeeping; they can encode the degrees of freedom that “anchor” the bulk description (as in holographic intuitions) and determine whether an effective semiclassical regime is even well-posed. This elevates the importance of carefully formulating boundaries—spatial, null, asymptotic, or relational—and of testing whether continuum behavior is robust under changes of regulator and coarse-graining (a controlled “continuum-extrapolation” demand). In discrete or nonlocal approaches—e.g., causal-set–inspired nonlocal d’Alembertians or spin-foam/LQG coarse-graining programs—boundary prescriptions also control which nonlocalities are physical versus gauge/artifact, and whether effective diffeomorphism/Lorentz symmetry is recovered in the infrared. Put bluntly: it is not enough to posit discreteness or nonlocal microdynamics; one must show that with sensible boundary conditions the theory flows (via renormalization/coarse-graining) toward the observed low-energy symmetries and correlation functions.\n\nSelf-referential or “introspective” boundary formulations sharpen these issues by allowing the boundary to depend on properties of the state/dynamics it helps define (e.g., feedback where a vacuum functional encodes effective couplings, or boundary terms selected by consistency/stability conditions). Such constructions are attractive because they offer a mechanism-like alternative to arbitrary external choice—boundary data could be constrained by fixed-point/self-consistency requirements rather than stipulated by hand. But they also raise hard constraints: self-reference must not reintroduce hidden signaling channels, must preserve unitarity (or else specify precisely where/how it fails), and must remain stable under perturbations and RG flow rather than producing fine-tuned or inconsistent solutions. In the same spirit, “emergent geometry from entanglement” programs must demonstrate that geometric observables are insensitive to microscopic gauge choices and boundary parametrizations, and that bulk-like behavior disappears or changes predictably when entanglement/connectivity patterns are modified—otherwise the boundary-to-bulk narrative risks being interpretive gloss rather than a falsifiable mechanism.\n\nAcross these themes, the compatibility/tension structure is comparatively crisp. Local hidden-variable intuitions are directly incompatible with the Bell-certified structure of correlations unless one pays a price (preferred frames/foliations, explicit nonlocal update rules, or relaxed measurement independence), and each price comes with identifiable phenomenological and conceptual liabilities—especially regarding relativistic symmetry. Emergence narratives that treat locality, Lorentz invariance, and smooth manifolds as effective descriptions are more naturally aligned with the empirical nonlocality: the task becomes explaining why effective locality and no-signaling arise, not insisting on them microscopically. However, emergence does not grant a free pass: boundary conditions, coarse-graining, and universality must be demonstrated, not assumed. The resulting “what must be true” constraint can be stated operationally: any viable model must (i) reproduce Bell-type nonlocal correlations while enforcing no-signaling, (ii) specify boundary conditions that make the dynamics well-posed and regulator-robust, and (iii) recover the observed low-energy symmetry structure (approximately Lorentz/diffeomorphism invariance and effective locality) as a stable emergent regime—otherwise it remains either empirically wrong or mathematically underdetermined.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## METHODOLOGY & TOOLING: DETERMINISTIC, SCHEMA-DRIVEN RESEARCH PIPELINES FOR SYNTHESIS\n\n### Methodology & Tooling: Deterministic, Schema-Driven Research Pipelines for Synthesis\n\nOperationally, the synthesis program is implemented as a **schema-driven, CLI-accessible research pipeline** in which every stage—from data acquisition through analysis, visualization, and written synthesis—produces **deterministic, reproducible artifacts**. “Schema-driven” means that each intermediate product (e.g., parsed bibliographic records, extracted claims, model fits, coarse-graining outputs, diagnostic plots, synthesized notes) is emitted as a versioned object conforming to an explicit machine-checkable schema (e.g., JSON Schema / Pydantic models). This turns research outputs into stable “APIs” between stages: downstream steps can rely on well-defined fields, units, provenance, and invariants, and upstream changes become detectable rather than silently breaking later synthesis. “CLI-accessible” means each pipeline step is runnable with pinned inputs/configs and produces a documented output directory layout, so the full workflow can be executed identically by others (or in CI) without interactive notebooks or implicit state.\n\nDeterminism is enforced end-to-end with **fixed seeds, stable serialization, and tolerance-aware numeric comparisons**. In practice this requires choosing canonical serialization (sorted keys, fixed float formatting, stable timestamps handled as metadata rather than content), hashing inputs/outputs to create content-addressed identifiers, and establishing project-wide numeric diff rules (absolute/relative tolerances, deterministic reductions, and explicit handling for stochastic components). The pipeline is hardened by first eliminating execution blockers (syntax/import failures, non-hermetic dependencies), then adding **lightweight regression tests** that verify each step’s outputs against “golden” reference artifacts under CI. These golden tests are more than unit tests: they validate that the pipeline still produces the same schema-valid outputs (or changes only in reviewed, intentional ways), which is essential when research evolves rapidly. Where exact bitwise equality is unrealistic (e.g., floating-point drift across BLAS versions), the pipeline uses structured comparison (field-by-field diffs plus tolerance-aware numeric checks) so reproducibility remains enforceable rather than aspirational.\n\nCrucially, the tooling treats each study/benchmark as an **exportable, reconstructable bundle**: code, configs, raw inputs (or acquisition manifests), pinned environments, intermediate artifacts, diagnostics, and expected outputs are packaged so results can be reproduced outside the original workstation and months later. This is what makes multi-source synthesis scalable without duplication: instead of repeatedly re-reading or re-running ad hoc analyses, the report-building layer consumes validated artifacts with clear provenance and versioning. For example, a literature ingestion stage can normalize citations and claims into a unified schema; a conceptual mapping stage can attach tags such as “spacetime emergence,” “entanglement/geometry duality,” or “continuum recovery,” and a synthesis stage can merge these objects while preserving traceability to source passages and analysis parameters. The same discipline applies to computational research threads: pipeline stages can separately capture simulation parameters, coarse-graining operators, and measured observables, allowing later synthesis to compare like-with-like across runs and methods rather than across narratives.\n\nThis infrastructure also supports integrating heterogeneous insights—from foundational questions (e.g., whether spacetime is emergent from entanglement structure) to technical developments (e.g., spin-foam LQG’s shift toward coarse-graining and renormalization diagnostics) to exploratory computational proposals (e.g., coarse-graining deterministic chaotic lattices to test for scale-dependent effective “ℏ”). The key is that each thread yields **standardized, schema-validated outputs**: e.g., renormalization/coarse-graining results exported as scale-indexed flow objects with symmetry diagnostics; chaotic-field experiments exported as time/scale-indexed correlators, response functions, Lyapunov estimates, and fitted scaling laws (including uncertainty metadata). Once expressed in comparable, versioned structures, synthesis becomes a deterministic join over artifacts rather than a manual reconciliation of incompatible formats. In turn, CI-backed reproducibility guarantees that when the conceptual program is updated—new papers added, models refined, or pipelines extended—the report’s claims remain auditable: every statement can be traced to a stable artifact produced by a pipeline that anyone can rerun and verify.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CROSS-CUTTING INSIGHTS, GAPS, AND NEXT STEPS\n\nAcross the conceptual framework, physics constraints, and tooling approach, a single through-line has become operationally decisive: **RG/coarse-graining is the shared “translation axis” that turns emergence narratives into comparable pipelines**. In holography and tensor-network models, “geometry from entanglement” is most precise where the entanglement dictionary is controlled (e.g., RT/QES surfaces, wedge reconstruction, code-like redundancy), while in spin foams/LQG and related discrete approaches the most concrete progress is increasingly framed as **background-independent renormalization and continuum recovery**, including criteria for approximate diffeomorphism symmetry restoration under refinement. These are not competing stories so much as different instantiations of the same workflow: specify microscopic degrees of freedom, define a coarse-graining map, identify preserved constraints/observables, and diagnose phases/fixed points that correspond to semiclassical spacetime. The resource-theoretic reframing of entanglement and decoherence closes this loop by supplying the “engineering semantics”: entanglement is the structured resource whose redistribution under coarse-graining is hypothesized to yield geometry, while decoherence is the dominant loss channel that can mimic or erase geometric signatures unless explicitly modeled.\n\nThat alignment also clarifies the **physics constraints that any cross-program claim must survive**. Many entanglement→geometry correspondences are sharpest in idealized limits (large‑N, pure states, static settings), whereas both laboratory testbeds (qubits/atoms) and many non-holographic quantum-gravity programs live in regimes that are finite, noisy, mixed, and time-dependent. This creates a recurring identifiability problem: multiple reconstruction targets—mutual-information graphs (connectivity), correlator-decay distances, entropy-scaling curvature proxies, and stricter RT/QECC-consistent “metric” data—can agree in special cases but diverge under finite-size effects, open-system dynamics, or measurement back-action. In parallel, background independence and the meaning of “scale” remain nontrivial in discrete gravity: coarse-graining must be defined without presupposing a metric, and continuum recovery must be diagnosed via symmetry restoration and universality rather than by importing lattice-QFT intuitions unmodified. The synthesis therefore points to a shared bottleneck across communities: **without explicit nuisance/noise models and stability bounds, reconstructed “geometry changes” risk being re-descriptions of correlation reshaping** (dephasing, loss, heating, imperfect control) rather than evidence for a gravitational or holography-like dictionary.\n\nThe resulting gaps are best grouped as (i) **conceptual**: missing formal, operational mappings between coarse-graining (RG flows, universality, fixed points) and entanglement geometry (RT/QES, wedge reconstruction, code properties), especially for mixed states, finite‑N, and dynamical settings; and persistent ambiguity in what “geometry” denotes operationally across pipelines (graph vs distance vs curvature vs metric consistency). (ii) **empirical**: insufficient end-to-end benchmarks that can be run both in controlled numerics (toy holographic models, tensor networks, DMRG) and in devices (cold atoms, superconducting qubits, analogue horizons), including null tests that quantify how often “geometric” signatures are reproduced by calibrated noise reshaping alone. (iii) **methodological/tooling**: the translation layer is intentionally minimal today, but it lacks automated enforcement of regime assumptions, required metadata (pure/mixed, temperature, noise spectrum, finite-size scaling), and cross-source consistency checks; more broadly, we still lack standardized schemas for reporting coarse-graining maps, preserved constraints, and uncertainty propagation so that results are comparable rather than rhetorically adjacent.\n\nPrioritized next steps therefore focus on tightening the **formal correspondences, testable predictions, and reproducible pipelines**. First, pursue **explicit “commuting diagram” constructions** that relate entanglement-to-geometry maps to coarse-graining flows: define a coarse-graining step on states/channels (e.g., tensor-network blocking, spin-foam refinement/decimation, learned multiscale bases) and require that geometric observables reconstructed from entanglement be stable (or change predictably) under that step; this is the practical bridge between “geometry emerges from entanglement” and “continuum is a phase under RG.” Second, establish a **small benchmark suite with expected relationships and failure modes**: canonical toy states/circuits (MERA-like, random circuits, thermofield-double analogs), standardized outputs (mutual information profiles, Rényi proxies, entanglement spectrum features, reconstruction fidelity thresholds, OTOCs/scrambling), and noise-aware uncertainty accounting (filter-function/noise-spectroscopy layer) so that “geometry indicators” can be falsified under controlled perturbations. Third, extend the tooling into an integration and accountability loop: evolve `translation_layer_v0_1` into a living contract (required fields, allowed synonyms, regime tags, normalization disclaimers), wire it into CI-style checks, and expand package-level diagnostics (e.g., the emerging `sf_gft_diagnostics` API) so every new claim/node is automatically (a) mapped to anchors, (b) checked for missing assumptions/metadata, and (c) tracked as a testable hypothesis with linked benchmarks and provenance. This pipeline extension—automated gap detection plus hypothesis tracking—directly targets the synthesis’s core objective: replacing persuasive emergence narratives with operational, cross-framework correspondences that remain robust under finite resources, noise, and genuinely background-independent notions of scale.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Formal theoretical connection between coarse-graining procedures, entanglement measures, and emergence.

In this view, **entanglement functions as the organizing resource** and, under systematic coarse‑graining (RG flow, tensor networks, holography), **effective geometry and spacetime dynamics emerge** as macroscopic descriptions of underlying quantum information structure. This framing helps align programs that otherwise look incompatible—e.g., holographic duality, tensor‑network constructions, and other emergent‑gravity approaches—by focusing on what is preserved or discarded under scale transformations and how entanglement patterns constrain allowable effective laws.\n\nOn the constraints side, **Bell‑type results and loophole‑closed experiments sharply narrow viable “deeper than quantum” models**: any theory matching observed correlations must relinquish at least one classical assumption (strict locality, measurement independence/free choice, or simple realism), and boundary conditions/nonlocal structure cannot be treated as optional add‑ons. Methodologically, the synthesis emphasizes **deterministic, schema‑driven research pipelines** (CLI‑operable, reproducible) that standardize acquisition, analysis, visualization, and narrative generation so competing claims can be compared on equal footing. The key actionable insight is that treating RG/coarse‑graining as the operational axis turns high‑level emergence narratives into concrete, auditable workflows—while the main gap is translating these convergent conceptual bridges into **sharply discriminating empirical or consistency tests** that rule out whole classes of models rather than refining interpretations.\n\n---\n\n## INTEGRATED CORE FRAMEWORK: COARSE-GRAINING, ENTANGLEMENT, AND EMERGENCE\n\n## Integrated Core Framework: Coarse-Graining, Entanglement, and Emergence\n\nA unifying scaffold across contemporary quantum-gravity research (roughly 2015–2025, with especially explicit framing in 2020–2021 cross-program editorials) is the idea that **renormalization-group (RG) reasoning and coarse-graining provide the general “integration mechanism”** linking microscopic candidates for spacetime to emergent semiclassical geometry and, ultimately, phenomenology. In this report, *integration* is used in a technical sense: the controlled elimination or reparameterization of degrees of freedom so that large-scale observables become insensitive to microscopic details except through a small set of effective couplings or collective variables. This motif appears across otherwise disparate programs because quantum gravity confronts the same structural problem everywhere: we possess candidate micro-descriptions (continuum fields, discrete complexes, combinatorial quantum many-body data), yet the target regime is a smooth, approximately local, diffeomorphism-invariant spacetime with familiar effective field theory behavior. The RG supplies a language for this translation—**flows in “theory space,” fixed points, universality classes, and phase structure**—and coarse-graining supplies the operational tools (blocking, refinement/coarsening maps, tensor-network contractions, functional RG equations) for implementing it.\n\nWithin this common frame, different approaches instantiate coarse-graining in distinct but conceptually homologous ways. In **asymptotic safety**, the integration mechanism is most explicit: the **functional renormalization group (FRG)** tracks scale dependence of an effective action, seeking an interacting **UV fixed point** (often associated with the Reuter fixed point) and a **finite set of UV-relevant directions** that underwrite predictivity. Here the continuum is assumed from the start, and “emergence” is captured by RG trajectories that run from a nontrivial ultraviolet regime to an infrared domain approximating general relativity plus matter. In **spin-foam and loop-quantum-gravity-adjacent** lines, coarse-graining is realized as **refinement/coarsening relations between complexes** and as RG flows defined through boundary data; a key emphasis (2018–2025) is diagnosing continuum recovery and the (re)emergence of effective diffeomorphism symmetry via background-independent renormalization, including numerics and **tensor-network-inspired** renormalization schemes for spin nets/foams. In **group field theory (GFT) and tensorial GFT**, the same integration motif is expressed in QFT language: one builds a theory space of combinatorially nonlocal interactions and applies **power counting, beta functions, and FRG flows** to chart phase structure, with particular attention to **condensation/collective phases** that can support emergent continuum geometry. Across these examples, the shared assumption is not that one microscopic model is already correct, but that *whatever the correct microstructure is, it must admit an RG description whose long-distance universality reproduces semiclassical spacetime*.\n\nA second consolidation thread—often developed most sharply in string-inspired settings but increasingly treated as a general lesson—is that **entanglement can function as a generative principle for geometry**, providing a complementary notion of integration. In holographic contexts, the emergence of bulk geometry is constrained (and in certain regimes effectively reconstructed) by boundary quantum-information data: coarse-graining the boundary theory corresponds to moving along an emergent radial direction, and entanglement measures organize which geometric features are robust under that coarse-graining. The conceptual payoff for the present framework is that RG is not merely a bookkeeping device for couplings; it is also a **structured loss of information** in which entanglement determines what remains “geometric” after integrating out microscopic detail. Even where strict holographic duality is absent, the same guiding idea persists: *geometry is the stable, compressible summary of quantum correlations at large scales*. This positions entanglement as the bridge between “microstate complexity” and “macrostate simplicity,” aligning naturally with Wilsonian universality.\n\nThe meta-insight that motivates this section—and that the rest of the report builds on—is that many program-specific developments become legible as variations on a single integration story: **(i) define microscopic degrees of freedom; (ii) specify a coarse-graining/RG map that relates descriptions across scales; (iii) identify fixed points, phases, and effective symmetries; (iv) extract emergent semiclassical observables**. Key terms are therefore used in a deliberately cross-cutting way: *coarse-graining* is any principled map from fine to effective descriptions; *RG flow* is the induced trajectory in a space of theories or amplitudes; *fixed point* denotes scale-invariant structure organizing universality; *phase structure* encodes qualitatively distinct macroscopic regimes; and *emergence* denotes the appearance of approximate locality, continuum geometry, and diffeomorphism-invariant dynamics as collective behavior. On this view, the field’s recent progress is not only in improving individual models, but also in clarifying the shared conceptual architecture that allows disparate ideas—continuum FRG fixed points, discrete tensor-network renormalization, and entanglement-based geometric reconstruction—to be consolidated into a coherent, testable framework.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS: NONLOCALITY, BOUNDARY CONDITIONS, AND WHAT MUST BE TRUE\n\nBell’s theorem and decades of increasingly loophole-closed experiments force any “deeper-than-quantum” model into a narrow corner: if it reproduces observed entanglement correlations, it must abandon at least one of the classical intuitions of local realism, measurement independence (“free choice”), or straightforward single-outcome dynamics without additional structure. In practice, the cleanest reading is that nature exhibits nonlocal correlations that cannot be explained by local hidden variables, even though they do not enable controllable faster-than-light signaling (the no-signaling constraint remains intact). This creates an immediate tension for deterministic hidden-variable approaches: determinism can be retained, but only by introducing nonlocal beables and typically some extra relativistic “scaffolding” (often a preferred foliation or equivalent rule for synchronizing updates) to keep the theory well-defined. By contrast, emergence narratives that place entanglement at the foundation (rather than treating it as a puzzling add-on) take the Bell facts as a positive clue: nonlocal correlation structure is not a bug to be hidden but a primitive resource from which effective locality and classical spacetime behavior must be derived.\n\nBoundary conditions become the next major constraint because they are where one specifies what counts as an admissible history/model and what data are held fixed. In gravitational and quantum-gravitational settings, boundary data are not merely bookkeeping; they can encode the degrees of freedom that “anchor” the bulk description (as in holographic intuitions) and determine whether an effective semiclassical regime is even well-posed. This elevates the importance of carefully formulating boundaries—spatial, null, asymptotic, or relational—and of testing whether continuum behavior is robust under changes of regulator and coarse-graining (a controlled “continuum-extrapolation” demand). In discrete or nonlocal approaches—e.g., causal-set–inspired nonlocal d’Alembertians or spin-foam/LQG coarse-graining programs—boundary prescriptions also control which nonlocalities are physical versus gauge/artifact, and whether effective diffeomorphism/Lorentz symmetry is recovered in the infrared. Put bluntly: it is not enough to posit discreteness or nonlocal microdynamics; one must show that with sensible boundary conditions the theory flows (via renormalization/coarse-graining) toward the observed low-energy symmetries and correlation functions.\n\nSelf-referential or “introspective” boundary formulations sharpen these issues by allowing the boundary to depend on properties of the state/dynamics it helps define (e.g., feedback where a vacuum functional encodes effective couplings, or boundary terms selected by consistency/stability conditions). Such constructions are attractive because they offer a mechanism-like alternative to arbitrary external choice—boundary data could be constrained by fixed-point/self-consistency requirements rather than stipulated by hand. But they also raise hard constraints: self-reference must not reintroduce hidden signaling channels, must preserve unitarity (or else specify precisely where/how it fails), and must remain stable under perturbations and RG flow rather than producing fine-tuned or inconsistent solutions. In the same spirit, “emergent geometry from entanglement” programs must demonstrate that geometric observables are insensitive to microscopic gauge choices and boundary parametrizations, and that bulk-like behavior disappears or changes predictably when entanglement/connectivity patterns are modified—otherwise the boundary-to-bulk narrative risks being interpretive gloss rather than a falsifiable mechanism.\n\nAcross these themes, the compatibility/tension structure is comparatively crisp. Local hidden-variable intuitions are directly incompatible with the Bell-certified structure of correlations unless one pays a price (preferred frames/foliations, explicit nonlocal update rules, or relaxed measurement independence), and each price comes with identifiable phenomenological and conceptual liabilities—especially regarding relativistic symmetry. Emergence narratives that treat locality, Lorentz invariance, and smooth manifolds as effective descriptions are more naturally aligned with the empirical nonlocality: the task becomes explaining why effective locality and no-signaling arise, not insisting on them microscopically. However, emergence does not grant a free pass: boundary conditions, coarse-graining, and universality must be demonstrated, not assumed. The resulting “what must be true” constraint can be stated operationally: any viable model must (i) reproduce Bell-type nonlocal correlations while enforcing no-signaling, (ii) specify boundary conditions that make the dynamics well-posed and regulator-robust, and (iii) recover the observed low-energy symmetry structure (approximately Lorentz/diffeomorphism invariance and effective locality) as a stable emergent regime—otherwise it remains either empirically wrong or mathematically underdetermined.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## METHODOLOGY & TOOLING: DETERMINISTIC, SCHEMA-DRIVEN RESEARCH PIPELINES FOR SYNTHESIS\n\n### Methodology & Tooling: Deterministic, Schema-Driven Research Pipelines for Synthesis\n\nOperationally, the synthesis program is implemented as a **schema-driven, CLI-accessible research pipeline** in which every stage—from data acquisition through analysis, visualization, and written synthesis—produces **deterministic, reproducible artifacts**. “Schema-driven” means that each intermediate product (e.g., parsed bibliographic records, extracted claims, model fits, coarse-graining outputs, diagnostic plots, synthesized notes) is emitted as a versioned object conforming to an explicit machine-checkable schema (e.g., JSON Schema / Pydantic models). This turns research outputs into stable “APIs” between stages: downstream steps can rely on well-defined fields, units, provenance, and invariants, and upstream changes become detectable rather than silently breaking later synthesis. “CLI-accessible” means each pipeline step is runnable with pinned inputs/configs and produces a documented output directory layout, so the full workflow can be executed identically by others (or in CI) without interactive notebooks or implicit state.\n\nDeterminism is enforced end-to-end with **fixed seeds, stable serialization, and tolerance-aware numeric comparisons**. In practice this requires choosing canonical serialization (sorted keys, fixed float formatting, stable timestamps handled as metadata rather than content), hashing inputs/outputs to create content-addressed identifiers, and establishing project-wide numeric diff rules (absolute/relative tolerances, deterministic reductions, and explicit handling for stochastic components). The pipeline is hardened by first eliminating execution blockers (syntax/import failures, non-hermetic dependencies), then adding **lightweight regression tests** that verify each step’s outputs against “golden” reference artifacts under CI. These golden tests are more than unit tests: they validate that the pipeline still produces the same schema-valid outputs (or changes only in reviewed, intentional ways), which is essential when research evolves rapidly. Where exact bitwise equality is unrealistic (e.g., floating-point drift across BLAS versions), the pipeline uses structured comparison (field-by-field diffs plus tolerance-aware numeric checks) so reproducibility remains enforceable rather than aspirational.\n\nCrucially, the tooling treats each study/benchmark as an **exportable, reconstructable bundle**: code, configs, raw inputs (or acquisition manifests), pinned environments, intermediate artifacts, diagnostics, and expected outputs are packaged so results can be reproduced outside the original workstation and months later. This is what makes multi-source synthesis scalable without duplication: instead of repeatedly re-reading or re-running ad hoc analyses, the report-building layer consumes validated artifacts with clear provenance and versioning. For example, a literature ingestion stage can normalize citations and claims into a unified schema; a conceptual mapping stage can attach tags such as “spacetime emergence,” “entanglement/geometry duality,” or “continuum recovery,” and a synthesis stage can merge these objects while preserving traceability to source passages and analysis parameters. The same discipline applies to computational research threads: pipeline stages can separately capture simulation parameters, coarse-graining operators, and measured observables, allowing later synthesis to compare like-with-like across runs and methods rather than across narratives.\n\nThis infrastructure also supports integrating heterogeneous insights—from foundational questions (e.g., whether spacetime is emergent from entanglement structure) to technical developments (e.g., spin-foam LQG’s shift toward coarse-graining and renormalization diagnostics) to exploratory computational proposals (e.g., coarse-graining deterministic chaotic lattices to test for scale-dependent effective “ℏ”). The key is that each thread yields **standardized, schema-validated outputs**: e.g., renormalization/coarse-graining results exported as scale-indexed flow objects with symmetry diagnostics; chaotic-field experiments exported as time/scale-indexed correlators, response functions, Lyapunov estimates, and fitted scaling laws (including uncertainty metadata). Once expressed in comparable, versioned structures, synthesis becomes a deterministic join over artifacts rather than a manual reconciliation of incompatible formats. In turn, CI-backed reproducibility guarantees that when the conceptual program is updated—new papers added, models refined, or pipelines extended—the report’s claims remain auditable: every statement can be traced to a stable artifact produced by a pipeline that anyone can rerun and verify.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## CROSS-CUTTING INSIGHTS, GAPS, AND NEXT STEPS\n\nAcross the conceptual framework, physics constraints, and tooling approach, a single through-line has become operationally decisive: **RG/coarse-graining is the shared “translation axis” that turns emergence narratives into comparable pipelines**. In holography and tensor-network models, “geometry from entanglement” is most precise where the entanglement dictionary is controlled (e.g., RT/QES surfaces, wedge reconstruction, code-like redundancy), while in spin foams/LQG and related discrete approaches the most concrete progress is increasingly framed as **background-independent renormalization and continuum recovery**, including criteria for approximate diffeomorphism symmetry restoration under refinement. These are not competing stories so much as different instantiations of the same workflow: specify microscopic degrees of freedom, define a coarse-graining map, identify preserved constraints/observables, and diagnose phases/fixed points that correspond to semiclassical spacetime. The resource-theoretic reframing of entanglement and decoherence closes this loop by supplying the “engineering semantics”: entanglement is the structured resource whose redistribution under coarse-graining is hypothesized to yield geometry, while decoherence is the dominant loss channel that can mimic or erase geometric signatures unless explicitly modeled.\n\nThat alignment also clarifies the **physics constraints that any cross-program claim must survive**.

The central finding is that the field has matured program‑internally (with strong, approach‑specific toolchains), but remains bottlenecked at the synthesis level by incompatible notions of “scale,” “observable,” and “continuum limit.” Where cross‑program alignment is strongest, it is driven by **operationally defined observables** (e.g., entanglement and relative entropy, spectral/diffusion dimension, coarse‑grained geometry correlators, S‑matrix/EFT data), and by shared RG language (universality classes, fixed points, and effective descriptions). The report’s key value is an actionable map of *translation conventions*—how to compare calculations that do not share variables, kinematics, or even background structures—so that claims of “emergence of geometry,” “unitarity,” or “UV completion” become testable and mutually interpretable rather than program‑relative.\n\nThe roadmap identifies a small set of cross‑cutting blockers and corresponding high‑leverage research priorities. Technically, the main obstacles are (1) **universality and controlled continuum limits** for discrete/algebraic approaches; (2) **gauge‑invariant coarse‑graining** and the construction of comparable, renormalized observables; (3) **dynamics of entanglement and modular flow** as a shared substrate for emergent spacetime claims (especially in holography and tensor‑network/QI approaches) and their connection to semiclassical gravity; and (4) **precision matching to EFT and phenomenology**, including robustness to field redefinitions and scheme dependence. The execution plan emphasizes establishing benchmark problems (e.g., black‑hole information diagnostics, cosmological perturbations from candidate microdynamics, RG flows reproducing semiclassical GR, and consistency conditions from causality/positivity), building shared data and code standards for coarse‑graining pipelines, and prioritizing “bridge results” that simultaneously constrain multiple approaches. The outcome is a practical, comparative research agenda aimed at converting qualitative emergence narratives into **controlled, reproducible pipelines** with clear interfaces to observation and to one another.\n\n---\n\n## I. FRAMING THE CROSS-APPROACH QUANTUM-GRAVITY ROADMAP\n\n## I. Framing the Cross-Approach Quantum-Gravity Roadmap\n\nA persistent feature of the 2020–2025 quantum-gravity literature is that, despite many excellent program-specific reviews, it remains difficult to identify a *single* synthesis that spans the full landscape—string theory and holography, loop quantum gravity (LQG) and spin foams, causal dynamical triangulations (CDT), causal sets, group field theory (GFT), and asymptotic safety—in a way that is simultaneously technically meaningful and operationally comparative. What *has* emerged instead are cross-cutting “mapping” contributions and special-issue framings that treat multiple approaches through shared themes, with **renormalization and coarse graining** repeatedly singled out as the most productive unifying thread. This roadmap adopts that premise explicitly: rather than attempting an encyclopedic survey of each program, it asks how each one implements a common agenda—**connecting microscopic degrees of freedom to an emergent semiclassical spacetime and, ultimately, to empirical contact**—and it uses renormalization-group (RG) ideas, continuum limits, and phase structure as the main comparative language.\n\nThe scope is therefore defined around a small number of *success criteria* that are meaningful across otherwise incommensurate frameworks. (1) **A well-posed notion of scale and flow:** a Wilsonian RG map, functional RG (FRG) equation, refinement/coarsening scheme, or an equivalent mechanism that relates descriptions at different resolutions. (2) **A controlled continuum/semi-classical regime:** either an interacting UV fixed point with a finite number of relevant directions (as targeted in asymptotic safety via FRG flows, often discussed in terms of a Reuter-type fixed point and predictivity from few UV-relevant couplings), or a critical point/second-order transition in a discrete model that supports a continuum limit (as pursued in CDT and increasingly in spin-foam/GFT coarse-graining programs). (3) **Symmetries and constraints at large scales:** in particular, the recovery (or effective realization) of diffeomorphism invariance or its discrete/dual counterpart, which has become a focal diagnostic in background-independent coarse graining—e.g., the recent spin-foam shift from largely kinematical achievements toward continuum recovery via explicit renormalization and attempts to restore effective diffeomorphism symmetry. (4) **A route to observables and phenomenology:** whether via boundary observables and amplitudes (spin foams), correlation functions and effective actions (FRG/asymptotic safety), large-scale geometric observables and scaling dimensions (CDT), or holographic observables where a dual quantum system defines the theory nonperturbatively (string-based/holographic settings).\n\nWithin this framing, the roadmap organizes the field into two renormalization “families” that have consolidated over the past decade while remaining conceptually aligned. On the **continuum side**, asymptotic safety operationalizes RG with FRG flows for an effective average action, searching for UV fixed points and charting trajectories into infrared semiclassical regimes, increasingly including **gravity–matter systems** and richer truncations. On the **discrete/coarse-graining side**, spin foams, tensor-network-inspired spin-net/foam renormalization, GFT, and CDT build RG notions from **refinement and blocking transformations on discrete structures**, often diagnosing candidate continuum limits through **phase diagrams and critical behavior** (frequently numerically), using criticality as a proxy for divergent correlation lengths and emergent continuum physics. The key point is not to declare a winner but to make comparisons actionable: both families are best understood as different implementations of Wilsonian thinking under different constraints (background independence, discretization choices, availability of a dual description), and both increasingly use the same diagnostic vocabulary—flows, fixed points, universality classes, and emergent symmetries—to benchmark progress.\n\nTo support consistent cross-reading, the remainder of this report standardizes terminology and comparison dimensions used in each subsequent case study. We characterize each approach by (i) **degrees of freedom** (fields/metrics, connections and holonomies, simplicial geometries, causal order, group-valued data, boundary CFT operators), (ii) **dynamics** (path integrals and amplitudes, Hamiltonian/constraint implementations, FRG equations, transfer matrices, sum-over-histories rules), (iii) **symmetries/constraints** (diffeomorphisms and their discrete realizations, gauge constraints, locality/nonlocality), (iv) **observables** (correlators, boundary amplitudes, spectral/hausdorff dimensions, entanglement, S-matrix/bootstrapped data where available), (v) **continuum limit criteria** (UV fixed point vs. second-order transition/critical line, universality and scaling), (vi) **matter coupling** (minimal coupling, induced interactions, consistency constraints), and (vii) **empirical contact** (cosmology, black-hole physics, effective field theory matching, robustness under truncations/discretizations). An at-a-glance map at the end of this section links each program to later “testbeds” used throughout the roadmap—e.g., phase-structure studies (CDT and spin-foam/GFT), fixed-point and predictivity analyses (asymptotic safety), and symmetry-recovery diagnostics (background-independent coarse graining)—so that readers from different communities can locate where their familiar tools enter the shared renormalization-and-emergence narrative.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## II. APPROACH-SPECIFIC EXPOSITIONS THROUGH THE RENORMALIZATION/COARSE-GRAINING LENS\n\n## II. Approach-Specific Expositions Through the Renormalization/Coarse-Graining Lens\n\nAcross quantum-gravity programs, “renormalization/coarse graining” is less a single technique than a *translation layer* between microscopic degrees of freedom (discrete, algebraic, or field-theoretic) and emergent semiclassical spacetime. Two broad families of implementations dominate the 2015–2025 consolidation: **(i) continuum Wilsonian flows** (most explicitly in **Effective Field Theory (EFT)** and **Asymptotic Safety** via functional RG methods), and **(ii) discrete/background-independent coarse graining** (spin foams/spin nets, **Group Field Theory (GFT)/tensor models**, **Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)**, and, more conceptually, **causal sets**). In both families, *scale* is not merely a momentum cutoff: it may be a coarse-graining step on a complex, a representation label (spin), a tensor-network blocking depth, a diffusion time (spectral dimension), or a parameter controlling refinement. The unifying question is the same: **which RG trajectories and phases yield an extended, approximately diffeomorphism-invariant, semiclassical regime, and what observables certify that regime?** This lens also highlights a practical convergence: modern work increasingly relies on *phase diagrams, fixed points, and universality* as proxies for continuum limits—even when the microscopic formulation is not a standard local QFT.\n\n### Continuum EFT and Asymptotic Safety: RG flow as definition of “UV completion”\nIn **gravitational EFT**, one assumes that at scales well below a cutoff (often near the Planck scale), the dynamics is described by the Einstein–Hilbert term plus higher-curvature operators with coefficients organized by power counting. Here *scale* is the usual Wilsonian RG scale (momentum/energy), and coarse graining integrates out fluctuations above that scale. Renormalization is “successful” in the EFT sense: divergences are absorbed into higher-dimension operators, and the outputs are **controlled low-energy effective actions**, scattering amplitudes and **quantum corrections to classical potentials**, and curvature-expansion predictions with quantified truncation errors. EFT does not, by itself, specify a UV completion; it instead provides a systematic interface between any UV theory and infrared observables.\n\n**Asymptotic Safety** elevates the RG flow from an interface to a *nonperturbative definition* of the theory: one searches (typically with the **Functional Renormalization Group (FRG)**) for an **interacting UV fixed point** (often called the Reuter fixed point) with **a finite number of UV-relevant directions**, yielding predictivity. The fundamental variables in common truncations are the metric (or fields equivalent under reparameterizations), with couplings promoted to scale-dependent quantities; the key technical object is the effective average action \\(\\Gamma_k\\), interpolating between bare and full effective action as \\(k\\) is lowered. Renormalization status is comparatively mature: extensive evidence for nontrivial fixed points across truncations and in gravity–matter systems, plus a growing emphasis on **phase structure**, scheme dependence, and the mapping from RG trajectories to semiclassical regimes. Concrete outputs include scale-dependent Newton and cosmological couplings, higher-derivative operator flows, approximate **critical exponents** (UV-relevant directions), and candidate **effective actions** usable for cosmology and black-hole phenomenology—always with the caveat that robustness must be tested against truncation enlargement and field-parameterization choices.\n\n### Spin foams/LQG and background-independent coarse graining: refinement, cylindrical consistency, and restoration of symmetries\nIn **Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)** and **spin foams**, the microscopic degrees of freedom are combinatorial/algebraic: **holonomies and fluxes**, or equivalently **spin-network states** (graphs labeled by group representations and intertwiners), and spin-foam amplitudes defined on 2-complexes. “Scale” is not a background momentum; it is typically encoded via **graph/complex refinement**, representation labels (spins), or boundary data resolution. Coarse graining is therefore implemented as **maps between discretizations** (refinement/coarsening) designed to preserve physical predictions—an analogue of Wilsonian block-spinning, but in a background-independent setting.\n\nRenormalization in this sector has shifted (notably 2018–2025) from mainly kinematical achievements toward **continuum recovery**: defining RG flows on families of complexes, using **tensor-network renormalization (TNR)** and related numerical schemes for spin nets/foams, and diagnosing whether effective dynamics restores approximate **diffeomorphism symmetry** at large scales. Fixed points correspond to discretization-independent (“perfect”) amplitudes or topological phases; phase diagrams can reveal transitions between degenerate/branched-polymer–like behavior and extended geometric regimes. Concrete outputs are often *not* conventional correlation functions but include: effective boundary amplitudes, coarse-grained face/edge weights, emergent constraints, and spectral probes (e.g., scaling of geometric operators). The long-term target is a controlled continuum limit where semiclassical geometries dominate and gravitational propagators/low-energy effective actions can be extracted from the spin-foam path integral.\n\n### CDT, GFT/tensor models, string/AdS-CFT, causal sets, and emergent/information-theoretic approaches: phases, dual RGs, and entanglement as coarse graining\n**Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)** defines the gravitational path integral as a sum over **causal triangulations** with a preferred foliation structure (in standard implementations). Here “scale” is set by the triangulation lattice spacing and the number of simplices; coarse graining is pursued via **statistical-mechanical phase structure** and continuum extrapolations near critical surfaces. Renormalization is chiefly empirical/numerical: one maps a phase diagram (including extended “de Sitter–like” phases) and searches for second-order transitions that could support a continuum limit. Outputs include measured large-scale geometry (effective minisuperspace actions), **spectral dimension flow**, and scaling relations interpreted as effective continuum physics.\n\n**Group Field Theory (GFT)** and **tensor models** provide a QFT-like completion of spin-foam ideas: the fundamental variables are fields on group manifolds (GFT) or combinatorial tensors (tensor models), whose Feynman diagrams generate labeled complexes. Scale can be introduced via representation/momentum on the group, tensor sizes/ranks, or FRG cutoffs adapted to these nonlocal combinatorial interactions. Renormalization is explicit: power counting, beta functions, and **FRG flows** have been developed in a “theory space” of interactions, enabling the identification of fixed points and phases. A distinctive coarse-graining target is **condensation/collective phases** where many quanta of geometry yield emergent continuum spacetimes (e.g., cosmological effective dynamics from condensates). Outputs include beta functions, universality classes, effective (hydrodynamic) equations for condensate order parameters, and phase diagrams linking microscopic couplings to emergent dimensionality and geometry.\n\nIn **string theory**, coarse graining appears in multiple guises: worldsheet RG (as a consistency condition), spacetime EFT, and—most sharply—**holography (AdS/CFT)**, where the **radial direction** corresponds to an RG scale in the dual QFT. The “fundamental variables” depend on the formulation (strings/branes vs. boundary CFT operators), but the coarse-graining story is unusually concrete: boundary Wilsonian RG flows map to bulk radial evolution, and **entanglement measures** (e.g., entropy, modular Hamiltonians) become geometric via holographic relations. Renormalization status is nonperturbatively strongest where a dual CFT exists, while “fixed points” correspond to conformal theories and “flows” to domain-wall geometries. Outputs include boundary correlators at strong coupling, operator spectra, entanglement entropies, transport coefficients, and effective bulk actions (including higher-curvature corrections) inferred from CFT data.\n\n**Causal sets** posit that the fundamental structure is a locally finite **partial order** capturing causal relations, with scale related to *density* (discreteness scale) and to coarse-graining via random thinning or order-preserving maps. Renormalization is less standardized but naturally framed as defining effective dynamics under coarse-graining of the order. Outputs often emphasize kinematic and spectral diagnostics (dimension estimators, nonlocal d’Alembertian operators, causal-set Green functions) and phenomenological constraints, while the central open issue remains a robust continuum limit and a fully developed RG/fixed-point picture akin to other discrete approaches.\n\nFinally, **emergent-gravity/information-theoretic approaches** treat geometry as collective, with coarse graining often defined in terms of **entanglement structure**, quantum error correction, or complexity. Here “scale” may be an entanglement renormalization depth (tensor networks/MERA-like constructions) or an information-theoretic resolution parameter. Renormalization manifests as flow of effective descriptions under entanglement coarse graining; outputs are entanglement entropies, mutual informations, modular-flow data, and (in favorable cases) emergent effective gravitational equations or constraints consistent with semiclassical gravity. These approaches frequently interface with holography, where the RG/geometry dictionary is explicit and can serve as a benchmark for more speculative emergent scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized “Approach Cards” (for direct comparability)\n\n### 1) Gravitational EFT\n- **Core postulates:** GR is the leading term in a controlled low-energy expansion;

OPERATIONAL, EMPIRICAL, AND COMPARATIVE SYNTHESIS\n\n## III. Operational, Empirical, and Comparative Synthesis\n\nA cross-approach comparison program in quantum gravity (and gravity-adjacent approaches) becomes operational only once *observables* and *translation conventions* are made explicit. The most robust bridge identified across communities is **RG/coarse-graining as a shared “translation layer”** from microscopic kinematics (discrete, algebraic, or emergent degrees of freedom) to an effective semiclassical description. In this framing, the primary question is not “which fundamental variables are correct?”, but “what are the *universal* long-distance predictions after coarse-graining, and what minimal set of measurements (or proxies) can test them?” This motivates a compact menu of operational benchmarks that are comparatively portable: (i) **correlators** (in-in cosmological correlators, response functions, scattering/IR observables where applicable), (ii) **entanglement measures** (entropy/mutual information and their coarse-grained variants, in spirit aligned with entanglement-wedge/modular-flow thinking even when no AdS boundary exists), and (iii) **decoherence/noise spectra** in controlled quantum systems, analyzed via power spectral densities and filter-function methods so that theory inputs become *spectral scaling statements* rather than program-specific normalizations. Crucially, the synthesis also highlights a major limitation: many pipelines implicitly assume a smooth semiclassical limit “GR + small local corrections.” For discrete, background-independent, or intrinsically nonlocal approaches, the existence (and universality class) of such a limit is itself a hypothesis; without establishing it, mapping microscopic parameters to macroscopic observables can be ill-posed or non-unique.\n\nWithin this operational framing, several information-theoretic tools serve as comparators even when their native formulations differ. **Relational observables** (defined with respect to physical clocks/rods or internal degrees of freedom) provide a common language for background-independent settings and cosmological applications where asymptotic states may be absent. **Entanglement-wedge ideas and modular flow** supply a template for identifying what information is reconstructible from a subsystem and how coarse-graining reorganizes degrees of freedom; even outside holography, the guiding principle is to track which entanglement features survive RG and which are artifacts of a particular regulator. On the “hard observable” side, **scattering/IR observables** remain the cleanest operational objects in asymptotically flat contexts, while **cosmological correlators** play an analogous role for early-universe tests. The synthesis emphasizes a practical rule: comparisons should be stated in terms of *dimensionless* or *scale-separated* quantities (e.g., ratios of correlators, spectral tilts, mutual-information scaling with region size, decoherence-rate scaling with controlled potentials), because those are the most robust against differing conventions for state normalization, discretization, and measure factors.\n\nEmpirically, the realistic constraint landscape is uneven but actionable once cast in this minimal observable set. **Cosmology** constrains primordial correlators and consistency relations, and—most importantly for cross-approach work—tests whether coarse-grained predictions remain approximately local, Gaussian, and adiabatic, or instead display nonlocal/nonperturbative signatures that would falsify “GR + small corrections” assumptions. **Gravitational waves** probe propagation and dispersion over cosmological baselines, potentially constraining accumulated phase shifts or decoherence-like effects, but require careful separation of source modeling systematics from propagation physics. **Black-hole imaging** (and more broadly, strong-field electromagnetic observations) primarily constrains effective geometry and near-horizon phenomenology; translating that back to microphysics is model-dependent, but it can still exclude large classes of non-universal deviations. On the laboratory side, **tabletop interferometry and entangled-mass experiments** offer a distinctive pathway: if tiny, gravity-sensitive **decoherence patterns** (or entanglement generation/degradation rates) can be isolated from environmental noise, they provide a direct lever on whether spacetime microstructure induces characteristic spectral signatures. Finally, **condensed-matter and analogue platforms** (e.g., Hawking-like emission in fluid/optical analogs) do not test quantum gravity directly, but they *do* test the stability of semiclassical reasoning—especially the robustness of horizon-induced correlations under dispersion, dissipation, and backreaction—making them valuable calibration arenas for what kinds of “Hawking-like” observables survive coarse-graining and which are artifacts of idealized assumptions.\n\nThree comparative case studies illustrate how this operational synthesis enables explicit “conversion factors” between approaches. **Case study 1 (continuum limit / phase structure):** background-independent RG in discrete models replaces geometric length with measures tied to underlying degrees of freedom (e.g., tensor size/rank), using fixed points as candidates for universal continuum limits. The translation to continuum EFT language is: *identify the fixed point and its relevant directions* ↔ *identify the EFT degrees of freedom and the small set of running couplings controlling long-distance observables*. Disagreement points become crisp: one approach may exhibit a fixed point with a viable continuum universality class, while another may flow to a nonlocal or non-semiclassical regime—signaling that semiclassical mapping is not guaranteed. **Case study 2 (black-hole entropy and information):** holographic entanglement-wedge/modular-flow reasoning treats entropy and reconstruction as fundamental, while other approaches may treat horizon entropy as microstate counting in discrete structures. The operational comparator is not the microstate story but the **scaling and robustness of entanglement measures under coarse-graining** (e.g., whether an area-like scaling emerges and how it fails). Here the conversion factor is: “entropy as a geometric surface functional” ↔ “entropy as a coarse-grained count/statistic of underlying degrees of freedom,” with potential mismatches appearing as non-universal subleading terms or nonlocal correlations that would modify information recovery. **Case study 3 (early-universe correlators):** cosmological predictions provide a shared output space across fundamentally different microphysics. The translation is: “microscopic discreteness/nonlocality parameters” ↔ “shape and scale dependence of correlators (and induced decoherence/noise)” after RG/coarse-graining. Agreement is established when distinct models reduce to the same limited set of correlator templates in the semiclassical regime; disagreement is meaningful when a model predicts departures that cannot be absorbed into small local corrections—e.g., distinctive non-Gaussian shapes, anomalous scale dependence, or decoherence-like spectral features. Across all three case studies, the common lesson is that progress hinges less on adopting a single formalism and more on enforcing *operational comparability*: explicit coarse-graining maps, explicit observable definitions, and clearly stated domains where semiclassical assumptions are (or are not) justified.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## IV. OPEN PROBLEMS, RESEARCH AGENDA, AND EXECUTION PLAN\n\n## IV. Open Problems, Research Agenda, and Execution Plan\n\nThe synthesis converges on a small set of cross-cutting *technical* open problems that currently block “emergence” narratives from becoming controlled, comparable pipelines across quantum-gravity programs. First is **universality and continuum-limit control**: across asymptotic safety (FRG fixed points), spin foams/LQG (background-independent coarse-graining aimed at diffeomorphism restoration), GFT/tensorial models (phase structure/condensation), and holography/tensor networks (radial direction as coarse-graining), the shared question is whether distinct microscopic models flow to the *same* infrared (IR) effective theory—GR + QFT matter—under a well-defined notion of scale without background metric. Second is **matter/gauge coupling and robustness**: many approaches can define “pure gravity” sectors or kinematical states, but the decisive tests require coupling to realistic matter and gauge fields and checking that (i) anomalies are controlled, (ii) effective equivalence principle behavior appears, and (iii) universality classes persist when matter is included. Third is the **Lorentzian vs Euclidean tension** and the coupled problem of **unitarity/causality**: Euclidean tools (lattice/stat mech analogies; FRG in Euclidean signature) are powerful, but the target physics is Lorentzian with causal structure; the roadmap therefore treats “Wick rotation” and reflection-positivity/unitarity as explicit decision points rather than assumed formal steps. Fourth is **emergence of locality**: the synthesis repeatedly flags that different “geometry reconstruction” targets—mutual-information graphs, correlator-decay distances, entropy-scaling curvature proxies, and stricter RT/QECC-consistent “metric consistency” objects—can agree in ideal limits yet diverge under finite size, mixed states, or decoherence; without stability bounds and noise-aware null tests, “locality/curvature change” may be explainable as environment-induced correlation reshaping. Finally, there is the **definition of observables** (and what is actually comparable across programs): relational observables in background-independent settings, boundary amplitudes and reconstruction fidelity in holography/QECC, and operational correlators/entropies in simulators must be brought under a single reporting contract (units, regimes, uncertainty propagation), which is precisely what the translation-layer approach is designed to enforce.\n\n**0–36 month research agenda (prioritized) with milestones, deliverables, and decision points.** The execution plan is organized around RG/coarse-graining as the “common interface,” with each milestone producing reproducible artifacts (schemas, benchmark outputs, and CI-checked pipelines), not just narratives. **(0–6 months)** *Benchmark foundations*: (D1) finalize `translation_layer_v0_2` as a living contract that forces regime tags (Lorentzian/Euclidean, pure/mixed, finite-size scaling, noise model) and standardizes a minimal observable menu (mutual-information profiles, Rényi proxies, entanglement spectrum fragments, reconstruction fidelity, and at least one symmetry/locality diagnostic); (D2) ship a “toy-state suite” (MERA-like, random circuits, thermofield-double analogs) with expected relationships and failure modes, plus a noise layer (filter-function/noise-spectroscopy metadata) so geometry inference can be falsified under calibrated decoherence. **Decision point DP1 (end of month 6):** do the observables and regime tags suffice to make cross-program claims auditable (i.e., do we catch missing assumptions automatically)? **(6–18 months)** *Continuum and universality case studies*: (D3) implement two end-to-end case studies that each produce an RG-style flow object and a continuum diagnostic: (i) spin-foam/LQG coarse-graining and symmetry-restoration indicators (building on the 2018–2025 shift toward background-independent renormalization), and (ii) one continuum FRG/asymptotic-safety or TGFT/GFT phase-structure pipeline; both must export comparable “flow summaries” (fixed-point evidence, relevant directions/phase transitions, and an observable bundle). **DP2 (end of month 18):** is there evidence of regulator/triangulation/discretization *insensitivity* at the level of benchmark observables, or do results remain scheme-dependent? **(18–36 months)** *Lorentzian/causality + matter coupling integration*: (D4) add a Lorentzian consistency layer—unitarity/reflection-positivity checks where applicable; causal-structure diagnostics where not—and extend at least one case study to include matter/gauge couplings with explicit anomaly/consistency reporting; (D5) produce a cross-program “commuting diagram” demonstration: coarse-grain first then reconstruct geometry vs reconstruct then coarse-grain, and quantify when these commute (within errors) as the operational criterion for “geometry emerges stably under RG.” **DP3 (end of month 30–36):** either (a) we can identify at least one plausible universality class with controlled continuum + Lorentzian consistency signals across ≥2 approaches, or (b) we document irreducible divergences and tighten the benchmark suite to discriminate them rather than smoothing them over.\n\n**Assignment matrix, compute/tooling needs, collaboration targets, and handoff checklist.** *Writing leads / technical leads* should mirror the agenda to keep deliverables coupled to reproducible artifacts: (i) **Open-problems synthesis & observables**—Writing Lead: report editor; Technical Lead: translation-layer maintainer (owns `translation_layer_v0_2`, schema rules, and normalization disclaimers). (ii) **Continuum/universality case study A (spin foams/LQG)**—Writing Lead: LQG-focused author; Technical Lead: `sf_gft_diagnostics` maintainer (owns extraction of coarse-graining flows and diffeo-restoration diagnostics; exportable API via the package initializer noted in the introspection artifacts). (iii) **Case study B (FRG/asymptotic safety or TGFT/GFT)**—Writing Lead: QFT/RG specialist; Technical Lead: pipeline engineer (owns deterministic runs, parameter sweeps, and golden outputs). (iv) **Lorentzian/unitarity + matter coupling integration**—Writing Lead: foundations/causality specialist; Technical Lead: methods lead (owns reflection-positivity/unitarity tests, causal diagnostics, and coupling/anomaly reporting). Compute needs are modest at first (CI + small numerics), then rise for parameter sweeps: **Phase 1** requires standard CI runners plus deterministic Python tooling (pytest, pinned env, golden artifacts); **Phase 2** needs access to CPU-heavy sweeps and possibly GPU for tensor-network contractions / learned multiscale bases, with strict seed control and tolerance-aware diffs; **Phase 3** adds longer runs and storage for versioned artifacts (content-addressed outputs, provenance manifests). Collaboration targets should be explicit: (a) *Handbook of Quantum Gravity* chapter authors for canonical definitions of continuum limits/observables (to reduce terminological drift), (b) spin-foam coarse-graining groups (for symmetry-restoration diagnostics), (c) FRG/asymptotic-safety and TGFT groups (for fixed-point/phase-structure comparators), and (d) quantum-simulation/noise-spectroscopy teams (to make the nuisance/noise layer realistic rather than cosmetic). Finally, the **handoff checklist for research agents** is: collect missing anchor references (especially on Lorentzian continuation/unitarity criteria and matter-coupled continuum diagnostics), populate benchmark datasets (toy states, noise models, reference outputs), deliver replication packages (code + configs + environment lock + golden artifacts), and log *gap tickets* whenever a claim cannot be expressed in the translation schema (missing regime tags, undefined observable normalization, absent uncertainty propagation). This checklist operationalizes the synthesis’s central methodological claim: cross-approach comparison is only meaningful when “continuum recovery,” “locality,” and “observables” are enforced as auditable contracts, not treated as shared intuition.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Lack of a shared, quantitative catalog of cross-approach observables and benchmarks. The roadmap needs a concrete mapping between theory-specific variables (e.g., spin-network spectra, causal set order densities, asymptotic safety scaling exponents, string-theory moduli/compactification parameters) and operational observables (e.g., modified dispersion relations, gravitational-wave imprints, cosmological correlators, black-hole quasi-normal modes). Unanswered questions: Which minimal set of observables can discriminate between major approaches at feasible sensitivities? What are standard units/normalizations and error models to report results across approaches? Are there canonical numerical benchmark problems (finite-size, finite-precision) for testing coarse-graining and renormalization flows that every approach can run and compare? Concrete data needed: explicit formulae translating approach-specific outputs into common observable space, error budgets, and recommended benchmark problem definitions.\n- Gap 2: Insufficient comparative analysis and shared testbeds for renormalization/coarse-graining methods. Current synthesis lacks systematic, side-by-side evaluations of truncation schemes, regulator choices, continuum limits, and numerical algorithms used in different communities (functional RG, tensor-network coarse-graining, Monte Carlo RG in lattice gravity, group-field-theory condensate approximations, causal-set coarse-graining). Unanswered questions: How do convergence rates, stability, and universality-class identification compare across methods when applied to the same simplified models? What are agreed metrics (e.g., critical exponents, scaling collapse quality, computational cost vs. accuracy) for method comparison? Concrete data needed: runnable reference codes, small standardized models (2D/3D analogues), and cross-validated numerical results to quantify method offsets and systematic errors.\n- Gap 3: Weak operational/empirical bridge—missing concrete experimental proposals and prior ranges linking theory parameters to observational forecasts. The review needs end-to-end pipelines from model classes to instrument-level forecasts (including signal models, backgrounds, and parameter posteriors) and clear statements of which near-term/medium-term experiments can constrain which theory spaces. Unanswered questions: For each approach or broad class of models, what are realistic priors on key parameters? What is the sensitivity of planned observatories (LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA upgrades, LISA, CMB-S4, PTA, cosmic-ray/astroparticle detectors) to the most discriminatory signatures? Concrete data needed: likelihood functions/forward-model codes, Fisher-matrix or mock-PE studies for representative models, and a prioritized list of experimental programs with expected timeline and detectable parameter ranges.\n\n","nodeId":null,"timestamp":"2025-12-22T22:36:01.457Z","memoryStorageFailed":true},{"type":"synthesis_report","content":"# SYNTHESIS REPORT\n\n**Mission:** Produce a complete, submission‑ready detailed outline and annotated bibliography for the Cross‑Approach Quantum‑Gravity Review & Roadmap.

The central finding is that the field has matured program‑internally (with strong, approach‑specific toolchains), but remains bottlenecked at the synthesis level by incompatible notions of “scale,” “observable,” and “continuum limit.” Where cross‑program alignment is strongest, it is driven by **operationally defined observables** (e.g., entanglement and relative entropy, spectral/diffusion dimension, coarse‑grained geometry correlators, S‑matrix/EFT data), and by shared RG language (universality classes, fixed points, and effective descriptions). The report’s key value is an actionable map of *translation conventions*—how to compare calculations that do not share variables, kinematics, or even background structures—so that claims of “emergence of geometry,” “unitarity,” or “UV completion” become testable and mutually interpretable rather than program‑relative.\n\nThe roadmap identifies a small set of cross‑cutting blockers and corresponding high‑leverage research priorities. Technically, the main obstacles are (1) **universality and controlled continuum limits** for discrete/algebraic approaches; (2) **gauge‑invariant coarse‑graining** and the construction of comparable, renormalized observables; (3) **dynamics of entanglement and modular flow** as a shared substrate for emergent spacetime claims (especially in holography and tensor‑network/QI approaches) and their connection to semiclassical gravity; and (4) **precision matching to EFT and phenomenology**, including robustness to field redefinitions and scheme dependence. The execution plan emphasizes establishing benchmark problems (e.g., black‑hole information diagnostics, cosmological perturbations from candidate microdynamics, RG flows reproducing semiclassical GR, and consistency conditions from causality/positivity), building shared data and code standards for coarse‑graining pipelines, and prioritizing “bridge results” that simultaneously constrain multiple approaches. The outcome is a practical, comparative research agenda aimed at converting qualitative emergence narratives into **controlled, reproducible pipelines** with clear interfaces to observation and to one another.\n\n---\n\n## I. FRAMING THE CROSS-APPROACH QUANTUM-GRAVITY ROADMAP\n\n## I. Framing the Cross-Approach Quantum-Gravity Roadmap\n\nA persistent feature of the 2020–2025 quantum-gravity literature is that, despite many excellent program-specific reviews, it remains difficult to identify a *single* synthesis that spans the full landscape—string theory and holography, loop quantum gravity (LQG) and spin foams, causal dynamical triangulations (CDT), causal sets, group field theory (GFT), and asymptotic safety—in a way that is simultaneously technically meaningful and operationally comparative. What *has* emerged instead are cross-cutting “mapping” contributions and special-issue framings that treat multiple approaches through shared themes, with **renormalization and coarse graining** repeatedly singled out as the most productive unifying thread. This roadmap adopts that premise explicitly: rather than attempting an encyclopedic survey of each program, it asks how each one implements a common agenda—**connecting microscopic degrees of freedom to an emergent semiclassical spacetime and, ultimately, to empirical contact**—and it uses renormalization-group (RG) ideas, continuum limits, and phase structure as the main comparative language.\n\nThe scope is therefore defined around a small number of *success criteria* that are meaningful across otherwise incommensurate frameworks. (1) **A well-posed notion of scale and flow:** a Wilsonian RG map, functional RG (FRG) equation, refinement/coarsening scheme, or an equivalent mechanism that relates descriptions at different resolutions. (2) **A controlled continuum/semi-classical regime:** either an interacting UV fixed point with a finite number of relevant directions (as targeted in asymptotic safety via FRG flows, often discussed in terms of a Reuter-type fixed point and predictivity from few UV-relevant couplings), or a critical point/second-order transition in a discrete model that supports a continuum limit (as pursued in CDT and increasingly in spin-foam/GFT coarse-graining programs). (3) **Symmetries and constraints at large scales:** in particular, the recovery (or effective realization) of diffeomorphism invariance or its discrete/dual counterpart, which has become a focal diagnostic in background-independent coarse graining—e.g., the recent spin-foam shift from largely kinematical achievements toward continuum recovery via explicit renormalization and attempts to restore effective diffeomorphism symmetry. (4) **A route to observables and phenomenology:** whether via boundary observables and amplitudes (spin foams), correlation functions and effective actions (FRG/asymptotic safety), large-scale geometric observables and scaling dimensions (CDT), or holographic observables where a dual quantum system defines the theory nonperturbatively (string-based/holographic settings).\n\nWithin this framing, the roadmap organizes the field into two renormalization “families” that have consolidated over the past decade while remaining conceptually aligned. On the **continuum side**, asymptotic safety operationalizes RG with FRG flows for an effective average action, searching for UV fixed points and charting trajectories into infrared semiclassical regimes, increasingly including **gravity–matter systems** and richer truncations. On the **discrete/coarse-graining side**, spin foams, tensor-network-inspired spin-net/foam renormalization, GFT, and CDT build RG notions from **refinement and blocking transformations on discrete structures**, often diagnosing candidate continuum limits through **phase diagrams and critical behavior** (frequently numerically), using criticality as a proxy for divergent correlation lengths and emergent continuum physics. The key point is not to declare a winner but to make comparisons actionable: both families are best understood as different implementations of Wilsonian thinking under different constraints (background independence, discretization choices, availability of a dual description), and both increasingly use the same diagnostic vocabulary—flows, fixed points, universality classes, and emergent symmetries—to benchmark progress.\n\nTo support consistent cross-reading, the remainder of this report standardizes terminology and comparison dimensions used in each subsequent case study. We characterize each approach by (i) **degrees of freedom** (fields/metrics, connections and holonomies, simplicial geometries, causal order, group-valued data, boundary CFT operators), (ii) **dynamics** (path integrals and amplitudes, Hamiltonian/constraint implementations, FRG equations, transfer matrices, sum-over-histories rules), (iii) **symmetries/constraints** (diffeomorphisms and their discrete realizations, gauge constraints, locality/nonlocality), (iv) **observables** (correlators, boundary amplitudes, spectral/hausdorff dimensions, entanglement, S-matrix/bootstrapped data where available), (v) **continuum limit criteria** (UV fixed point vs. second-order transition/critical line, universality and scaling), (vi) **matter coupling** (minimal coupling, induced interactions, consistency constraints), and (vii) **empirical contact** (cosmology, black-hole physics, effective field theory matching, robustness under truncations/discretizations). An at-a-glance map at the end of this section links each program to later “testbeds” used throughout the roadmap—e.g., phase-structure studies (CDT and spin-foam/GFT), fixed-point and predictivity analyses (asymptotic safety), and symmetry-recovery diagnostics (background-independent coarse graining)—so that readers from different communities can locate where their familiar tools enter the shared renormalization-and-emergence narrative.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## II. APPROACH-SPECIFIC EXPOSITIONS THROUGH THE RENORMALIZATION/COARSE-GRAINING LENS\n\n## II. Approach-Specific Expositions Through the Renormalization/Coarse-Graining Lens\n\nAcross quantum-gravity programs, “renormalization/coarse graining” is less a single technique than a *translation layer* between microscopic degrees of freedom (discrete, algebraic, or field-theoretic) and emergent semiclassical spacetime. Two broad families of implementations dominate the 2015–2025 consolidation: **(i) continuum Wilsonian flows** (most explicitly in **Effective Field Theory (EFT)** and **Asymptotic Safety** via functional RG methods), and **(ii) discrete/background-independent coarse graining** (spin foams/spin nets, **Group Field Theory (GFT)/tensor models**, **Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)**, and, more conceptually, **causal sets**). In both families, *scale* is not merely a momentum cutoff: it may be a coarse-graining step on a complex, a representation label (spin), a tensor-network blocking depth, a diffusion time (spectral dimension), or a parameter controlling refinement. The unifying question is the same: **which RG trajectories and phases yield an extended, approximately diffeomorphism-invariant, semiclassical regime, and what observables certify that regime?** This lens also highlights a practical convergence: modern work increasingly relies on *phase diagrams, fixed points, and universality* as proxies for continuum limits—even when the microscopic formulation is not a standard local QFT.\n\n### Continuum EFT and Asymptotic Safety: RG flow as definition of “UV completion”\nIn **gravitational EFT**, one assumes that at scales well below a cutoff (often near the Planck scale), the dynamics is described by the Einstein–Hilbert term plus higher-curvature operators with coefficients organized by power counting. Here *scale* is the usual Wilsonian RG scale (momentum/energy), and coarse graining integrates out fluctuations above that scale. Renormalization is “successful” in the EFT sense: divergences are absorbed into higher-dimension operators, and the outputs are **controlled low-energy effective actions**, scattering amplitudes and **quantum corrections to classical potentials**, and curvature-expansion predictions with quantified truncation errors. EFT does not, by itself, specify a UV completion; it instead provides a systematic interface between any UV theory and infrared observables.\n\n**Asymptotic Safety** elevates the RG flow from an interface to a *nonperturbative definition* of the theory: one searches (typically with the **Functional Renormalization Group (FRG)**) for an **interacting UV fixed point** (often called the Reuter fixed point) with **a finite number of UV-relevant directions**, yielding predictivity. The fundamental variables in common truncations are the metric (or fields equivalent under reparameterizations), with couplings promoted to scale-dependent quantities; the key technical object is the effective average action \\(\\Gamma_k\\), interpolating between bare and full effective action as \\(k\\) is lowered. Renormalization status is comparatively mature: extensive evidence for nontrivial fixed points across truncations and in gravity–matter systems, plus a growing emphasis on **phase structure**, scheme dependence, and the mapping from RG trajectories to semiclassical regimes. Concrete outputs include scale-dependent Newton and cosmological couplings, higher-derivative operator flows, approximate **critical exponents** (UV-relevant directions), and candidate **effective actions** usable for cosmology and black-hole phenomenology—always with the caveat that robustness must be tested against truncation enlargement and field-parameterization choices.\n\n### Spin foams/LQG and background-independent coarse graining: refinement, cylindrical consistency, and restoration of symmetries\nIn **Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)** and **spin foams**, the microscopic degrees of freedom are combinatorial/algebraic: **holonomies and fluxes**, or equivalently **spin-network states** (graphs labeled by group representations and intertwiners), and spin-foam amplitudes defined on 2-complexes. “Scale” is not a background momentum; it is typically encoded via **graph/complex refinement**, representation labels (spins), or boundary data resolution. Coarse graining is therefore implemented as **maps between discretizations** (refinement/coarsening) designed to preserve physical predictions—an analogue of Wilsonian block-spinning, but in a background-independent setting.\n\nRenormalization in this sector has shifted (notably 2018–2025) from mainly kinematical achievements toward **continuum recovery**: defining RG flows on families of complexes, using **tensor-network renormalization (TNR)** and related numerical schemes for spin nets/foams, and diagnosing whether effective dynamics restores approximate **diffeomorphism symmetry** at large scales. Fixed points correspond to discretization-independent (“perfect”) amplitudes or topological phases; phase diagrams can reveal transitions between degenerate/branched-polymer–like behavior and extended geometric regimes. Concrete outputs are often *not* conventional correlation functions but include: effective boundary amplitudes, coarse-grained face/edge weights, emergent constraints, and spectral probes (e.g., scaling of geometric operators). The long-term target is a controlled continuum limit where semiclassical geometries dominate and gravitational propagators/low-energy effective actions can be extracted from the spin-foam path integral.\n\n### CDT, GFT/tensor models, string/AdS-CFT, causal sets, and emergent/information-theoretic approaches: phases, dual RGs, and entanglement as coarse graining\n**Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT)** defines the gravitational path integral as a sum over **causal triangulations** with a preferred foliation structure (in standard implementations). Here “scale” is set by the triangulation lattice spacing and the number of simplices; coarse graining is pursued via **statistical-mechanical phase structure** and continuum extrapolations near critical surfaces. Renormalization is chiefly empirical/numerical: one maps a phase diagram (including extended “de Sitter–like” phases) and searches for second-order transitions that could support a continuum limit. Outputs include measured large-scale geometry (effective minisuperspace actions), **spectral dimension flow**, and scaling relations interpreted as effective continuum physics.\n\n**Group Field Theory (GFT)** and **tensor models** provide a QFT-like completion of spin-foam ideas: the fundamental variables are fields on group manifolds (GFT) or combinatorial tensors (tensor models), whose Feynman diagrams generate labeled complexes. Scale can be introduced via representation/momentum on the group, tensor sizes/ranks, or FRG cutoffs adapted to these nonlocal combinatorial interactions. Renormalization is explicit: power counting, beta functions, and **FRG flows** have been developed in a “theory space” of interactions, enabling the identification of fixed points and phases. A distinctive coarse-graining target is **condensation/collective phases** where many quanta of geometry yield emergent continuum spacetimes (e.g., cosmological effective dynamics from condensates). Outputs include beta functions, universality classes, effective (hydrodynamic) equations for condensate order parameters, and phase diagrams linking microscopic couplings to emergent dimensionality and geometry.\n\nIn **string theory**, coarse graining appears in multiple guises: worldsheet RG (as a consistency condition), spacetime EFT, and—most sharply—**holography (AdS/CFT)**, where the **radial direction** corresponds to an RG scale in the dual QFT. The “fundamental variables” depend on the formulation (strings/branes vs. boundary CFT operators), but the coarse-graining story is unusually concrete: boundary Wilsonian RG flows map to bulk radial evolution, and **entanglement measures** (e.g., entropy, modular Hamiltonians) become geometric via holographic relations. Renormalization status is nonperturbatively strongest where a dual CFT exists, while “fixed points” correspond to conformal theories and “flows” to domain-wall geometries. Outputs include boundary correlators at strong coupling, operator spectra, entanglement entropies, transport coefficients, and effective bulk actions (including higher-curvature corrections) inferred from CFT data.\n\n**Causal sets** posit that the fundamental structure is a locally finite **partial order** capturing causal relations, with scale related to *density* (discreteness scale) and to coarse-graining via random thinning or order-preserving maps. Renormalization is less standardized but naturally framed as defining effective dynamics under coarse-graining of the order. Outputs often emphasize kinematic and spectral diagnostics (dimension estimators, nonlocal d’Alembertian operators, causal-set Green functions) and phenomenological constraints, while the central open issue remains a robust continuum limit and a fully developed RG/fixed-point picture akin to other discrete approaches.\n\nFinally, **emergent-gravity/information-theoretic approaches** treat geometry as collective, with coarse graining often defined in terms of **entanglement structure**, quantum error correction, or complexity. Here “scale” may be an entanglement renormalization depth (tensor networks/MERA-like constructions) or an information-theoretic resolution parameter. Renormalization manifests as flow of effective descriptions under entanglement coarse graining; outputs are entanglement entropies, mutual informations, modular-flow data, and (in favorable cases) emergent effective gravitational equations or constraints consistent with semiclassical gravity. These approaches frequently interface with holography, where the RG/geometry dictionary is explicit and can serve as a benchmark for more speculative emergent scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Standardized “Approach Cards” (for direct comparability)\n\n### 1) Gravitational EFT\n- **Core postulates:** GR is the leading term in a controlled low-energy expansion;

OPERATIONAL, EMPIRICAL, AND COMPARATIVE SYNTHESIS\n\n## III. Operational, Empirical, and Comparative Synthesis\n\nA cross-approach comparison program in quantum gravity (and gravity-adjacent approaches) becomes operational only once *observables* and *translation conventions* are made explicit. The most robust bridge identified across communities is **RG/coarse-graining as a shared “translation layer”** from microscopic kinematics (discrete, algebraic, or emergent degrees of freedom) to an effective semiclassical description. In this framing, the primary question is not “which fundamental variables are correct?”, but “what are the *universal* long-distance predictions after coarse-graining, and what minimal set of measurements (or proxies) can test them?” This motivates a compact menu of operational benchmarks that are comparatively portable: (i) **correlators** (in-in cosmological correlators, response functions, scattering/IR observables where applicable), (ii) **entanglement measures** (entropy/mutual information and their coarse-grained variants, in spirit aligned with entanglement-wedge/modular-flow thinking even when no AdS boundary exists), and (iii) **decoherence/noise spectra** in controlled quantum systems, analyzed via power spectral densities and filter-function methods so that theory inputs become *spectral scaling statements* rather than program-specific normalizations. Crucially, the synthesis also highlights a major limitation: many pipelines implicitly assume a smooth semiclassical limit “GR + small local corrections.” For discrete, background-independent, or intrinsically nonlocal approaches, the existence (and universality class) of such a limit is itself a hypothesis; without establishing it, mapping microscopic parameters to macroscopic observables can be ill-posed or non-unique.\n\nWithin this operational framing, several information-theoretic tools serve as comparators even when their native formulations differ. **Relational observables** (defined with respect to physical clocks/rods or internal degrees of freedom) provide a common language for background-independent settings and cosmological applications where asymptotic states may be absent. **Entanglement-wedge ideas and modular flow** supply a template for identifying what information is reconstructible from a subsystem and how coarse-graining reorganizes degrees of freedom; even outside holography, the guiding principle is to track which entanglement features survive RG and which are artifacts of a particular regulator. On the “hard observable” side, **scattering/IR observables** remain the cleanest operational objects in asymptotically flat contexts, while **cosmological correlators** play an analogous role for early-universe tests. The synthesis emphasizes a practical rule: comparisons should be stated in terms of *dimensionless* or *scale-separated* quantities (e.g., ratios of correlators, spectral tilts, mutual-information scaling with region size, decoherence-rate scaling with controlled potentials), because those are the most robust against differing conventions for state normalization, discretization, and measure factors.\n\nEmpirically, the realistic constraint landscape is uneven but actionable once cast in this minimal observable set. **Cosmology** constrains primordial correlators and consistency relations, and—most importantly for cross-approach work—tests whether coarse-grained predictions remain approximately local, Gaussian, and adiabatic, or instead display nonlocal/nonperturbative signatures that would falsify “GR + small corrections” assumptions. **Gravitational waves** probe propagation and dispersion over cosmological baselines, potentially constraining accumulated phase shifts or decoherence-like effects, but require careful separation of source modeling systematics from propagation physics. **Black-hole imaging** (and more broadly, strong-field electromagnetic observations) primarily constrains effective geometry and near-horizon phenomenology; translating that back to microphysics is model-dependent, but it can still exclude large classes of non-universal deviations. On the laboratory side, **tabletop interferometry and entangled-mass experiments** offer a distinctive pathway: if tiny, gravity-sensitive **decoherence patterns** (or entanglement generation/degradation rates) can be isolated from environmental noise, they provide a direct lever on whether spacetime microstructure induces characteristic spectral signatures. Finally, **condensed-matter and analogue platforms** (e.g., Hawking-like emission in fluid/optical analogs) do not test quantum gravity directly, but they *do* test the stability of semiclassical reasoning—especially the robustness of horizon-induced correlations under dispersion, dissipation, and backreaction—making them valuable calibration arenas for what kinds of “Hawking-like” observables survive coarse-graining and which are artifacts of idealized assumptions.\n\nThree comparative case studies illustrate how this operational synthesis enables explicit “conversion factors” between approaches. **Case study 1 (continuum limit / phase structure):** background-independent RG in discrete models replaces geometric length with measures tied to underlying degrees of freedom (e.g., tensor size/rank), using fixed points as candidates for universal continuum limits. The translation to continuum EFT language is: *identify the fixed point and its relevant directions* ↔ *identify the EFT degrees of freedom and the small set of running couplings controlling long-distance observables*. Disagreement points become crisp: one approach may exhibit a fixed point with a viable continuum universality class, while another may flow to a nonlocal or non-semiclassical regime—signaling that semiclassical mapping is not guaranteed. **Case study 2 (black-hole entropy and information):** holographic entanglement-wedge/modular-flow reasoning treats entropy and reconstruction as fundamental, while other approaches may treat horizon entropy as microstate counting in discrete structures. The operational comparator is not the microstate story but the **scaling and robustness of entanglement measures under coarse-graining** (e.g., whether an area-like scaling emerges and how it fails). Here the conversion factor is: “entropy as a geometric surface functional” ↔ “entropy as a coarse-grained count/statistic of underlying degrees of freedom,” with potential mismatches appearing as non-universal subleading terms or nonlocal correlations that would modify information recovery. **Case study 3 (early-universe correlators):** cosmological predictions provide a shared output space across fundamentally different microphysics. The translation is: “microscopic discreteness/nonlocality parameters” ↔ “shape and scale dependence of correlators (and induced decoherence/noise)” after RG/coarse-graining. Agreement is established when distinct models reduce to the same limited set of correlator templates in the semiclassical regime; disagreement is meaningful when a model predicts departures that cannot be absorbed into small local corrections—e.g., distinctive non-Gaussian shapes, anomalous scale dependence, or decoherence-like spectral features. Across all three case studies, the common lesson is that progress hinges less on adopting a single formalism and more on enforcing *operational comparability*: explicit coarse-graining maps, explicit observable definitions, and clearly stated domains where semiclassical assumptions are (or are not) justified.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## IV. OPEN PROBLEMS, RESEARCH AGENDA, AND EXECUTION PLAN\n\n## IV. Open Problems, Research Agenda, and Execution Plan\n\nThe synthesis converges on a small set of cross-cutting *technical* open problems that currently block “emergence” narratives from becoming controlled, comparable pipelines across quantum-gravity programs. First is **universality and continuum-limit control**: across asymptotic safety (FRG fixed points), spin foams/LQG (background-independent coarse-graining aimed at diffeomorphism restoration), GFT/tensorial models (phase structure/condensation), and holography/tensor networks (radial direction as coarse-graining), the shared question is whether distinct microscopic models flow to the *same* infrared (IR) effective theory—GR + QFT matter—under a well-defined notion of scale without background metric. Second is **matter/gauge coupling and robustness**: many approaches can define “pure gravity” sectors or kinematical states, but the decisive tests require coupling to realistic matter and gauge fields and checking that (i) anomalies are controlled, (ii) effective equivalence principle behavior appears, and (iii) universality classes persist when matter is included. Third is the **Lorentzian vs Euclidean tension** and the coupled problem of **unitarity/causality**: Euclidean tools (lattice/stat mech analogies; FRG in Euclidean signature) are powerful, but the target physics is Lorentzian with causal structure; the roadmap therefore treats “Wick rotation” and reflection-positivity/unitarity as explicit decision points rather than assumed formal steps. Fourth is **emergence of locality**: the synthesis repeatedly flags that different “geometry reconstruction” targets—mutual-information graphs, correlator-decay distances, entropy-scaling curvature proxies, and stricter RT/QECC-consistent “metric consistency” objects—can agree in ideal limits yet diverge under finite size, mixed states, or decoherence; without stability bounds and noise-aware null tests, “locality/curvature change” may be explainable as environment-induced correlation reshaping. Finally, there is the **definition of observables** (and what is actually comparable across programs): relational observables in background-independent settings, boundary amplitudes and reconstruction fidelity in holography/QECC, and operational correlators/entropies in simulators must be brought under a single reporting contract (units, regimes, uncertainty propagation), which is precisely what the translation-layer approach is designed to enforce.\n\n**0–36 month research agenda (prioritized) with milestones, deliverables, and decision points.** The execution plan is organized around RG/coarse-graining as the “common interface,” with each milestone producing reproducible artifacts (schemas, benchmark outputs, and CI-checked pipelines), not just narratives. **(0–6 months)** *Benchmark foundations*: (D1) finalize `translation_layer_v0_2` as a living contract that forces regime tags (Lorentzian/Euclidean, pure/mixed, finite-size scaling, noise model) and standardizes a minimal observable menu (mutual-information profiles, Rényi proxies, entanglement spectrum fragments, reconstruction fidelity, and at least one symmetry/locality diagnostic); (D2) ship a “toy-state suite” (MERA-like, random circuits, thermofield-double analogs) with expected relationships and failure modes, plus a noise layer (filter-function/noise-spectroscopy metadata) so geometry inference can be falsified under calibrated decoherence. **Decision point DP1 (end of month 6):** do the observables and regime tags suffice to make cross-program claims auditable (i.e., do we catch missing assumptions automatically)? **(6–18 months)** *Continuum and universality case studies*: (D3) implement two end-to-end case studies that each produce an RG-style flow object and a continuum diagnostic: (i) spin-foam/LQG coarse-graining and symmetry-restoration indicators (building on the 2018–2025 shift toward background-independent renormalization), and (ii) one continuum FRG/asymptotic-safety or TGFT/GFT phase-structure pipeline; both must export comparable “flow summaries” (fixed-point evidence, relevant directions/phase transitions, and an observable bundle). **DP2 (end of month 18):** is there evidence of regulator/triangulation/discretization *insensitivity* at the level of benchmark observables, or do results remain scheme-dependent? **(18–36 months)** *Lorentzian/causality + matter coupling integration*: (D4) add a Lorentzian consistency layer—unitarity/reflection-positivity checks where applicable; causal-structure diagnostics where not—and extend at least one case study to include matter/gauge couplings with explicit anomaly/consistency reporting; (D5) produce a cross-program “commuting diagram” demonstration: coarse-grain first then reconstruct geometry vs reconstruct then coarse-grain, and quantify when these commute (within errors) as the operational criterion for “geometry emerges stably under RG.” **DP3 (end of month 30–36):** either (a) we can identify at least one plausible universality class with controlled continuum + Lorentzian consistency signals across ≥2 approaches, or (b) we document irreducible divergences and tighten the benchmark suite to discriminate them rather than smoothing them over.\n\n**Assignment matrix, compute/tooling needs, collaboration targets, and handoff checklist.** *Writing leads / technical leads* should mirror the agenda to keep deliverables coupled to reproducible artifacts: (i) **Open-problems synthesis & observables**—Writing Lead: report editor; Technical Lead: translation-layer maintainer (owns `translation_layer_v0_2`, schema rules, and normalization disclaimers). (ii) **Continuum/universality case study A (spin foams/LQG)**—Writing Lead: LQG-focused author; Technical Lead: `sf_gft_diagnostics` maintainer (owns extraction of coarse-graining flows and diffeo-restoration diagnostics; exportable API via the package initializer noted in the introspection artifacts). (iii) **Case study B (FRG/asymptotic safety or TGFT/GFT)**—Writing Lead: QFT/RG specialist; Technical Lead: pipeline engineer (owns deterministic runs, parameter sweeps, and golden outputs). (iv) **Lorentzian/unitarity + matter coupling integration**—Writing Lead: foundations/causality specialist; Technical Lead: methods lead (owns reflection-positivity/unitarity tests, causal diagnostics, and coupling/anomaly reporting). Compute needs are modest at first (CI + small numerics), then rise for parameter sweeps: **Phase 1** requires standard CI runners plus deterministic Python tooling (pytest, pinned env, golden artifacts); **Phase 2** needs access to CPU-heavy sweeps and possibly GPU for tensor-network contractions / learned multiscale bases, with strict seed control and tolerance-aware diffs; **Phase 3** adds longer runs and storage for versioned artifacts (content-addressed outputs, provenance manifests). Collaboration targets should be explicit: (a) *Handbook of Quantum Gravity* chapter authors for canonical definitions of continuum limits/observables (to reduce terminological drift), (b) spin-foam coarse-graining groups (for symmetry-restoration diagnostics), (c) FRG/asymptotic-safety and TGFT groups (for fixed-point/phase-structure comparators), and (d) quantum-simulation/noise-spectroscopy teams (to make the nuisance/noise layer realistic rather than cosmetic). Finally, the **handoff checklist for research agents** is: collect missing anchor references (especially on Lorentzian continuation/unitarity criteria and matter-coupled continuum diagnostics), populate benchmark datasets (toy states, noise models, reference outputs), deliver replication packages (code + configs + environment lock + golden artifacts), and log *gap tickets* whenever a claim cannot be expressed in the translation schema (missing regime tags, undefined observable normalization, absent uncertainty propagation). This checklist operationalizes the synthesis’s central methodological claim: cross-approach comparison is only meaningful when “continuum recovery,” “locality,” and “observables” are enforced as auditable contracts, not treated as shared intuition.\n\n---\n\n## UNTITLED SECTION\n\n[Section content unavailable]\n\n---\n\n## KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n- Gap 1: Lack of a shared, quantitative catalog of cross-approach observables and benchmarks.

The central finding is that the field has matured program‑internally (with strong, approach‑specific toolchains), but remains bottlenecked at the synthesis level by incompatible notions of “scale,” “observable,” and “continuum limit.” Where cross‑program alignment is strongest, it is driven by **operationally defined observables** (e.g., entanglement and relative entropy, spectral/diffusion dimension, coarse‑grained geometry correlators, S‑matrix/EFT data), and by shared RG language (universality classes, fixed points, and effective descriptions). The report’s key value is an actionable map of *translation conventions*—how to compare calculations that do not share variables, kinematics, or even background structures—so that claims of “emergence of geometry,” “unitarity,” or “UV completion” become testable and mutually interpretable rather than program‑relative.\n\nThe roadmap identifies a small set of cross‑cutting blockers and corresponding high‑leverage research priorities. Technically, the main obstacles are (1) **universality and controlled continuum limits** for discrete/algebraic approaches; (2) **gauge‑invariant coarse‑graining** and the construction of comparable, renormalized observables; (3) **dynamics of entanglement and modular flow** as a shared substrate for emergent spacetime claims (especially in holography and tensor‑network/QI approaches) and their connection to semiclassical gravity; and (4) **precision matching to EFT and phenomenology**, including robustness to field redefinitions and scheme dependence. The execution plan emphasizes establishing benchmark problems (e.g., black‑hole information diagnostics, cosmological perturbations from candidate microdynamics, RG flows reproducing semiclassical GR, and consistency conditions from causality/positivity), building shared data and code standards for coarse‑graining pipelines, and prioritizing “bridge results” that simultaneously constrain multiple approaches. The outcome is a practical, comparative research agenda aimed at converting qualitative emergence narratives into **controlled, reproducible pipelines** with clear interfaces to observation and to one another.","sectionsGenerated":8,"sourcesConsulted":13,"knowledgeGaps":["Gap 1: Lack of a shared, quantitative catalog of cross-approach observables and benchmarks.
