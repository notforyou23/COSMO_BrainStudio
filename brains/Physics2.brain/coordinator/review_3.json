          "Cycle 1 consistency review (divergence 0.95):\nSummary of agreement, conflicts, and recommended next steps.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Decoherence is central: All three branches treat loss of coherence/entanglement as the key mechanism producing apparent classical outcomes rather than a literal “spooky” instantaneous causal force.\n- Open-system viewpoint: Branch 1’s framing of entanglement loss as information leakage into uncontrolled degrees of freedom is consistent with Branch 3’s treatment of decoherence as a noise channel that can be characterized and mitigated.\n- Engineering and measurement matter: Branches 1 and 3 converge on the idea that engineering control (environment engineering, error correction, dynamical decoupling, and noise spectroscopy) is a practical route to preserve/use entanglement and test limits.\n- Testability: All branches imply empirical distinctions — measuring decoherence rates, spectra, and scaling with mass/position/clock energy should discriminate models.\n\n2) Conflicting or tension points\n- Fundamental vs. effective origin:\n  - Branch 1 presents decoherence as an engineering/problem-of-control issue (information flow to environment) implying no new fundamental non-unitary physics.\n  - Branch 2 posits gravity (entanglement with spacetime/gravitational time dilation) as an intrinsic, position-dependent dephasing channel that could impose a fundamental limit on superpositions. That raises the possibility of a decoherence source not removable by standard engineering.\n  - Tension: If Branch 2’s gravity-induced decoherence is real and irreducible, it weakens Branch 1’s optimism that all decoherence can be suppressed by improved engineering/error correction.\n- Scale and observable signature:\n  - Branch 2 predicts a specific ordering (superpositions of “when” decohere before those of “where”) and characteristic dependence on gravitational potential differences; Branches 1/3 make no such specific spacetime-phase predictions.\n  - Branch 3 assumes decoherence is dominated by low-frequency technical noise that is largely controllable; Branch 2 claims an additional (potentially low-frequency but fundamental) dephasing tied to mass/gravity that may not be suppressed by conventional DD/error correction.\n- Mitigation strategies:\n  - Branch 3’s dynamical-decoupling/error-correction tactics may fail against decoherence that arises from coupling to degrees of freedom that are not addressable by control pulses (e.g., true stochastic time-dilation fluctuations tied to spacetime geometry), whereas they work well for classical/engineering noise.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, prioritized)\n- Short-term experimental program (practical, high ROI)\n  1. Characterize and suppress technical noise first:\n     - Perform noise spectroscopy (CPMG, spin-echo, filter-function analysis) to extract power spectral density of qubit/massive-system dephasing.\n     - Implement tailored dynamical decoupling (Uhrig, concatenated, optimized sequences) and quantify coherence extension and residual error budgets.\n     - If residual decoherence after aggressive suppression falls below predicted levels for technical sources, proceed to step 2.\n  2. Search for residual, environment-insensitive decoherence:\n     - Design differential experiments where engineered noise and local environments are held constant while gravitational potential differences are varied (e.g., different heights, gravitationally separated clock states, or mass-superposition interferometers).\n     - Look for decoherence scaling with gravitational potential difference, mass, or clock-rate shifts that cannot be removed by DD or local error correction.\n- Medium-term theoretical work\n  - Build quantitative open-system models that couple matter degrees of freedom to semiclassical gravity and predict decoherence rates, spectral properties, and dependencies (mass, separation, potential difference, frequency dependence).\n  - Compute whether predicted gravity-induced dephasing maps onto experimentally accessible parameter regimes given current/near-term technology.\n  - Determine whether gravity-induced decoherence behaves like low-frequency noise (potentially suppressible by DD) or as an irreducible channel immune to control.\n- Decision criterion / benchmark\n  - If after state-of-the-art noise suppression and error correction, a reproducible decoherence channel remains whose magnitude and scaling match gravity-based predictions (and cannot be attributed to residual technical/systematic sources), elevate Branch 2 to substantive physical effect and adapt control strategies accordingly.\n  - If residuals are consistent with controllable/environmental origins and no gravity signature is found within experimental sensitivity, prioritize engineering (Branch 1/3): push improved isolation, materials, error correction, and DD to extend coherent operation.\n- Practical immediate steps for teams\n  - Implement routine noise spectral characterization and DD on current qubit/mass-superposition platforms.\n  - Design a simple gravity-sensitivity experiment (e.g., interferometer with variable height or a clock-in-superposition test) that can exclude or detect the predicted gravitational dephasing at an achievable sensitivity.\n  - Track and report residuals as functions of control strength and gravitational parameters to provide the empirical evidence needed to adjudicate Branch 2.\n\nBottom line: Branches 1 and 3 are highly compatible (decoherence as an engineering problem; low-frequency noise amenable to DD). Branch 2 is not inconsistent but introduces a potentially fundamental decoherence channel that, if real, would limit what engineering alone can do. The recommended path is: aggressively characterize and suppress conventional noise, then use controlled gravitational-parameter variations to test for any residual, irreducible dephasing predicted by Branch 2."
