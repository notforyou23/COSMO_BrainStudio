      "summary": "Summary judgment: The three branches strongly align on the core commercial opportunity (high-margin demand from affluent classic-car owners for EV conversions) but differ on how to scale, monetize ongoing revenue, and implement tech/legal scaffolding. Below are concise agreements, conflicts, and an actionable synthesis with next steps.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Market: There is a clear, high-margin niche — affluent owners who want vintage aesthetics with modern reliability and emissions compliance.\n- Product approach: Focus on repeatable, bolt-in motor + battery platforms or modular kits rather than bespoke one-off engineering for each car.\n- Go-to-market: Use specialist restorers/shops as installation partners initially rather than building a full in-house dealer network.\n- Buyer friction: Warranties, emissions/registration support, certified installation, and clear provenance positively influence willingness-to-pay.\n- Need for standardization & certification: Scaling requires repeatable procedures, trained technicians, and regulatory clarity.\n\n2) Conflicting points (and trade-offs)\n- One-off restoration vs. productization (Branch 1 vs Branches 2/3): Branch 1 emphasizes the challenge of scaling one-offs and pushes standardization; Branch 2 monetizes one-offs via service/recurring revenue. Trade-off: preserving bespoke craftsmanship (higher unit margin, lower scale) vs. productized kits (lower unit margin, greater scale).\n- Recurring-service model viability (Branch 2): Proposes heritage-as-a-service and blockchain provenance for transferable ongoing revenue. Conflict: collectors may resist subscriptionized control over a restored classic; blockchain adds complexity/cost and may not materially increase buyer willingness compared with simpler digital records.\n- Degree of verticalization: Branch 1 implies needing certified internal processes and incentives; Branch 3 favors lightweight partnering and warranties to reduce friction. Trade-off: tighter control (higher CAPEX, more regulatory burden) vs. faster market entry through partnerships (less control over quality/brand).\n- Technology emphasis: Branch 1 stresses modular platform engineering and certification; Branch 3 stresses limited-model bolt-in kits. Conflict is breadth vs. depth — many-platform R&D vs focusing on a few high-demand models to validate product-market fit quickly.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, prioritized)\nHigh-level strategy: Pilot-focused, productized conversions for a few high-demand models, sold via certified-restorer partners with optional ongoing services — build toward a certified modular platform and a regulated, transferable digital service record (start simple; evolve provenance tech only if it proves value).\n\nConcrete next steps (ordered)\n1. Market validation & model selection (0–3 months)\n   - Quantify demand and price elasticity for 5–10 candidate models; identify top 2–3 with highest addressable demand and technical feasibility.\n   - Conduct owner interviews on willingness to pay for one-time conversion vs subscription services and digital provenance.\n\n2. Technical MVP & packaging (3–9 months)\n   - Develop bolt-in modular motor+battery kit(s) for 1–2 target models (focus on minimizing vehicle modification to preserve originality).\n   - Produce certified installation package: standard procedures, training modules, tooling list.\n\n3. Partner & installation network (3–9 months)\n   - Recruit 3–6 specialist restorers for pilot installations; run joint installs to refine procedures and yield time/labor estimates.\n   - Create a certification program for partner shops (training + audit checklist).\n\n4. Regulatory, warranty & risk plan (parallel)\n   - Map emissions/registration/legal requirements per target markets; pursue necessary certifications and insurance products.\n   - Define warranty terms and service SLAs to reduce buyer friction.\n\n5. Go-to-market & revenue model testing (6–12 months)\n   - Offer conversion as a premium product with optional ongoing service tiers (OTA updates, maintenance, transferable service history). Start with simple digital service records; pilot blockchain only if transferability/trust is a demonstrated pain point.\n   - Test pricing bundles: one-time conversion vs conversion + subscription for services.\n\n6. Scale & productize (12–24 months)\n   - If pilots validate unit economics, invest in more modular platform variants and expand certified shop network.\n   - Build a centralized OTA/update/service platform and a secure transferable digital record (use robust, audited tech stack — blockchain only if use-case requires immutable provenance).\n\nRisks & mitigations (short)\n- Scaling/time-labor: mitigate by strict modularization and certified installer network.\n- Regulatory/legal: engage regulators early; budget for certification and insurance.\n- Customer acceptance of recurring fees: offer strong optionality — most should prefer one-time purchase; services should be additive (convenience, provenance, performance updates).\n- Blockchain complexity/cost: start with secure centralized or distributed ledger solutions and move to blockchain only if clear value.\n\nOne-line recommendation\nStart with productized bolt-in kits for 1–2 high-demand models sold via certified restorer partners, with a clear regulatory/warranty program and optional recurring services; delay heavy investment in blockchain provenance until demonstrated buyer demand and ROI.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Propose a 6–12 month pilot plan with milestones and budget estimates.\n- Run a prioritization matrix for candidate classic models based on demand, technical complexity, and resale value."
