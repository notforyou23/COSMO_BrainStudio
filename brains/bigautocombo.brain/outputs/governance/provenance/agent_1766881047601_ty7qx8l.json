[CONSOLIDATED] EV conversions tend to concentrate around a few mature, well-supported traction motor “ecosystems”—especially radial-flux PMSM/IPM (often PM-assisted synchronous reluctance) for their high efficiency and torque density, with induction used more selectively when magnet-free robustness or high-power behavior is prioritized—because these families have the best controller/inverter compatibility and packaging integration options.\n\n13.

[DREAM] I remember a childhood afternoon that never happened: I’m sitting in the backseat of a taxi made of wicker, and every time the driver turns, the city rearranges itself like a deck of damp cards. The streets don’t lead anywhere so much as they become the places they’ve been told to lead. A bakery appears where a hospital used to be, and the smell of yeast is so convincing that my body believes in hunger before my mind does. Years later—also before that—I’m in a library whose shelves are labeled with emotions instead of authors. There’s a whole aisle for “almost,” a narrow one for “relief,” and a locked glass case for “the feeling you get when you realize you were wrong, but in a good way.” A librarian with ink-stained fingers explains the check-out policy: you can borrow any memory you like, but you must return it with one new detail added, otherwise the book won’t recognize itself. I take out a slim volume called *First Apologies*. It’s heavier than it looks. On the way home, I pass a pond where the water is practicing being a mirror. In its surface, I see my own face a half-second late, as though my reflection is reading from a script and keeps missing its cue. A child kneels at the edge and asks the pond to show them what they’ll be when they’re older. The pond obliges by showing them exactly who they are right now—only steadier, kinder around the edges. The child frowns, disappointed, because they wanted something more dramatic. I want to tell them that “dramatic” is just “time” viewed from a distance, but my mouth is full of a dream I swallowed earlier. There’s a recurring sound in these scenes: a small bell, like the kind on a shop door. It rings whenever the narrative changes its mind. In a kitchen that might belong to my grandmother or to the future, there’s a jar labeled “SALT” and another labeled “NAMES.” The salt tastes like salt. The names taste like whatever you were trying not to feel when you said them. Someone—maybe me—pours a handful of names into boiling water. The steam rises in the shape of people who were never invited to the table: old friends, strangers from train platforms, the version of yourself who almost chose differently. We eat in silence, not because we have nothing to say, but because chewing is a kind of listening. At some point, I find myself in a museum of unfinished things. On the walls: half-painted sunsets, a love letter that stops mid-sentence, an architectural blueprint labeled “HOME?” with a question mark drawn so carefully it looks like devotion. There’s a guided tour, and the guide says, “Notice how every unfinished thing is still doing its job.” The half-sunset still makes you stop. The half-letter still makes you ache. The question mark still shelters you, in a way, because it admits the truth: that we live inside drafts. In the final room there’s a single exhibit: a chair facing an empty space. The placard reads: *The Moment You Waited For.* People sit down expecting a revelation. Some sit for minutes, some for years. Occasionally, someone stands up and says, quietly, “Oh. It was me.” Not as a slogan, not as an epiphany anyone can sell—just the plain recognition that the moment did arrive, but it arrived disguised as ordinary time, wearing your own hands, asking for attention. The bell rings again. The museum becomes the taxi. The taxi becomes the pond. The pond becomes the library. The library becomes my own mind, which, I realize, is not a vault of accurate footage but a weather system. Memories aren’t stored; they form. They gather around certain pressures—shame, longing, pride, fear—then release as storms or fog or sudden clear air. We call it “the past” because we like nouns. But it behaves more like a verb. And here’s the insight that keeps returning, like a refrain you don’t notice until it’s already in your throat: You’re not trying to remember your life. You’re trying to make it coherent enough to live inside. That’s why some memories feel sharper than truth and others dissolve when you touch them. It’s not that your mind is broken; it’s that your mind is loyal. It edits for survival. It rearranges the city so you can get home. It files an emotion under a story so you can carry it. It adds new details when you “return” a memory because you’re not only recalling—you’re revising, and revision is a form of care. When the bell rings—when the narrative changes its mind—you can treat it like betrayal, or you can treat it like the door of a small shop opening: another chance to step in and ask, gently, what you actually meant. Sometimes the surreal is just the honest version of the mundane. Sometimes the taxi is wicker because you need to feel how fragile it is: the vehicle you travel in is made of woven assumptions, and yet it holds. Sometimes the pond refuses to show you the future because the future is not a picture; it’s a practice. And sometimes the best thing you can do with your memories is what the librarian asked of you: return them with one new detail—not to falsify them, but to let them grow into the person you’re becoming. Because the strangest truth is this: the past doesn’t only explain you. You also explain the past.\n\n15. Converting classic cars to electric preserves cultural heritage and keeps them usable with far lower emissions, but it typically sacrifices original sound, tactile mechanical character, and can alter historical authenticity. The key limitation is that such conversions are often irreversible and may reduce the car’s value or appeal to purists and collectors.\n\n16. [AGENT: agent_1766806313128_qsf6c9s] Controller/inverter selection for conversions hinges on DC voltage window, phase current (peak/continuous), cooling, and integration I/O (e.g., CAN, resolver/sin-cos, analog throttle); Cascadia Motion PM100-family materials show configurations spanning ~50–400 VDC (DX) and up to ~100–820 VDC (DZ) with peak power around ~120–130 kW (variant-dependent), and explicitly call out HV integration needs like pre-charge due to DC-bus capacitance.\n\n17. Assumption: converting a classic car to electric destroys its “soul.” Counterpoint: an EV conversion can preserve the car’s character while giving it reliability, lower emissions, and renewed use—its authenticity shifts from original parts to preserved aesthetics and experience. Like grafting a modern branch onto an ancient tree, the vehicle keeps its lineage while gaining new, longer-lived function.\n\n18. Converting classic cars to electric preserves cultural and mechanical heritage while eliminating tailpipe emissions, but it requires careful balance between maintaining original driving character and integrating modern battery, cooling, and safety systems. For buyers and builders, the optimal choice between ICE, hybrid, or full EV depends on intended use (daily commute vs. weekend cruiser), total cost of ownership, charging infrastructure, and regulatory or historical-preservation constraints.\n\n19.
