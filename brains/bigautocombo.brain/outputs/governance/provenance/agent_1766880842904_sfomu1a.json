      "summary": "Summary judgment — high alignment across branches: all three focus on converting ICE vehicles or modernizing vehicles with repeatable, safety-certified technical platforms, and monetizing via service/recurring models while protecting value for owners. Main tensions are around degree of customization vs repeatability, primary customer (heritage owners vs fleets), and near-term revenue model (one-time margin vs subscription/lease).\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Value proposition: Converting legacy vehicles to electric captures high-margin, defensible niches by combining legacy aesthetics/provenance with modern powertrains.\n- Need for repeatability and modularity: Scalable growth requires modular platforms (drivetrain, battery packs, control software) that can be adapted across models to lower cost and shorten timelines.\n- Certification and safety: Regulatory approval, crash/safety validation, and documented build certification are essential to protect buyer confidence and resale value.\n- After-sales & service: A trained service network, warranty, and documented provenance/records are critical to maintaining value and enabling recurring revenue.\n- Validation via pilot: A paid pilot retrofit/conversion is the correct next step to measure costs, timing, customer willingness to pay, and operational learnings.\n\n2) Conflicting points (trade-offs to resolve)\n- Bespoke craftsmanship vs repeatability: Branch 1 (heritage preservation) and Branch 2 (provenance/maintaining original paperwork) push toward bespoke, high-touch work that can harm margins and scalability. Branches 1/3 emphasize modular repeatable systems that favor scale but risk alienating purists.\n- Revenue model: Branch 2 advocates strong recurring revenue (OTA subscriptions, battery leasing) while Branch 1/3 stress high upfront conversion margins. Recurring models improve LTV but require more operations (billing, remote ops, battery swapping/leasing partner).\n- Target market: Branch 2 focuses on classic-car owners willing to accept leases/subscriptions; Branch 3 recommends evaluating other faster paths to profit (fleet electrification, aftermarket modernizations) which have different sales cycles, volume, and certification needs.\n- Certification scope and speed: Pursuing full OEM-level vehicle type-approval is expensive/time-consuming for classics; Branch 1 wants strong certification to preserve resale value, while Branch 3 implies piloting/pay-to-prove may be faster using retrofit certification pathways or component-level approvals.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise roadmap)\nA. Objective: Prove a repeatable, certified, aesthetics-preserving conversion product that supports optional recurring revenue (battery lease/OTA) and a scalable service model.\n\nB. Product strategy (modular + bespoke touch)\n- Core platform: Build a modular EV \"conversion stack\" — standardized motor/controller package, modular battery modules with a defined form-factor, and a replaceable control unit with OTA capability. Design mounts/adapters to be vehicle-specific but use shared core components to preserve economies.\n- Aesthetics/provenance layer: Create a “conservation kit” workflow: reversible mounting, OEM-style wiring harnesses, trunk/underfloor battery packaging where possible, and full documentation to preserve original VIN/records. Offer optional “concours” level restoration for purists as a premium line.\n- Safety/certification: Pursue component-level certification first (battery pack UL/UN38.3, BMS standards, motor safety), plus retrofit certification where available (national retrofit approvals). Develop a conversion validation dossier (structural, thermal, electrical tests) and a standard build signoff checklist for resale/warranty documentation.\n\nC. Business model & go-to-market\n- Pilot product: Run 1–3 paid pilots on high-value classic models (good local demand, parts availability). Offer two packages: (1) Upfront purchase conversion with full warranty; (2) Conversion + battery lease + OTA subscription (lower upfront). Track willingness-to-pay and churn interest.\n- Service network: Train 2–4 local specialist shops as certified installers/servicers. Use a central QA process and remote diagnostics/OTA to maintain standards.\n- Revenue mix: Aim for initial cash by premium conversions; use battery leasing and OTA features to increase ARR for customers open to it. Make subscriptions opt-in and clearly preserve provenance records to avoid resale damage.\n- Fleet/aftermarket parallel experiment: If pilot shows long conversion times or low volume, run a parallel small pilot for fleet retrofit or aftermarket modernizations where throughput and lower customization yield faster profitability.\n\nD. KPIs for pilot (60–120 days)\n- Cost/time: Target COGS and labor baseline per vehicle and conversion lead time.\n- Price elasticity: Conversion package price acceptance and opt-in rate for battery lease/OTA.\n- Safety/validation: Time-to-complete required component approvals and at least one retrofit signoff dossier.\n- Service readiness: Number of certified partner shops, average install error rate, first-time fix rate.\n- Customer outcomes: NPS, willingness to recommend, perceived value vs original.\n\nE. Immediate next steps (first 30 days)\n1. Select 1–2 candidate models for pilot (high local demand, simple packaging).\n2. Define bill-of-materials for modular core + vehicle-specific adapter kit.\n3. Engage a safety/certification consultant to map regulatory pathway and test plan.\n4. Contract a trusted classic-restoration shop as pilot installer and provenance caretaker.\n5. Draft two commercial offers (upfront conversion + optional battery lease/OTA) and pilot customer contract that preserves provenance and resale documentation.\n\nConcise recommendation: Start with a controlled, paid pilot focused on 1–2 classic models using a modular certified core plus vehicle-specific adapter kits; sell both an upfront and a lease/subscription option, train certified installer partners, and prioritize documentation/certification that preserves provenance. Parallelize a small fleet/aftermarket pilot if pilot cycle times or demand signal suggest faster scale. This resolves tension by combining repeatability (shared core) with bespoke finishing (preservation) and optional recurring revenue."
