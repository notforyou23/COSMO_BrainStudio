      "summary": "1) Areas of agreement\n- Core concept: All three branches converge on modularizing the EV powertrain (battery + inverter + motor and control) as an “effective” macroscopic element that can be reused across many classic chassis.\n- Value proposition: Each claims modularization lowers engineering cost, inventory complexity, and lead time while enabling scale, higher margins, and preservation of vehicle identity/aesthetics.\n- Sizing approach: All propose using simplified aggregate vehicle models (mass, drag, rolling resistance) to quickly size motor and battery options for faster quoting and stockable variants.\n- Market positioning overlap: They target classic/enthusiast owners and small shops who want reversible, value-preserving conversions that deliver modern EV performance.\n- Implementation levers: Standardized interfaces, stockable modular packs, and simplified certification/manufacturing are common tactics.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Degree of standardization vs. bespoke integration:\n  - Branch 1 emphasizes trading bespoke integration for standardized interfaces but implies some vehicle-specific adaptation remains.\n  - Branch 2 pushes the strongest claim: a single universal “power‑module” that works across most chassis (homogenization).\n  - Branch 3 accepts modularization but leans toward turnkey, reversible kits and quick sizing rather than pursuing a single plug‑and‑play universal module.\n  Tension: feasibility of a truly universal module vs. pragmatic product families plus vehicle-specific mounts/adapters.\n- Scale and regulatory approach:\n  - Branch 2 implies small shops can scale like OEMs via uniform certification/manufacturing—this downplays regulatory complexity (crash, safety, EMC, homologation) that may still require vehicle-specific work.\n  - Branches 1 and 3 are more pragmatic about reducing engineering and speeding approvals rather than eliminating certification effort.\n- Target customer / business model focus:\n  - Branch 1 is converter-centric (B2B: converters adopt platform).\n  - Branch 2 reads like platform vendor enabling small shops to operate like OEMs (B2B + enabling certification).\n  - Branch 3 is productized turnkey kits (B2C/B2B mix) marketed to end customers and shops.\n  Tension: whether to pursue a platform supplier for converters, an enabling product for shops plus certification services, or direct-to-consumer kits.\n- Reversibility and preservation:\n  - Branch 3 explicitly markets reversibility/value preservation; Branches 1 and 2 emphasize aesthetics and identity but less explicitly guarantee reversibility or ease of restoration to ICE.\n  Tension: tradeoffs between permanence (integrated, optimized installs) and reversible, non‑invasive kits.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, prioritized)\nA. Product strategy (6–12 month roadmap)\n- Adopt a modular product-family approach, not a single one-size-fits-all module. Define:\n  - 2–3 power-module tiers (e.g., City/Performance/Range) with standardized electrical/mechanical interfaces and comms protocols.\n  - A small catalog of chassis-specific mechanical adapter kits (motor mounts, axle adapters, battery trays) to bridge variations.\nRationale: preserves economies of scale while acknowledging unavoidable chassis differences.\n\nB. Interface and standards\n- Lock down a common electrical/mechanical API: mounting points, voltage classes, CAN messages, inverter connectors, cooling and safety interlocks.\n- Publish clear install guides and reversible-mount designs where possible to protect vehicle value.\n\nC. Certification & regulatory path\n- Prioritize modular certification items that can be reused: EMC testing of inverter/control, battery pack safety testing, thermal management validation.\n- For vehicle-level approvals, develop a templated test matrix and partner with an accredited lab to accelerate approvals for converter partners. Recognize some vehicle-specific testing will remain required.\n\nD. Business model & go-to-market\n- Dual channel:\n  - B2B: sell power-module families + adapter kits and provide a certification/enabler package to converters/shops.\n  - B2C/B2B2C: offer pre‑configured turnkey kits for the most popular makes/models (target top 5–10 classics).\n- Pilot: pick 1–2 popular classic platforms to validate adapter kit approach, reversible installs, and real-world cycle testing.\n\nE. Engineering & inventory ops\n- Design for stockability: modular battery packs sized to common ranges, swappable cells, and common inverter hardware scaled by power stage.\n- Build a service/warranty and remanufacturing flow to support lifetime value and reversibility.\n\nF. Validation & metrics\n- Run 3 pilots (different chassis classes) and measure: install time, parts commonality %, engineering hours per platform, time-to-approval, margin per conversion, and owner satisfaction (value preservation).\n- Go/no-go gate after pilot with thresholds for % commonality and cost reduction compared to fully bespoke installs.\n\nQuick prioritized next steps (first 90 days)\n1. Define the interface spec and three module tiers.\n2. Select 2 pilot vehicle platforms and design adapter kits.\n3. Engage one certification lab and one converter/shop partner to scope the templated approval process.\n4. Prototype one power-module and perform bench EMC/thermal/safety tests.\n\nBottom line\nMove forward with a product-family modular approach (Branch 1 + Branch 3) while incorporating Branch 2’s ambition of repeatable certification and shop enablement—but avoid assuming a single universal module. Validate via focused pilots, codify interfaces, and build certification templates to scale safely."
