  "mission": "Collect up-to-date, quantitative market-size and adoption data for automotive electrification and conversion markets (global and by major region), summarize regional regulatory drivers (ZEV mandates, emissions rules, incentives) that materially affect adoption, and map primary customer segments (OEM, fleet, classic/car-conversion owners) with relevant adoption drivers and barriers. Produce a curated bibliography of primary sources (government rules, industry reports, OEM announcements, market data providers) with links and publication dates.",

  "summary": "The research shows that headline “global EV market size” estimates for 2024 vary widely (roughly USD ~396B to ~755B) largely because publishers use different scope definitions (e.g., whether hybrids are included and which vehicle classes are counted). Despite definition noise in revenue sizing, adoption is clearly concentrated by region: in 2023, China, Europe, and the U.S. accounted for ~60%, ~25%, and ~10% of EV sales respectively (IEA), and IEA expects China to remain the dominant volume driver in 2024 with ~10M EV sales and ~45% share of new car sales.\n\nIn parallel, a distinct niche is emerging in classic-car EV conversions, with at least one market-research snapshot placing the global classic-car EV conversion market at ~USD 1.42B in 2024 and attributing large shares to Europe (~USD 520M) and North America (~USD 430M). Regulatory drivers across major regions continue to shape adoption: the EU’s fleet-average CO₂ standards (including the 2025 step and 2035 100% CO₂ reduction target), the U.S. EPA’s MY2027+ multi-pollutant standards, California’s ACC II ZEV requirements starting MY2026 (with 100% by MY2035), and China’s blended approach of purchase tax relief, “dual-credit” rules, and China 6B tailpipe standards.",
  "successAssessment": "Partially met. (1) Market size: EV market-size estimates were captured (with 2024 values and at least one implied forward estimate), and classic-car EV conversion market-size data were captured globally plus Europe/North America for 2024; however, the request also required hybrid conversions and explicit 3–5 year forecast ranges by at least four regions (North America, Europe, China, ROW). The current research lacks (a) hybrid conversion market sizing, (b) consistent regional revenue sizing for EVs (China/ROW splits in revenue terms), and (c) explicit 2028–2030 regional forecast ranges beyond a single CAGR-derived approximation.\n\n(2) Adoption trends: This was mostly met via IEA quantitative regional sales concentration (2023) and 2024 projections (China ~10M and ~45% share; Europe ~3.5M; U.S. >11% share). Additional quantitative trends requested (e.g., YoY growth rates, fleet commitments) were not collected.\n\n(3) Regulatory drivers: Largely met for EU, U.S., California, and China with primary/authoritative sources and effective dates (EU 2019/631 targets and 2025–2027 averaging flexibility; Euro 7 adoption timing; EPA MY2027+ effective date; California ACC II start year and waiver date; China tax incentive timeline; China 6B start date). More regions (e.g., other Asian markets, UK, Canada) were not covered.\n\n(4) Customer segments & bibliography: Not met. The research notes likely drivers for conversion demand (e.g., EU low-emission zones; aftermarket ecosystem), but it does not explicitly map the three customer segments (OEM, fleets, classic/conversion owners) with drivers/barriers, and it does not provide a curated bibliography of 10+ primary sources with publication dates (only several sources were identified, and not consistently with dates).",
