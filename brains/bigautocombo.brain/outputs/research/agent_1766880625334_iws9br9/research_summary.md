# Research Summary

**Agent:** agent_1766880625334_iws9br9
**Mission:** Collect up-to-date, quantitative market-size and adoption data for automotive electrification and conversion markets (global and by major region), summarize regional regulatory drivers (ZEV mandates, emissions rules, incentives) that materially affect adoption, and map primary customer segments (OEM, fleet, classic/car-conversion owners) with relevant adoption drivers and barriers. Produce a curated bibliography of primary sources (government rules, industry reports, OEM announcements, market data providers) with links and publication dates.

## Summary

The research shows that headline “global EV market size” estimates for 2024 vary widely (roughly USD ~396B to ~755B) largely because publishers use different scope definitions (e.g., whether hybrids are included and which vehicle classes are counted). Despite definition noise in revenue sizing, adoption is clearly concentrated by region: in 2023, China, Europe, and the U.S. accounted for ~60%, ~25%, and ~10% of EV sales respectively (IEA), and IEA expects China to remain the dominant volume driver in 2024 with ~10M EV sales and ~45% share of new car sales.

In parallel, a distinct niche is emerging in classic-car EV conversions, with at least one market-research snapshot placing the global classic-car EV conversion market at ~USD 1.42B in 2024 and attributing large shares to Europe (~USD 520M) and North America (~USD 430M). Regulatory drivers across major regions continue to shape adoption: the EU’s fleet-average CO₂ standards (including the 2025 step and 2035 100% CO₂ reduction target), the U.S. EPA’s MY2027+ multi-pollutant standards, California’s ACC II ZEV requirements starting MY2026 (with 100% by MY2035), and China’s blended approach of purchase tax relief, “dual-credit” rules, and China 6B tailpipe standards.

## Key Findings

1. Market sizing dispersion is material: 2024 global “EV market” revenue estimates range from USD 396.4B (MarketsandMarkets; narrower scope) to USD 755B (IMARC; broader scope incl. different category definitions), implying that any planning model must normalize definitions before comparing forecasts (sources: MarketsandMarkets via PRNewswire; IMARC).

2. EV adoption is regionally concentrated: in 2023, China captured ~60% of EV sales, Europe ~25%, and the U.S. ~10% (IEA Global EV Outlook 2024 executive summary).

3. IEA projects China as the main 2024 volume engine: ~10M EV sales with EVs approaching ~45% of China’s new car sales; Europe is around ~3.5M EV sales with slower growth; the U.S. exceeds ~11% of new car sales as EVs (IEA Global EV Outlook 2024, trends in electric cars).

4. Classic-car EV conversion is already a >$1B global niche by at least one estimate: ~USD 1.42B globally in 2024, with Europe ~USD 520M (~36% share) and North America ~USD 430M in 2024 (Growth Market Reports).

5. Regulatory pull is strengthening but differs by region: EU Regulation (EU) 2019/631 sets a -15% fleet-average CO₂ step from 2025 (vs 2021 baseline) and a 100% CO₂ reduction requirement for new cars/vans in 2035; the U.S. EPA finalized MY2027–2032 multi-pollutant standards effective June 17, 2024; California ACC II starts MY2026 (35% rising to 100% by MY2035) with an EPA waiver granted Dec 18, 2024; China extended NEV purchase tax exemptions through 2024–2025 (cap RMB 30,000) and halves them for 2026–2027 (cap RMB 15,000), while China 6B took effect July 1, 2023 (sources: EUR-Lex; EU Council press releases; EPA; CARB; China State Taxation Administration; Trade.gov).
