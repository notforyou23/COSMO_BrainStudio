  "summary": "The research converges on a practical verification toolkit for 2025 that separates (a) fast, claim-level news verification, (b) deeper verification of scientific findings, and (c) retrieval of authoritative primary data/official statistics. For news claims, the most reliable approach is to rely on major fact-checking operations with transparent methods (e.g., Reuters/AP and established nonprofit/newsroom fact-checkers) and to validate conclusions by reading the underlying evidence chain rather than trusting platform labels.\n\nFor scientific and statistical claims, the actionable throughline is “traceability”: verify whether a study was prospectively registered, whether outcomes/analyses match the registration and protocol, and whether data/code artifacts exist to reproduce results. For official statistics, use authoritative catalogs/portals (U.S. and international) that publish methodology, stable identifiers, and machine-readable access (APIs/downloads), and always record the release/vintage for reproducibility.",
  "successAssessment": "Criteria 1 (complete handoff): Met—this synthesis consolidates the three query areas (news fact-checking, scientific verification, and primary statistical sources) into a coherent set of takeaways. Criteria 2 (build upon parent findings): Mostly met—the response integrates the workflows and named resources and adds QA-style flags where confidence is borderline (e.g., claims sourced via Wikipedia or time-specific release assertions). Criteria 3 (actionable results): Met—the findings translate into concrete verification steps (two-source fact-checking, registry-to-paper comparisons, checklist/bias-tool use, and authoritative data portal selection with versioning). Remaining gap: a few time-sensitive or weakly sourced assertions (e.g., “ROBINS-I v2 in 2025,” “TOP 2025,” and some Wikipedia-based entries) should be confirmed against primary/official sources before being treated as definitive.",
