## Summary

In 2024, global EV adoption continued to set records in light-duty vehicles while heavy-duty electrification accelerated from a smaller base. Total global passenger-car + light-duty EV sales (BEV+PHEV) reached ~17.1 million, with China accounting for ~11.0 million (about two-thirds of global electric-car sales) and ~40% YoY growth. Europe (EU+EFTA+UK) was comparatively flat-to-down at ~3.0 million (-3% YoY), while U.S.+Canada reached ~1.8 million (+9% YoY) and the rest of world ~1.3 million (+27% YoY). In heavy-duty, global electric bus sales exceeded 70,000 (+30% YoY) and medium/heavy-duty electric truck sales exceeded 90,000 (+80% YoY), both still highly concentrated in China but showing expansion in Europe and (from a smaller base) the U.S.

Regulatory drivers in 2024 remained a primary determinant of near-term demand shaping and OEM/fleet compliance planning, especially outside China. In the U.S., California’s ACC II sets a binding sales-mix trajectory starting MY2026 (35%) to 100% by 2035, complemented by federal EPA performance standards for MY2027–2032 (light/medium duty) and Heavy-Duty GHG Phase 3 (MY2027+). California’s Advanced Clean Fleets adds buyer-side pull by regulating certain fleet purchases and reporting. In Europe/UK, the EU’s tightening CO₂ standards (including a 0 g CO₂/km target from 2035 for cars/vans) and newly adopted 2024 heavy-duty CO₂ standards (including 100% zero-emission new urban buses by 2035) reinforce a multi-year compliance runway; the UK adds an explicit ZEV mandate with a 22% new-car ZEV share requirement in 2024, rising to 100% by 2035. In China, 2024 policy stability came via continued NEV purchase tax exemptions for 2024–2025 (with reduced benefits 2026–2027) and ongoing dual-credit mechanisms (reported requirements ~28% in 2024 and 38% in 2025), sustaining both demand and supply-side compliance pressure.

EV conversion/retrofit markets show material but method-sensitive market-sizing in 2024. Classic-car conversion service estimates vary widely (~$1.03B vs. ~$3.7B global) due to scope differences (e.g., inclusion of bespoke builds, restoration labor, and components). Component/kit-focused estimates place the EV conversion kit market at roughly ~$1.2B. Fleet retrofit segments show larger, more category-specific estimates (e.g., electric van conversion kits ~$860M; bus electrification retrofit ~$2.71B), with adoption pulled by predictable duty cycles and urban air-quality/ZEV rules but constrained by certification/homologation, liability, and installer capacity.

## Key Findings

1. Light-duty EV sales (2024): Global passenger-car + light-duty BEV+PHEV sales reached ~17.1M; China ~11.0M (~40% YoY; ~two-thirds of global electric-car sales), Europe (EU+EFTA+UK) ~3.0M (-3% YoY), U.S.+Canada ~1.8M (+9% YoY), Rest of World ~1.3M (+27% YoY).

2. Heavy-duty EV adoption (2024): Electric bus sales exceeded 70,000 globally (+30% YoY) and medium/heavy-duty electric truck sales exceeded 90,000 (+80% YoY); >80% of e-trucks were sold in China, Europe sold >10,000 for the second year running, and the U.S. sold >1,700.

3. U.S. regulatory driver (California ACC II): Requires automakers’ new-vehicle sales mix to reach 35% ZEV in MY2026, 68% by 2030, and 100% by 2035; federal EPA standards tighten MY2027–2032 for light/medium duty and begin MY2027 for Heavy-Duty GHG Phase 3.

4. Europe/UK regulatory driver: EU car/van standards step down from 2025 and target 0 g CO₂/km from 2035; EU heavy-duty rules adopted May 2024 include a 100% zero-emission target for new urban buses by 2035 (90% by 2030). The UK mandates 22% ZEV share for new cars in 2024, rising to 28% in 2025 and 100% by 2035.

5. Conversion/retrofit market sizing (2024): Classic-car conversion service market estimates diverge (~$1.03B vs. ~$3.7B global) due to scope definitions; EV conversion kits are estimated at ~~$1.2B; fleet retrofit categories show ~$860M (electric van conversion kits) and ~$2.71B (bus electrification retrofit).
