  "summary": "In 2024, global EV adoption continued to set records in light-duty vehicles while heavy-duty electrification accelerated from a smaller base. Total global passenger-car + light-duty EV sales (BEV+PHEV) reached ~17.1 million, with China accounting for ~11.0 million (about two-thirds of global electric-car sales) and ~40% YoY growth. Europe (EU+EFTA+UK) was comparatively flat-to-down at ~3.0 million (-3% YoY), while U.S.+Canada reached ~1.8 million (+9% YoY) and the rest of world ~1.3 million (+27% YoY). In heavy-duty, global electric bus sales exceeded 70,000 (+30% YoY) and medium/heavy-duty electric truck sales exceeded 90,000 (+80% YoY), both still highly concentrated in China but showing expansion in Europe and (from a smaller base) the U.S.\n\nRegulatory drivers in 2024 remained a primary determinant of near-term demand shaping and OEM/fleet compliance planning, especially outside China. In the U.S., California’s ACC II sets a binding sales-mix trajectory starting MY2026 (35%) to 100% by 2035, complemented by federal EPA performance standards for MY2027–2032 (light/medium duty) and Heavy-Duty GHG Phase 3 (MY2027+). California’s Advanced Clean Fleets adds buyer-side pull by regulating certain fleet purchases and reporting. In Europe/UK, the EU’s tightening CO₂ standards (including a 0 g CO₂/km target from 2035 for cars/vans) and newly adopted 2024 heavy-duty CO₂ standards (including 100% zero-emission new urban buses by 2035) reinforce a multi-year compliance runway; the UK adds an explicit ZEV mandate with a 22% new-car ZEV share requirement in 2024, rising to 100% by 2035. In China, 2024 policy stability came via continued NEV purchase tax exemptions for 2024–2025 (with reduced benefits 2026–2027) and ongoing dual-credit mechanisms (reported requirements ~28% in 2024 and 38% in 2025), sustaining both demand and supply-side compliance pressure.\n\nEV conversion/retrofit markets show material but method-sensitive market-sizing in 2024. Classic-car conversion service estimates vary widely (~$1.03B vs. ~$3.7B global) due to scope differences (e.g., inclusion of bespoke builds, restoration labor, and components). Component/kit-focused estimates place the EV conversion kit market at roughly ~$1.2B. Fleet retrofit segments show larger, more category-specific estimates (e.g., electric van conversion kits ~$860M; bus electrification retrofit ~$2.71B), with adoption pulled by predictable duty cycles and urban air-quality/ZEV rules but constrained by certification/homologation, liability, and installer capacity.",
  "successAssessment": "Partially met. The research provides multiple quantitative market metrics (light-duty EV sales by region; heavy-duty bus/truck sales; several retrofit/conversion market-size estimates) and identifies key regulatory drivers across the U.S., EU/UK, and China with specific program names and timelines. However, the deliverable does not yet include (1) a structured dataset (CSV/JSON table) consolidating metrics by region/segment, (2) an APA-formatted bibliography with URLs, or (3) a full 2–3 page summary note explicitly organizing customer segments (OEM, fleet, classic owners) and implications. The content is sufficient to build those outputs, but the outputs themselves were not produced in the required structured formats.",
