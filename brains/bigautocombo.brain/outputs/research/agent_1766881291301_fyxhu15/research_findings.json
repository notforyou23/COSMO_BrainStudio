  "summary": "Across 2010–2024, there is no single, field-wide meta-analytic “replication rate” for all biomedical research that can be stated defensibly. The most informative evidence comes from (1) targeted replication initiatives in specific areas (notably preclinical cancer biology) and (2) meta-research identifying structural drivers of non-replication. Early, influential reports from industry and prominent commentators (e.g., Bayer’s internal assessments and Begley & Ellis 2012) suggested low reproducibility in parts of preclinical research, but these were not fully transparent, multi-lab replication studies and should be treated as indicative rather than definitive.\n\nThe strongest prospective, structured evidence cited here is the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (RP:CB, eLife, 2021), which found substantial effect-size shrinkage on replication and mixed “success” depending on the criteria used—highlighting that binary replication definitions (p<0.05 vs not) can be misleading. In parallel, the most consistently supported explanatory factors for failed replications are low power/small samples, selective reporting/publication bias, and analytic flexibility (p-hacking). Registered Reports (RRs) are best supported as a process change that reduces selective reporting and shifts the literature toward more null results; however, a generalized “RR replication success rate” across fields remains insufficiently established, and at least one high-profile claim of very high replication under preregistered/high-power practices has been complicated by a 2024 retraction—so conclusions must be cautious and evidence-weighted.\n\nActionable implication: treat replication as domain- and design-dependent; prioritize higher power, preregistration/Registered Reports where feasible, and rigorous transparency (materials/data/code) because practical barriers (incomplete methods, unavailable data/materials) can prevent replication attempts from being executed at all—independently of whether the underlying effect is real.",
  "successAssessment": "1) Completed the handoff: yes—key replication-rate evidence was distilled (preclinical vs clinical vs RR) and major causal mechanisms were synthesized. 2) Built on parent findings: yes—evidence strength was differentiated (prospective replication projects vs influential but less-transparent reports), and domain-specific generalizability limits were made explicit, addressing the borderline-confidence concern. 3) Actionable results: mostly met—clear levers were translated into practical guidance (increase power, reduce analytic flexibility via preregistration/RRs, and enforce data/code/materials availability). Remaining gap: the research base still cannot support a single biomedical-wide replication rate or a robust RR-specific replication success rate; any dashboard-style KPI should therefore be scoped to subfields and to clearly defined replication criteria.",
