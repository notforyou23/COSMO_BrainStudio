  "summary": "For borderline-confidence QA outputs, the dominant best practice is to treat answering as a selective prediction problem: calibrate confidence on held-out data and use thresholds to decide when to answer vs abstain vs escalate (e.g., to retrieval/tooling or a human). This addresses the core issue that raw model probabilities in QA are often miscalibrated; post-hoc calibration (e.g., temperature scaling) and continuous monitoring help ensure the “borderline” band truly corresponds to elevated error risk rather than arbitrary probability ranges.\n\nWhen the goal is to verify (not merely abstain) on borderline cases, recent system patterns converge on an evidence-grounded loop: retrieve → answer → verify → revise. A verification module (often NLI-like support/refute/neutral) checks the proposed answer against retrieved passages, can trigger query rewriting and re-retrieval, and only finalizes answers that pass evidence checks—otherwise refusing or escalating. For external factual claims, verification is strengthened by using fact-checking organizations that publish methodology and evidence trails and adhere to recognized standards (notably IFCN globally and EFCSN in Europe).\n\nOperationally, teams can implement a cost-aware pipeline: require citations/evidence attribution; run automated support/refute checks over top-k passages; and only invoke a second-pass retrieval+regeneration for borderline/failed-verification cases. Calibration and verification can be instrumented with standard metrics and tooling (ECE/reliability diagrams) in CI and periodically re-fit to manage domain drift.",
  "successAssessment": "The synthesis completes the parent-agent handoff by turning the cited research into a concrete verification strategy for borderline-confidence QA: (1) calibrate confidence and use selective prediction thresholds; (2) add an evidence-based verification/retry loop for borderline or failed checks; (3) route high-risk cases to human/tooling; (4) use auditable external fact-checkers for open-world claims. It builds directly on the parent findings (calibration, verification modules, authoritative sources, and tooling) and yields actionable implementation steps (thresholding, support/refute checks over top-k evidence, second-pass retries, CI metrics/plots, and periodic recalibration to counter drift). Overall, criteria are met well; the remaining gap is that no concrete threshold values or benchmark results are provided, which would require dataset- and domain-specific calibration experiments.",
