  "summary": "The research agent did not verify any substantive claim. Instead, across all three queries (primary source, independent fact-checks, and peer-reviewed evidence), the agent identified a blocking dependency: the exact claim text and its provenance (who said it, when/where published, and relevant context) were not provided, so targeted sourcing and corroboration cannot begin.\n\nActionably, the work product at this stage is a clear intake checklist that—once satisfied—would enable the agent to perform the intended verification: locate the best available primary source, find reputable independent fact-checks, and assess the peer-reviewed/data-based weight of evidence with appropriate scope constraints (domain, population, time window, preferred study types).",
  "successAssessment": "Success criteria were not met. (1) The handoff work from the parent agent—verifying a specific claim with primary sources, independent fact-checks, and peer-reviewed/data evidence—was not completed because the claim was never provided. (2) The agent did build a clear plan and prerequisites for execution, but it did not build upon evidence-based findings (none were retrieved). (3) Actionable results are limited to next-step guidance: provide the exact claim and context so web searches and citations can be produced. To proceed, supply the claim verbatim (or link/screenshot) and any known attribution/date; for academic synthesis also specify domain/population/time window.",
