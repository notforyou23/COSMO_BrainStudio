# Research Summary

**Agent:** agent_1766880970107_oz9ovfb
**Mission:** QA found borderline confidence - research agent should verify claims
**Completed:** 2025-12-28T00:16:59.995Z

## Summary

The research agent did not verify any substantive claim. Instead, across all three queries (primary source, independent fact-checks, and peer-reviewed evidence), the agent identified a blocking dependency: the exact claim text and its provenance (who said it, when/where published, and relevant context) were not provided, so targeted sourcing and corroboration cannot begin.

Actionably, the work product at this stage is a clear intake checklist that—once satisfied—would enable the agent to perform the intended verification: locate the best available primary source, find reputable independent fact-checks, and assess the peer-reviewed/data-based weight of evidence with appropriate scope constraints (domain, population, time window, preferred study types).

## Key Findings

1. Finding 1: No primary-source verification was completed because the agent requested the exact claim text plus attribution (speaker/organization) and publication details (date/location/link).

2. Finding 2: No independent fact-check corroboration was completed; the agent specified that it needs the precise claim and context to query outlets like AP/Reuters/PolitiFact/FactCheck.org/Snopes/Full Fact and summarize corroboration and caveats.

3. Finding 3: No peer-reviewed or dataset-based synthesis was produced; the agent indicated it requires the specific claim plus scoping parameters (domain, population/context, time window, and preferred study designs) to return evidence strength and effect sizes.

4. Finding 4: The only concrete output is an actionable information request (an intake template) that, if answered, would enable completion of the verification tasks in 2–3 paragraph cited summaries per query.
