  "summary": "Across ICE, BEV, and PHEV families, the most useful comparison lens is architecture-level classification: what hardware is present (engine, e-machines, clutches/planetary sets, battery size) and how power flows (series/parallel/power-split plus BEV as a primary class). This framing makes engineering implications clearer: BEV powertrains are mechanically simpler than ICE (fewer modules/substructures), while PHEV performance and efficiency depend heavily on architecture choice and energy-management/control strategies under real drive cycles.\n\nBattery chemistry selection (notably NMC/NCA vs LFP) cascades into BMS requirements and thermal-management design because chemistry affects voltage profile, heat generation, usable SOC window, aging, and abuse response. For classic-to-EV conversions, the dominant risks are packaging/structure (battery retention, crash load paths, sealing/ingress, mass distribution) and driveline/controls (instant torque stressing vintage components, regen torque reversals, and integration of braking assist, steering, HVAC, and 12V/DC-DC). Emerging regulatory benchmarks (e.g., FMVSS 305 and the expanded FMVSS 305a with mandatory applicability beginning 9/1/2027 for covered vehicles) are increasingly being treated as engineering reference points even when conversions are not formally certified.",
  "successAssessment": "Partially met. The research supports a strong architecture-level comparison across ICE/BEV/PHEV and identifies key battery/BMS/thermal and conversion-integration risks, including an up-to-date regulatory signal (FMVSS 305a timeline). However, the stated deliverables were not fully produced: there are no architecture diagrams (SVG/PNG), no complete technology matrix with quantitative metrics (efficiency, cost/kg, safety concerns) populated across ICE/BEV/PHEV/conversion approaches, and no explicitly prioritized risk register for conversions. Next steps to fully meet criteria would be to (1) draft standardized block diagrams for each architecture, (2) build a metric matrix with sourced ranges/assumptions, and (3) turn the conversion risks into a ranked FMEA-style list (severity/likelihood/detectability) aligned to FMVSS 305/305a-inspired benchmarks.",
