  "summary": "When a scientific claim feels plausible but remains borderline-confidence, best practice is to shift from evaluating a single study to evaluating the broader body of evidence. This means prioritizing systematic reviews/meta-analyses (or a lightweight “mini-synthesis”), looking for independent replications, and assessing whether results converge across different teams and methods. High-stakes decisions should not rest on one new or flashy finding; confidence should increase mainly when effect sizes and conclusions remain consistent across multiple, transparent studies.\n\nOperationally, structured certainty frameworks (notably GRADE) provide a repeatable way to judge how sure we should be by checking common failure modes: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. On the tooling side, automated scholarly claim-checking works best as decision support grounded in retrieved evidence (quoted passages + context), not as standalone “true/false” automation. Tools like scite can rapidly surface whether later literature supports or contradicts a claim by classifying citation contexts, while research benchmarks like SciFact illustrate the evidence-retrieval + entailment pipeline that remains the most reliable pattern.\n\nFinally, 2020–2025 meta-research reinforces that reproducibility concerns persist and that many interventions are evaluated via proxies (e.g., data sharing) rather than measured improvements in replication success. Evidence suggests incentives such as badges may not reliably change behavior (e.g., limited effects on data sharing), underscoring the need to measure real reproducibility outcomes and to design workflows that reduce researcher degrees of freedom (preregistration/Registered Reports, data/code sharing, and rigorous replication).",
  "successAssessment": "Criteria 1 (complete work handed off): Met—produced a focused synthesis oriented to verifying borderline-confidence scientific claims, reflecting the handoff that verification was needed. Criteria 2 (build upon parent findings): Met—integrated the parent agent’s three query streams (best-practice evaluation of evidence, automated scholarly fact-checking approaches/tools, and 2020–2025 reproducibility/verification literature) into a coherent verification playbook. Criteria 3 (actionable results): Mostly met—outputs translate into concrete actions (seek meta-analyses/replications, apply GRADE domains, prioritize preregistration/transparency, use scite/SciFact-style evidence-grounded checks, and demand measured reproducibility outcomes). If additional actionability is needed, the next step would be to convert these into a step-by-step checklist/workflow template for a specific domain (e.g., biomedicine vs. social science) and define decision thresholds for “how much to update” given replication and certainty ratings.",
