You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a runnable notebook + CSV template in /outputs with (a) default assumptions by segment (fleet, classic, specialty), (b) sensitivity toggles (energy price, utilization, battery replacement, financing), and (c) preloaded standard drive-cycle proxies (urban/last-mile, mixed, highway) so users can compare ICE vs conversion vs BEV.
Project: generated_configuration_1766882461411 (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/template_user_inputs.csv
- Purpose: CSV template for user-editable inputs (vehicle specs, segment selection, scenario toggles, cycle choice, and key financial/operational parameters) that the notebook can ingest directly.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- notebooks/ice_vs_conversion_vs_bev.ipynb: Runnable Jupyter notebook that loads the CSV template, applies default segment assumptions and sensitivity toggles, runs drive-cycle proxies, and compares ICE vs conversion vs BEV TCO/energy outcomes with plots and tables.
- src/evconv_config/assumptions.py: Defines default assumptions by segment (fleet, classic, specialty) and validated schema for merging user overrides with defaults.
- src/evconv_config/drive_cycles.py: Provides preloaded standard drive-cycle proxies (urban/last-mile, mixed, highway) as time-speed profiles plus helper functions to select and resample cycles.
- src/evconv_config/model.py: Implements simplified comparative models for ICE vs conversion vs BEV including energy use, battery replacement, financing, and utilization impacts using the configured assumptions and cycles.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: CSV template for user-editable inputs (vehicle specs, segment selection, scenario toggles, cycle choice, and key financial/operational parameters) that the notebook can ingest directly.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/template_user_inputs.csv')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/template_user_inputs.csv')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/template_user_inputs.csv.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
