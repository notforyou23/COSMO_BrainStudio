Mission summary: Refactor and modularize reusable code artifacts: 2025-12-28T00-10-33-623Z_src_customer_discovery_outputs_py_stage1_attempt1_prompt.txt, 2025-12-28T00-10-33-623Z_src_customer_discovery_outputs_py_stage1_attempt2_prompt.txt, 2025-12-28T00-10-33-623Z_plan_attempt1_prompt.txt, customer_discovery_outputs.py, 2025-12-28T00-10-34-375Z_plan_attempt1_prompt.txt
Project: generated_script_1766880834212 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/customer_discovery/outputs.py
- Purpose: Refactored, modular implementation of customer discovery output generation (replacing the monolithic logic) with clear public APIs and reusable helpers.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/customer_discovery/prompt_artifacts.py: Utilities to load, normalize, and manage the historical prompt artifacts (the timestamped *_prompt.txt files) in a reusable, testable way.
- src/customer_discovery/rendering.py: Shared rendering/formatting helpers (e.g., deterministic section building, safe markdown/text composition) used by outputs and prompt artifact handling.
- src/customer_discovery/__init__.py: Package initializer exporting the stable public functions/classes for customer discovery output generation after refactor.
- customer_discovery_outputs.py: Backward-compatible shim that preserves the existing import/CLI surface while delegating implementation to src/customer_discovery/outputs.py.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Refactored, modular implementation of customer discovery output generation (replacing the monolithic logic) with clear public APIs and reusable helpers.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/customer_discovery/outputs.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/customer_discovery/outputs.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/customer_discovery/outputs.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
