You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Produce a v1 compliance/certification pathway artifact in /outputs: /outputs/compliance_standards_map.md plus a structured table mapping conversion components to applicable standards (FMVSS/UNECE where relevant), required tests (EMC, HV safety, braking, lighting, labeling), documentation package checklist, and an initial certification strategy decision tree.
Project: generated_library_1766880625858 (python library)

Target file details:
- Path: src/compliance_pathway/generate.py
- Purpose: Implements the end-to-end generator that assembles data, validates it, and writes /outputs/compliance_standards_map.md deterministically.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/compliance_pathway/__init__.py: Package initializer exporting the public API for generating compliance/certification pathway artifacts.
- src/compliance_pathway/model.py: Defines dataclasses and schemas for standards, components, tests, documentation checklist items, and certification strategy decision nodes.
- src/compliance_pathway/data.py: Contains curated v1 mappings for FMVSS/UNECE standards, required tests, documentation package checklist, and component-to-standard crosswalk data.
- src/compliance_pathway/render.py: Renders the compliance standards map, structured mapping table, checklist, and decision tree into a single markdown artifact.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Implements the end-to-end generator that assembles data, validates it, and writes /outputs/compliance_standards_map.md deterministically.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/compliance_pathway/generate.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/compliance_pathway/generate.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/compliance_pathway/generate.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
