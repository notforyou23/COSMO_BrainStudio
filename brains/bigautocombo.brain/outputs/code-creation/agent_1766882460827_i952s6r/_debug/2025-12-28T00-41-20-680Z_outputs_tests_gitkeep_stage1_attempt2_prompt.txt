You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create /outputs/README.md indexing all deliverables, plus a minimal directory scaffold (e.g., /outputs/models, /outputs/compliance, /outputs/ops, /outputs/sim, /outputs/tests) and placeholders with acceptance criteria for goal_1 (simulation results pack) and goal_2 (test matrix + design rules).
Project: /outputs/README.md indexing all deliverables, plus a minimal directory scaffold (e.g., /outputs/models, /outputs/compliance, /outputs/ops, /outputs/sim, /outputs/tests) and placeholders with acceptance criteria for goal_1 (simulation results pack) and goal_2 (test matrix + design rules). (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/tests/.gitkeep
- Purpose: Ensures the /outputs/tests directory exists for test plans, matrices, and test evidence.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/init_outputs_scaffold.py: Creates the /outputs directory scaffold with required subfolders and generates /outputs/README.md plus placeholder templates with acceptance criteria for goal_1 and goal_2.
- outputs/README.md: Indexes all deliverables under /outputs and documents where to find simulation, compliance, ops, models, and tests artifacts along with pointers to goal_1 and goal_2 placeholders.
- outputs/.gitkeep: Ensures the /outputs directory is tracked in version control even when empty.
- outputs/models/.gitkeep: Ensures the /outputs/models directory exists for model-related deliverables.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Ensures the /outputs/tests directory exists for test plans, matrices, and test evidence.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/tests/.gitkeep')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/tests/.gitkeep')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/tests/.gitkeep.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
