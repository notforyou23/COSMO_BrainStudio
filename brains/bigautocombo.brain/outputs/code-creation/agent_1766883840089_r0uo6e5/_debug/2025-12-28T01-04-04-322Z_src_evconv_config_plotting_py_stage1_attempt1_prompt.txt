Mission summary: Refactor and modularize reusable code artifacts: 2025-12-28T00-55-50-580Z_src_evconv_config_io_py_stage1_attempt2_prompt.txt, 2025-12-28T00-55-50-580Z_src_evconv_config_plotting_py_stage1_attempt1_prompt.txt, 2025-12-28T00-55-50-580Z_src_evconv_config_plotting_py_stage1_attempt2_prompt.txt, 2025-12-28T00-55-50-580Z_src_evconv_config_workflow_py_stage1_attempt1_prompt.txt
Project: generated_configuration_1766883840323 (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: src/evconv/config/plotting.py
- Purpose: Provides a reusable, convention-driven plotting configuration layer (themes, rcParams, figure sizing, colormaps) and helpers to apply/serialize plotting settings.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/evconv/config/__init__.py: Package entrypoint that exposes the public configuration API and provides versioned, stable imports for IO, plotting, and workflow config utilities.
- src/evconv/config/types.py: Defines typed, validated dataclasses (and shared enums/constants) for configuration objects used across IO, plotting, and workflow modules.
- src/evconv/config/io.py: Implements complete configuration loading/saving/merging utilities (YAML/JSON), schema-like validation hooks, and path resolution for the refactored system.
- src/evconv/config/workflow.py: Defines the modular workflow configuration model (architectures, stages, parameters, presets) and utilities to assemble and validate end-to-end runs.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provides a reusable, convention-driven plotting configuration layer (themes, rcParams, figure sizing, colormaps) and helpers to apply/serialize plotting settings.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/evconv/config/plotting.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/evconv/config/plotting.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/evconv/config/plotting.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
