# Example override file for the competitive landscape generator.
# Copy this file to: data/competitive_landscape/overrides.yaml
# Then re-run the generator; your overrides will be merged on top of the seed dataset.
#
# Supported capabilities:
# - Add new competitors (append to competitors_add)
# - Edit existing competitors (by key) (competitors_edit)
# - Hide competitors (competitors_hide)
# - Adjust pricing bands (pricing_bands + band_aliases)
# - Annotate compliance posture & differentiation (notes, compliance, differentiation)
