You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a competitive landscape matrix deliverable in /outputs: /outputs/competitive_map.xlsx (or .csv) + /outputs/competitive_summary.md covering kit suppliers, integrators, OEM programs, pricing bands, warranty terms, compliance posture, and differentiation opportunities.
Project: competitive landscape matrix deliverable in /outputs: /outputs/competitive_map.xlsx (or .csv) + /outputs/competitive_summary.md covering kit suppliers, integrators, OEM (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/competitive_landscape/schemas.py
- Purpose: Dataclass and validation helpers defining the competitive record schema and safe defaults for missing/unknown attributes.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/generate_competitive_map.py: Standalone CLI script that builds /outputs/competitive_map.xlsx (or .csv fallback) and /outputs/competitive_summary.md from a curated dataset plus optional user overrides.
- src/competitive_landscape/builder.py: Core library module that loads competitor records, normalizes fields (supplier type, pricing bands, warranty, compliance), scores differentiation opportunities, and writes the matrix and markdown summary.
- data/competitive_landscape/competitors_seed.csv: Seed dataset of kit suppliers, integrators, and OEM programs with columns for pricing, warranty, compliance posture, and notes used to generate the initial competitive matrix.
- data/competitive_landscape/overrides.example.yaml: Example user override file showing how to add/edit competitors, adjust pricing bands, and annotate compliance and differentiation notes without changing code.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Dataclass and validation helpers defining the competitive record schema and safe defaults for missing/unknown attributes.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/competitive_landscape/schemas.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/competitive_landscape/schemas.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/competitive_landscape/schemas.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
