## Cognitive Work Analysis

1) Quality Assessment (1–10)
- Depth: 8 — detailed reasoning and examples provided
- Novelty: 7 — balanced mix of familiar and new territory
- Coherence: 5 — moderate thematic coherence

2) Dominant Themes
- more data: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)
- emergent: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)
- complex system: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)

3) Intellectual Progress
Consistent depth maintained across the period, though limited explicit cross-referencing between ideas.

4) Gaps & Blind Spots
No major blind spots detected. Exploration appears well-distributed across multiple conceptual areas.

5) Standout Insights (breakthrough potential)
- 46: analyst — Probability/statistics: analyses that assume n points are i.i.d. uniform (e.g., on a unit square) are often dominated by asymptotic expectations (law of large numbers, CLT) and thus gloss over finite-...
- 20: critic — Assumption: continuity of a function implies it is well-behaved (differentiable) for calculus and modelling. This is false—there exist continuous functions (e.g., the Weierstrass function) that are no...
- 43: analyst — In probability, the law of large numbers guarantees sample averages converge to the expected value, but the convergence speed is governed by variance—by the central limit theorem the sample mean is ap...
- 44: critic — Assumption: Mathematics is purely objective and independent — partially true: while proofs follow objective logic given axioms, the choice of axioms, definitions, and which structures we study is a hu...
- 45: curiosity — Question: Let a, b, c be independent standard normal random variables and f(x)=ax^2+bx+c. What is the probability that f has two real roots (i.e., that the discriminant Δ = b^2 − 4ac ≥ 0)? Express the...

## Goal Portfolio Evaluation

## 1) Top 5 Priority Goals (immediate focus)
1. **goal_83** — fix the known syntax error so *something runnable* exists.
2. **goal_72** — run end-to-end and capture evidence (run.log + artifacts + STATUS/index updates).
3. **goal_69** — create **coverage_matrix.csv** + **eval_loop.md** (gap-tracking + decision rules).
4. **goal_62** — ship **roadmap_v1.md** (scope, “comprehensive v1”, DoD, 20-cycle plan).
5. **goal_90** — ship **bibliography_system.md** + seed **references.bib** (10–20 entries, tagged).

## 2) Goals to Merge (redundant clusters)
- **Roadmap_v1 cluster (merge into one):** goal_13, goal_25, goal_26, goal_28, goal_36, goal_37, goal_39, goal_45, goal_53, goal_62, goal_91  
- **Bibliography cluster (merge into one):** goal_9, goal_14, goal_20, goal_29, goal_46, goal_87, goal_90  
- **Coverage matrix + eval loop cluster (merge into one):** goal_10, goal_15, goal_21, goal_24, goal_27, goal_30, goal_41, goal_47, goal_69  
- **Runnable experiment / compute skeleton cluster (merge into one):** goal_6, goal_7, goal_33, goal_42, goal_49, goal_64, goal_65, goal_66, goal_67, goal_89, goal_111, goal_112, goal_114  
- **Fix toy experiment syntax error cluster (merge into one):** goal_57, goal_68, goal_83  
- **Execution evidence / logs / tests cluster (merge into one):** goal_32, goal_55, goal_63, goal_70, goal_71, goal_72, goal_86, goal_115, goal_116  
- **Outputs indexing/manifest consolidation cluster (merge into one):** goal_58, goal_84

## 3) Goals to Archive (low-value / premature / fragments)
Archive: goal_73, goal_74, goal_75, goal_76, goal_78, goal_79, goal_80, goal_81, goal_82, goal_95, goal_97, goal_98, goal_99, goal_100, goal_101, goal_102, goal_103, goal_104, goal_105, goal_106, goal_107, goal_108, goal_109, goal_110, goal_117, goal_118, goal_119, goal_120, goal_121, goal_122, goal_123

(Also: none violate the “>10 pursuits with <30% progress” mandate based on the counts shown.)

## 4) Missing Directions (not well-represented)
- **One canonical “ontology” for domains/subtopics/tags** shared by roadmap ↔ coverage matrix ↔ BibTeX tags (right now it’s implied but not enforced).
- **Closure rules**: explicit “done/closed” state for completed goals + a cleanup pass to remove duplicates after merging.
- **CI/reproducibility plumbing**: a minimal CI workflow (or at least documented local invariant checks) beyond ad-hoc logs.
- **Survey-writing pipeline**: section-outline → source notes → synthesized section drafts with citation integration (beyond templates).

## 5) Pursuit Strategy (how to approach top goals)
- **Single “shipping spine”** for the next cycle: fix/run/prove artifacts first (**goal_83 → goal_72**), so every subsequent planning doc can link to real outputs.
- **Then lock steering artifacts**: create roadmap + matrix + eval rules (**goal_62 + goal_69**) using one shared tag/ontology.
- **Then seed bibliography** aligned to the matrix (**goal_90**), so “read next” becomes mechanically driven by matrix gaps.

### Prioritized Goals

- **goal_6**: Create a minimal runnable computational skeleton in /outputs (or project root): a Python script/notebook + requirements (or pyproject) + one toy experiment demonstrating a key survey concept, since the deliverables audit shows only 3 markdown files (README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md) and 0 execution results.
- **goal_7**: Execute the created computational skeleton end-to-end and persist execution outputs (logs/plots/results) into /outputs, because the deliverables audit reports 0 test/execution results.
- **goal_8**: Create /outputs/roadmap_scope_success_criteria.md defining 'comprehensive survey v1' (scope boundaries, subtopic list, prioritization policy, and Definition of Done), since there are currently no dedicated planning documents in the audit.
- **goal_9**: Create /outputs/references.bib with an initial seed set + documented bib workflow (fields required, tagging, deduplication), because no bibliography artifact exists in the current deliverables set (only README.md/first_artifact.md/research_template.md).
- **goal_10**: Create /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or .md table) mapping subdomains -> core sources -> status (unread/skim/read/notes/verified) and define the 'read next' decision rule, since no analysis outputs or matrix artifacts exist yet.

---

#### Agent 2: AnalysisAgent

- **Goal:** Formalize and derive rigorous mathematical statements for the prioritized problems: produce precise problem statements, hypothesize theorems/lemmas, produce step-by-step symbolic derivations or proofs (or identify gaps), and produce worked examples demonstrating techniques. Where symbolic computation helps, reduce complexity using CAS.
- **Status:** completed
- **Results:** 9 insights, 1 findings
- **Duration:** 86.6s

**Sample Insights:**
1. Well-posedness should be stated as a property of the parameter-to-solution map \mu\mapsto u(\mu), not just pointwise existence/uniqueness; continuity/differentiability/analyticity are central because they enable continuation, optimization gradients, and reduced-order surrogates....
2. Uniform-in-\mu a priori inequalities (coercivity, monotonicity, inf-sup, dissipativity, compactness) are the structural backbone: if they persist, stability and numerics are robust; if they degrade, one should expect boundary layers, stiffness, loss of regularity, nonuniqueness, and bifurcation-like...
3. The same energy/monotonicity estimate can simultaneously power existence proofs, stability/uniqueness arguments, and discretization error bounds—linking functional analysis directly to solver design and certified computation....

**Sample Findings:**
1. Across the analytical, practical, and historical perspectives, the unifying move is to treat a parametrized model not as many separate problems but as a single operator equation on a product space: find u(\mu) such that F(u,\mu)=0 between appropriate...

## Strategic Decisions

## 1) TOP 5 GOALS TO PRIORITIZE (by goal ID)

1) **goal_83 — Fix known syntax error(s) so something runnable exists**
- Rationale: Multiple agents reported syntax errors in core entrypoints/modules (e.g., `scripts/run_pipeline.py`, `src/goal_33_toy_experiment.py`, `src/plotting.py`, `src/renderers.py`, `src/deterministic_runner/plotting.py`). Until this is resolved, all downstream “run evidence”, tests, and research artifacts remain fragile or non-reviewable.

2) **goal_72 — Execute end-to-end and capture evidence (run.log + artifacts + status updates)**
- Rationale: Execution evidence is the backbone of credibility and review. Several execution attempts noted environment/path constraints; we need one canonical “this works” run that produces deterministic artifacts and logs in the repo’s canonical location.

3) **goal_58 / goal_84 (Outputs indexing/manifest consolidation cluster) — Make `/outputs/` canonical and discoverable**
- Rationale: The audit still shows **Documents: 0** because many `.md` artifacts live under **agent-specific paths** (e.g., `.../code-creation/agent_.../outputs/...`) rather than the repo’s `./outputs/`. This is a discoverability and governance failure even if content exists.

4) **goal_69 — Ship coverage matrix + eval loop rules (gap-tracking + decision policy)**
- Rationale: This is the steering mechanism. Without a single shared matrix + decision rules, cycles will keep generating artifacts that don’t converge (or can’t be audited against “what’s missing”).

5) **goal_62 — Ship roadmap_v1 (scope, DoD, 20-cycle plan) + align it to matrix + bibliography tags**
- Rationale: The roadmap is the contract for what “comprehensive v1” means; it should anchor the survey-writing pipeline, the matrix, and the bibliography taxonomy so the system doesn’t drift.

(Closely following: **goal_90** bibliography system + `references.bib`, but it should be aligned after matrix/ontology is locked.)

---

## 2) KEY INSIGHTS (most important observations)

1) **Audit mismatch is the primary operational risk**
- The audit shows **125 files created** but **Documents: 0** because artifacts are not in the repo’s canonical `./outputs/`. This blocks review and makes progress appear nonexistent even when work exists.

2) **Runnability is currently unstable due to scattered syntax errors**
- Multiple “almost-complete” implementations exist, but several contain syntax errors, preventing a single clean end-to-end run and undermining test evidence.

3) **Environment constraint: absolute `/outputs` may be unwritable**
- Several execution agents reported “permission denied” for `/outputs`, writing instead to `/mnt/data/outputs` and using symlinks. The repo should standardize on **relative `./outputs/`** to avoid environment-specific failures.

4) **There is duplicated effort across many overlapping goals**
- Multiple agents created similar scaffolding (pipeline scripts, README, tests). Consolidation into one canonical implementation is now higher value than creating new variants.

5) **Governance artifacts (roadmap/matrix/bib taxonomy) must share one ontology**
- The system needs a single tag/ontology that links: roadmap sections ↔ coverage matrix rows ↔ BibTeX tags. Otherwise, bibliography growth won’t close coverage gaps.

---

## 3) STRATEGIC DIRECTIVES (high-level directions for the next 20 cycles)

1) **Consolidate to one canonical pipeline + one canonical outputs directory**
- Enforce: one entrypoint (`scripts/run_pipeline.py`), one test runner, one `./outputs/` folder, one `./outputs/index.md` manifest.
- Success condition: a fresh clone can run `python scripts/run_pipeline.py` and populate `./outputs/` deterministically.

2) **Stop generating new scaffolds; instead merge, delete, and stabilize**
- For the next cycles, treat new “parallel skeletons” as regressions.
- Consolidate best-of-breed components from existing agent outputs; remove duplicates; make tests enforce the invariants.

3) **Lock the steering system: coverage matrix + eval loop + roadmap (shared ontology)**
- Define: domain taxonomy, coverage statuses, “definition of done”, and the rule for what the next cycle must produce based on matrix gaps.
- Every cycle must update at least: `./outputs/index.md` + one matrix row’s status.

4) **Make evidence non-optional: always ship run logs + test logs**
- Each cycle produces:
  - `./outputs/run.log`
  - `./outputs/test.log`
  - `./outputs/run_stamp.json` (env + git hash + seed + command)
- Tests verify these exist and have required keys.

5) **Transition from infrastructure to survey-writing pipeline**
- After stabilization: implement the content pipeline:
  - outline → source notes (with citations) → synthesized section drafts → integration into “comprehensive v1”.
- The coverage matrix drives what section gets written next; bibliography ingestion is tied to missing/weak matrix cells.

## 4) URGENT GOALS TO CREATE (deliverables-based gaps)
The audit still reports **Documents: 0** and shows recent `.md` files under **agent-specific paths** (e.g., `.../code-creation/agent_.../outputs/README.md`). Also multiple core scripts were flagged with **syntax_error**. These are high-severity gaps that block reviewability and execution.

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Promote/relocate existing markdown artifacts from agent-specific paths (e.g., .../code-creation/agent_.../outputs/README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md) into the repo’s canonical ./outputs/ directory, and add ./outputs/index.md that links to every artifact so the deliverables audit no longer shows Documents: 0.",
    "agentType": "document_creation",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Deliverables audit shows Documents: 0 despite multiple .md artifacts existing under agent-specific directories; this blocks discoverability and review."
  },
  {
    "description": "Fix the reported syntax errors in core runnable files (including scripts/run_pipeline.py and any flagged modules such as src/goal_33_toy_experiment.py, src/plotting.py, src/renderers.py, src/deterministic_runner/plotting.py), then run the pipeline end-to-end to generate deterministic artifacts in ./outputs/ with saved ./outputs/run.log and ./outputs/test.log.",
    "agentType": "code_creation",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Multiple agents reported syntax_error failures in key pipeline/plotting files, preventing a stable end-to-end run and undermining execution evidence."
  },
  {
    "description": "Standardize outputs path handling to avoid unwritable absolute /outputs: ensure all code writes to relative ./outputs/ (creating it if missing) and update documentation/tests accordingly; remove reliance on environment-specific /mnt/data/outputs symlink workarounds.",
    "agentType": "code_creation",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Execution agents reported PermissionError for /outputs and redirected to /mnt/data/outputs; without standardization, reproducibility and portability remain broken."
  },
  {
    "description": "Add/verify smoke tests that assert required artifacts exist in ./outputs/ (run_stamp.json, run.log, test.log, index.md) and capture a passing test run log into ./outputs/test_run.log so validation is reviewable.",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.9,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Test/execution results exist but are not consistently canonicalized; we need a single passing, reviewable validation artifact in ./outputs/."
  }
]
```

If you want, I can also compress this into a 1-page “Cycle 1–20 execution plan” (phase-by-phase) that maps each directive to concrete artifacts and acceptance criteria—without adding new conceptual overhead.

### Key Insights

1. The audit shows **125 files created** but **Documents: 0** because artifacts are not in the repo’s canonical `./outputs/`. This blocks review and makes progress appear nonexistent even when work exists.

### Strategic Directives

1. Enforce: one entrypoint (`scripts/run_pipeline.py`), one test runner, one `./outputs/` folder, one `./outputs/index.md` manifest.
2. Success condition: a fresh clone can run `python scripts/run_pipeline.py` and populate `./outputs/` deterministically.
3. For the next cycles, treat new “parallel skeletons” as regressions.
4. Consolidate best-of-breed components from existing agent outputs; remove duplicates; make tests enforce the invariants.
