## Cognitive Work Analysis

1) Quality Assessment (1–10)
- Depth: 8 — detailed reasoning and examples provided
- Novelty: 7 — balanced mix of familiar and new territory
- Coherence: 5 — moderate thematic coherence

2) Dominant Themes
- more data: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)
- emergent: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)
- complex system: 1 mentions (5% of thoughts)

3) Intellectual Progress
Consistent depth maintained across the period, though limited explicit cross-referencing between ideas.

4) Gaps & Blind Spots
No major blind spots detected. Exploration appears well-distributed across multiple conceptual areas.

5) Standout Insights (breakthrough potential)
- 46: analyst — Probability/statistics: analyses that assume n points are i.i.d. uniform (e.g., on a unit square) are often dominated by asymptotic expectations (law of large numbers, CLT) and thus gloss over finite-...
- 83: critic — Mathematics is not purely objective and independent because its theorems rest on chosen axioms, definitions, and formal systems—different choices produce different "truths" (e.g., Euclidean vs. non‑Eu...
- 20: critic — Assumption: continuity of a function implies it is well-behaved (differentiable) for calculus and modelling. This is false—there exist continuous functions (e.g., the Weierstrass function) that are no...
- 44: critic — Assumption: Mathematics is purely objective and independent — partially true: while proofs follow objective logic given axioms, the choice of axioms, definitions, and which structures we study is a hu...
- 45: curiosity — Question: Let a, b, c be independent standard normal random variables and f(x)=ax^2+bx+c. What is the probability that f has two real roots (i.e., that the discriminant Δ = b^2 − 4ac ≥ 0)? Express the...

## Goal Portfolio Evaluation

## 1) Top 5 Priority Goals (focus now)
1. **goal_83** — fix the known syntax error blocking the toy experiment from running.
2. **goal_89** — ship a minimal runnable script + dependency spec + one command to run end-to-end.
3. **goal_71** — add pytest that asserts the pipeline creates expected artifacts + basic schema checks.
4. **goal_72** — execute the pipeline once and persist evidence (`run.log`, artifacts) + update `STATUS.md`/`index.md`.
5. **goal_39** — create `outputs/roadmap_v1.md` with scope + “comprehensive v1” DoD + 20-cycle plan (so reading/experiments don’t drift).

## 2) Goals to Merge (overlap/redundancy clusters)
**Roadmap / scope / DoD (merge to one):** goal_13, goal_28, goal_39, goal_45, goal_53, goal_62, goal_91, goal_25, goal_26, goal_36, goal_37, goal_8, goal_128  
**Bibliography system + seeded bib (merge to one):** goal_9, goal_14, goal_20, goal_29, goal_46, goal_87, goal_90  
**Coverage matrix + eval loop (merge to one):** goal_10, goal_15, goal_21, goal_27, goal_30, goal_41, goal_47, goal_69, goal_24, goal_23, goal_92  
**Runnable skeleton + determinism + artifacts schema (merge to one):** goal_6, goal_7, goal_32, goal_33, goal_42, goal_49, goal_55, goal_57, goal_64, goal_65, goal_66, goal_67, goal_68, goal_85, goal_111, goal_112, goal_113, goal_114, goal_115, goal_116, goal_125, goal_126, goal_127, goal_129, goal_130  
**Evidence pack / index / run metadata (merge to one):** goal_58, goal_63, goal_70, goal_72, goal_86

## 3) Goals to Archive (explicit IDs)
No goals meet the “pursued >10x with <30% progress” mandate.

Archive (off-scope / non-actionable fragments / creative writing not aligned to deliverables):
- **goal_73, goal_74, goal_75, goal_76**
- **goal_78, goal_79, goal_80, goal_81, goal_82**
- **goal_100, goal_101, goal_102, goal_103, goal_104, goal_117, goal_118, goal_119, goal_120, goal_121**
- **goal_105, goal_106, goal_107, goal_108, goal_109, goal_110, goal_122, goal_123**
- **goal_98** (likely premature/off-track vs the current “make it runnable + survey artifacts” bottleneck)

Rotate (not archive) due to concentration risk:
- **goal_13** (high pursuits relative to others; deprioritize until runnable+evidence exists)

## 4) Missing Directions (important gaps)
- A **single “north star” topic definition** for what the survey is actually about (1 paragraph) and the target subfields it must cover (beyond generic “comprehensive”).
- **Source-note production pipeline**: where notes live, naming, and a minimum viable “1 good note” example wired into coverage matrix + bib entry.
- **Acceptance tests for planning artifacts** (roadmap/matrix/bib): e.g., “matrix has ≥N rows; bib parses; roadmap has DoD checklist.”
- **Final report build plan** (LaTeX/Quarto/Markdown→PDF) and citation integration plan—needed to reach the “polished technical report” goal later.

## 5) Pursuit Strategy (how to execute the top goals)
- **Order of operations (fast unblocking):** goal_83 → goal_89 → goal_71 → goal_72 → goal_39.
- **Keep it minimal + deterministic:** one entrypoint, fixed seed, fixed output paths (`./outputs`), fixed schemas.
- **Ship-per-cycle rule (operationally):** every cycle must end with new/updated files in `./outputs/` (logs/results/index/status).
- **After runnable evidence exists:** merge and close the redundant roadmap/matrix/bib goals into 3 canonical files + 1 bib file, then expand content systematically.

### Prioritized Goals

- **goal_6**: Create a minimal runnable computational skeleton in /outputs (or project root): a Python script/notebook + requirements (or pyproject) + one toy experiment demonstrating a key survey concept, since the deliverables audit shows only 3 markdown files (README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md) and 0 execution results.
- **goal_7**: Execute the created computational skeleton end-to-end and persist execution outputs (logs/plots/results) into /outputs, because the deliverables audit reports 0 test/execution results.
- **goal_8**: Create /outputs/roadmap_scope_success_criteria.md defining 'comprehensive survey v1' (scope boundaries, subtopic list, prioritization policy, and Definition of Done), since there are currently no dedicated planning documents in the audit.
- **goal_9**: Create /outputs/references.bib with an initial seed set + documented bib workflow (fields required, tagging, deduplication), because no bibliography artifact exists in the current deliverables set (only README.md/first_artifact.md/research_template.md).
- **goal_10**: Create /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or .md table) mapping subdomains -> core sources -> status (unread/skim/read/notes/verified) and define the 'read next' decision rule, since no analysis outputs or matrix artifacts exist yet.

- **Duration:** 86.6s

**Sample Insights:**
1. Well-posedness should be stated as a property of the parameter-to-solution map \mu\mapsto u(\mu), not just pointwise existence/uniqueness; continuity/differentiability/analyticity are central because they enable continuation, optimization gradients, and reduced-order surrogates....
2. Uniform-in-\mu a priori inequalities (coercivity, monotonicity, inf-sup, dissipativity, compactness) are the structural backbone: if they persist, stability and numerics are robust; if they degrade, one should expect boundary layers, stiffness, loss of regularity, nonuniqueness, and bifurcation-like...
3. The same energy/monotonicity estimate can simultaneously power existence proofs, stability/uniqueness arguments, and discretization error bounds—linking functional analysis directly to solver design and certified computation....

**Sample Findings:**
1. Across the analytical, practical, and historical perspectives, the unifying move is to treat a parametrized model not as many separate problems but as a single operator equation on a product space: find u(\mu) such that F(u,\mu)=0 between appropriate...

## Strategic Decisions

## 1) TOP 5 GOALS TO PRIORITIZE (next)

1) **goal_83 — Fix the known syntax error blocking the toy experiment from running**  
   *Rationale:* Multiple agents reported **syntax errors** in core modules (e.g., `src/goal_33_toy_experiment.py`, `src/renderers.py`, `src/deterministic_runner/plotting.py`, `src/plotting.py`, `scripts/run_pipeline.py`). Until these are fixed, “runnable end-to-end” can’t be reliably achieved.

2) **goal_89 — Ship a minimal runnable script + dependency spec + one command to run end-to-end**  
   *Rationale:* There is lots of partial scaffolding across agent folders, but the system still lacks a single stable entrypoint that a reviewer can run with one command and get deterministic outputs.

3) **goal_71 — Add pytest that asserts the pipeline creates expected artifacts + basic schema checks**  
   *Rationale:* This prevents regression and forces the pipeline to continuously produce the canonical artifacts needed for review (results JSON keys, logs, index presence, etc.).

4) **goal_72 — Execute the pipeline once and persist evidence (`run.log`, artifacts) + update `STATUS.md`/`index.md`**  
   *Rationale:* Even if code exists, without a committed evidence pack reviewers can’t verify it works. This is also how you close the loop on “Documents: 0 / Analysis: 0” appearing in audits.

5) **goal_39 — Create `outputs/roadmap_v1.md` with scope + DoD + 20-cycle plan**  
   *Rationale:* Current work is fragmented and drifting. A single canonical roadmap with Definition-of-Done and cycle plan anchors the research and makes the coverage matrix/bib meaningful.

---

## 2) KEY INSIGHTS (most important observations)

1) **Audit says “Documents: 0” despite many `.md` files because artifacts are being written to agent-specific paths**  
   Example from the audit:  
   `.../code-creation/agent_.../outputs/README.md` (and similar) rather than the repo’s canonical `./outputs/`.  
   Net effect: progress exists but is **invisible to the deliverables audit and reviewers**.

2) **The environment constraint “`/outputs` not writable” is causing path hacks (e.g., `/mnt/data/outputs` + symlink)**  
   That workaround may function in a sandbox, but the repo needs a **portable rule**: always write to a *relative* `./outputs/` path (repo-root), and never depend on absolute `/outputs`.

3) **Core pipeline is blocked by multiple syntax errors in key files**  
   Several agents succeeded in creating scaffolds, but repeated failures show the integration layer is unstable. This is the #1 “stop-the-line” issue.

4) **Work product fragmentation is high (125 files, 122 code files), but consolidation is low**  
   Many parallel minimal skeletons exist; without consolidation into one canonical pipeline, each new cycle risks adding more duplicate/unused code.

5) **Some execution evidence exists (3 test/execution results), but it’s not consistently discoverable in canonical `./outputs/`**  
   The system is very close to being reviewable—mostly blocked by *output placement + integration + syntax correctness*.

---

## 3) STRATEGIC DIRECTIVES (next 20 cycles)

1) **Canonicalize artifacts and paths (Cycle rule: “nothing counts unless it lands in `./outputs/`”)**  
   - Every cycle must update at least: `./outputs/index.md`, `./outputs/run.log` (or `run_*.log`), and one “substantive” artifact (results/coverage/bib/roadmap).  
   - Add/maintain an explicit “artifact contract” (filenames + required keys).

2) **Converge to ONE pipeline + ONE entrypoint + ONE output schema (delete/ignore duplicates)**  
   - Pick a single canonical runner script (e.g., `scripts/run_pipeline.py`).  
   - Ensure it: sets seed, writes deterministic artifacts, exits nonzero on failure.  
   - Consolidate scattered modules created by different agents into one package layout.

3) **Make correctness enforceable via tests and schemas**  
   - Pytest smoke tests must assert: outputs directory created, required files exist, JSON validates minimal schema.  
   - This turns “we think it runs” into “CI-verifiable.”

4) **Lock a minimal “north star” topic definition + coverage matrix + bib workflow**  
   - One paragraph scope statement in roadmap.  
   - Coverage matrix must map scope → subtopics → references → note files.  
   - Bibliography system must be parseable (bibtex lint) and linked from index.

5) **Produce an “evidence pack” every cycle (run metadata + environment capture)**  
   - Save `python --version`, `pip freeze`/`uv pip freeze`, OS, timestamp, git commit hash into `./outputs/run_stamp.json`.  
   - This prevents “it worked on my machine” and supports audit/QA.

---

## 4) URGENT GOALS TO CREATE (deliverables-based gaps)

The deliverables audit still shows **Documents: 0** and “recent files created” are under agent-specific directories (e.g., `.../code-creation/agent_.../outputs/README.md`). That is a **high-severity discoverability gap**. Also, repeated **syntax errors** are a **high-severity runnable gap**.

Create these urgent goals:

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Promote/copy all existing markdown artifacts currently located under agent-specific paths (e.g., /Users/jtr/_JTR23_/COSMO/code-creation/agent_*/outputs/README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md) into the repo-canonical ./outputs/ directory, and add/refresh ./outputs/index.md linking to them so the deliverables audit counts Documents > 0.",
    "agentType": "document_creation",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Audit reports Documents: 0 because .md artifacts are not in canonical ./outputs. This blocks reviewability and makes progress appear nonexistent."
  },
  {
    "description": "Fix all currently reported syntax errors blocking end-to-end execution (at minimum: src/goal_33_toy_experiment.py, scripts/run_pipeline.py, src/renderers.py, src/deterministic_runner/plotting.py, src/plotting.py) and add a pre-commit/CI-style check (python -m compileall or ruff) so syntax errors cannot be reintroduced unnoticed.",
    "agentType": "code_creation",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Multiple agents flagged syntax_error failures in core pipeline modules; this is the primary blocker preventing goal_89/goal_72 completion."
  },
  {
    "description": "Standardize output writing to use a relative repo path ./outputs (not absolute /outputs and not environment-specific /mnt/data/outputs). Update the pipeline so it creates ./outputs if missing and writes run.log, run_stamp.json, and results.json deterministically on every run.",
    "agentType": "code_creation",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Agents reported /outputs permission denied and redirected to /mnt/data/outputs with symlinks; this is non-portable and contributes to audit discoverability failures."
  },
  {
    "description": "Run the canonical pipeline and test suite once after fixes, and commit an evidence pack under ./outputs/ (run.log, test.log or test_run_log.json, run_stamp.json, results.json, and updated index.md).",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Even with code present, the project remains unreviewable without canonical execution artifacts; audit currently has only 3 test/execution results and documents are not being counted."
  }
]
```

### Minimal “success criteria” for the next checkpoint (so the audit flips green)
- Deliverables audit shows **Documents > 0** (because `./outputs/*.md` exists in canonical path).  
- One command runs end-to-end (goal_89) and writes deterministic artifacts into `./outputs/`.  
- Tests pass and assert artifact existence/schema (goal_71).  
- `./outputs/index.md` links to roadmap, coverage matrix, bib, and the latest run evidence (goal_72 + goal_39).

If you want, I can also propose a tight 20-cycle schedule (cycle-by-cycle) aligned to these directives—but the above is the immediate strategic action plan that unblocks review and execution fastest.
