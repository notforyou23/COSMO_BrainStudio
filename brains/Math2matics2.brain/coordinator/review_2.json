    "content": "## 1) Top 5 goals to prioritize (by goal ID) + rationale\n\n1. **goal_guided_research_1766538132773**  \n   *Rationale:* Only existing portfolio goal; currently 0 progress. Needs immediate scoping, structure, and concrete outputs so “research” becomes trackable.\n\n2. **(to create) goal_outputs_bootstrap_20251224_01**  \n   *Rationale:* Deliverables audit shows **0 files created** despite an outputs directory existing. Highest priority is to force tangible artifacts each cycle.\n\n3. **(to create) goal_research_roadmap_success_criteria_20251224_02**  \n   *Rationale:* Review explicitly flags missing **scope narrowing & success criteria**; without this, “comprehensive” stays ambiguous and progress can’t be measured.\n\n4. **(to create) goal_bibliography_system_pipeline_20251224_03**  \n   *Rationale:* Missing **bibliography system** and tagging taxonomy blocks scaling; also prevents reuse, citation chaining, and de-duplication.\n\n5. **(to create) goal_coverage_matrix_eval_loop_20251224_04**  \n   *Rationale:* Review notes missing **coverage tracking + evaluation loop**; without these, depth may be high but coherence and cross-linking will remain weak.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Key insights (most important observations)\n\n1. **Critical implementation gap:** The system is “thinking” but not “shipping.” The deliverables audit shows **0 files** created (no docs, no code, no tests), meaning there’s currently no persistent artifact trail.\n\n2. **Single-goal portfolio is under-specified:** Only one goal exists and it has **0 progress**; it’s too broad to execute without sub-goals and explicit deliverables.\n\n3. **Strength is depth; weakness is consolidation:** Depth is strong (8/10) and novelty good (7/10), but coherence is lower (6/10) with repetition and **limited cross-referencing** between ideas.\n\n4. **Missing operational infrastructure:** The review explicitly calls out absent components: roadmap/syllabus, bibliography workflow, output artifacts, and evaluation loop. These are prerequisites for sustained progress.\n\n5. **Early-stage knowledge graph:** Memory network density is effectively zero; connections aren’t forming because artifacts/notes aren’t being captured in a structured, linkable way.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Strategic directives (next 20 cycles)\n\n1. **Adopt a “Ship Every Cycle” rule (non-negotiable).**  \n   Every cycle must produce at least one committed artifact in `/outputs/` (e.g., `annotated_bib.md`, `theorem_note.md`, `reading_queue.yaml`, `coverage_matrix.csv`, or a small notebook/script). No artifact = failed cycle.\n\n2. **Convert “comprehensive research” into a deliverable spec + timebox.**  \n   Define what “done” looks like per domain/subdomain (e.g., “5 textbooks, 5 surveys, 10 seminal papers, 20 key results, 3 open problems”), with an explicit horizon (e.g., 20 cycles = v1).\n\n3. **Standardize the research intake template and enforce it.**  \n   Create a single source-note template (citation, prerequisites, key results, 5–10 bullet summary, examples, forward/backward citation targets). No reading without producing a completed template entry.\n\n4. **Implement a coverage matrix + weekly review loop.**  \n   Maintain a matrix (domains × subtopics × artifact types: sources/proofs/examples/datasets/open problems). Every 5 cycles, run a gap review: what’s thin, what’s redundant, what’s next.\n\n5. **Force cross-linking to improve coherence.**  \n   Each new note must link to at least 2 prior notes (or explicitly state “no links found yet” and why). This directly addresses the low network density and coherence.\n\n---\n\n## 4) URGENT goals to create (deliverables-based action)\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Goal ID: goal_outputs_bootstrap_20251224_01 — Create tangible artifacts in /outputs/ to fix the deliverables audit showing 0 files created.
