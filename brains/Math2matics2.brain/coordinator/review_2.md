## Cognitive Work Analysis

1) Quality Assessment (1–10)
- Depth: 8 — detailed reasoning and examples provided
- Novelty: 7 — exploring fresh territory beyond tracked themes
- Coherence: 6 — focused but somewhat repetitive

2) Dominant Themes
- Exploring territory beyond standard tracked themes

3) Intellectual Progress
Consistent depth maintained across the period, though limited explicit cross-referencing between ideas.

4) Gaps & Blind Spots
No major blind spots detected. Exploration appears well-distributed across multiple conceptual areas.

5) Standout Insights (breakthrough potential)
- 1: analyst — The derivative at x is the slope of the best local linear predictor of a function’s values: taking an infinitesimal neighborhood and minimizing mean-squared error yields the tangent line. This connect...

## Goal Portfolio Evaluation

1) **Top 5 Priority Goals (immediate focus)**
- **goal_guided_research_1766538132773** (only goal; highest priority; 0 progress)

2) **Goals to Merge**
- None (only one goal)

3) **Goals to Archive**
- None (not over-pursued; no mandate triggers)

4) **Missing Directions (not represented)**
- **Scope narrowing & success criteria** (what “comprehensive” means; timebox; deliverables)
- **Bibliography system** (Zotero/Obsidian/LaTeX bibtex workflow; tagging taxonomy)
- **Syllabus/roadmap** (sequence across domains; prerequisites; depth targets)
- **Output artifacts** (annotated bibliography, theorem/proof notes, problem sets, code notebooks)
- **Evaluation loop** (periodic reviews; coverage tracking; gaps/open-problems log)

5) **Pursuit Strategy (for goal_guided_research_1766538132773)**
- **Define deliverables + constraints**: e.g., per domain: 5 textbooks, 5 surveys, 10 seminal papers, 20 key theorems/examples, 3 open-problem pointers; set a timebox.
- **Build a repeatable template** for each source: citation, 5–10 bullet summary, key results, prerequisites, worked examples/datasets, links to follow-ups.
- **Triage by impact**: start with standard texts/surveys, then branch via citation chains (backward/forward).
- **Track coverage** in a matrix (domains × subtopics × “source/proof/example/dataset/open problem”).
- **Ship weekly artifacts**: annotated bibliography updates + 1–2 polished theorem notes + 1 small simulation/notebook where applicable.

### Prioritized Goals

- **goal_guided_research_1766538132773**: Comprehensively survey the modern and classical literature across the target domains (algebra, calculus, geometry, probability, statistics, discrete math, and mathematical modeling). Collect seminal papers, textbooks, survey articles, key theorems, canonical examples, and open problems. Prioritize sources that include proofs, worked examples, and datasets or simulation examples.

## Memory Network Analysis

1) Emerging knowledge domains
- Diverse knowledge base forming across multiple domains

2) Key concepts (central nodes)
1. [AGENT: agent_1766538161484_b5yh91f] Cycle 1 consistency review (divergence 0.97 (activation: 1.00)
2. The derivative at x is the slope of the best local linear predictor of a functio (activation: 0.00)

3) Connection patterns
- Network density: 0.0 connections per node
- Strong connections: 0
- Connections still forming, early stage network

4) Gaps to bridge
Limited connections detected. System still in early knowledge accumulation phase.
Recommendation: Continue exploration to build foundational knowledge base.

5) Consolidation opportunities
Network still growing. Consolidation not yet needed.

## Strategic Decisions

## 1) Top 5 goals to prioritize (by goal ID) + rationale

1. **goal_guided_research_1766538132773**  
   *Rationale:* Only existing portfolio goal; currently 0 progress. Needs immediate scoping, structure, and concrete outputs so “research” becomes trackable.

2. **(to create) goal_outputs_bootstrap_20251224_01**  
   *Rationale:* Deliverables audit shows **0 files created** despite an outputs directory existing. Highest priority is to force tangible artifacts each cycle.

3. **(to create) goal_research_roadmap_success_criteria_20251224_02**  
   *Rationale:* Review explicitly flags missing **scope narrowing & success criteria**; without this, “comprehensive” stays ambiguous and progress can’t be measured.

4. **(to create) goal_bibliography_system_pipeline_20251224_03**  
   *Rationale:* Missing **bibliography system** and tagging taxonomy blocks scaling; also prevents reuse, citation chaining, and de-duplication.

5. **(to create) goal_coverage_matrix_eval_loop_20251224_04**  
   *Rationale:* Review notes missing **coverage tracking + evaluation loop**; without these, depth may be high but coherence and cross-linking will remain weak.

---

## 2) Key insights (most important observations)

1. **Critical implementation gap:** The system is “thinking” but not “shipping.” The deliverables audit shows **0 files** created (no docs, no code, no tests), meaning there’s currently no persistent artifact trail.

2. **Single-goal portfolio is under-specified:** Only one goal exists and it has **0 progress**; it’s too broad to execute without sub-goals and explicit deliverables.

3. **Strength is depth; weakness is consolidation:** Depth is strong (8/10) and novelty good (7/10), but coherence is lower (6/10) with repetition and **limited cross-referencing** between ideas.

4. **Missing operational infrastructure:** The review explicitly calls out absent components: roadmap/syllabus, bibliography workflow, output artifacts, and evaluation loop. These are prerequisites for sustained progress.

5. **Early-stage knowledge graph:** Memory network density is effectively zero; connections aren’t forming because artifacts/notes aren’t being captured in a structured, linkable way.

---

## 3) Strategic directives (next 20 cycles)

1. **Adopt a “Ship Every Cycle” rule (non-negotiable).**  
   Every cycle must produce at least one committed artifact in `/outputs/` (e.g., `annotated_bib.md`, `theorem_note.md`, `reading_queue.yaml`, `coverage_matrix.csv`, or a small notebook/script). No artifact = failed cycle.

2. **Convert “comprehensive research” into a deliverable spec + timebox.**  
   Define what “done” looks like per domain/subdomain (e.g., “5 textbooks, 5 surveys, 10 seminal papers, 20 key results, 3 open problems”), with an explicit horizon (e.g., 20 cycles = v1).

3. **Standardize the research intake template and enforce it.**  
   Create a single source-note template (citation, prerequisites, key results, 5–10 bullet summary, examples, forward/backward citation targets). No reading without producing a completed template entry.

4. **Implement a coverage matrix + weekly review loop.**  
   Maintain a matrix (domains × subtopics × artifact types: sources/proofs/examples/datasets/open problems). Every 5 cycles, run a gap review: what’s thin, what’s redundant, what’s next.

5. **Force cross-linking to improve coherence.**  
   Each new note must link to at least 2 prior notes (or explicitly state “no links found yet” and why). This directly addresses the low network density and coherence.

### Practical “next cycle” checklist (so this plan executes immediately)
- Create the three baseline files in `/outputs/` (README, template, first completed note).
- Decide initial domain focus for v1 (even if provisional) and encode it into `roadmap_v1.md`.
- Seed `references.bib` with 5 high-impact sources + 1 paragraph per source in the template format.
- Start `coverage_matrix.csv` and mark what’s already covered vs. empty.

If you tell me the intended research domain(s) for **goal_guided_research_1766538132773**, I can tailor the roadmap structure (subtopics, canonical texts, survey sequence, and the first 10 sources to seed the bibliography) while keeping the same deliverables-first operating model.

### Key Insights

1. **Critical implementation gap:** The system is “thinking” but not “shipping.” The deliverables audit shows **0 files** created (no docs, no code, no tests), meaning there’s currently no persistent artifact trail.

### Strategic Directives

1. **Adopt a “Ship Every Cycle” rule (non-negotiable).**
2. **Convert “comprehensive research” into a deliverable spec + timebox.**
3. **Standardize the research intake template and enforce it.**
