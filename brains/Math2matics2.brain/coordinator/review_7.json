          "Cycle 1 consistency review (divergence 0.97):\nSummary (high-level): The three branches are about different domains (linear dynamics, local linear approximation, and Bayesian updating), but they share themes of local linearity and multiplicative vs additive updates. There are no factual contradictions; instead there are useful analogies and some domain-specific caveats that should be checked before applying each statement.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All three emphasize linear/linearized structure as central to understanding behavior:\n  - Branch 1: long-term behavior of linear maps is governed by eigenvalues (and, implicitly, the linear structure).\n  - Branch 2: the derivative is the best local linear predictor (local linearization).\n  - Branch 3: belief updates are multiplicative in odds (a simple linear structure in log-space).\n- Multiplicative effects are key:\n  - Branch 1: eigenvalues multiply state components each step (growth/decay).\n  - Branch 3: likelihood ratios multiply odds across sequential evidence.\n- Importance of additional structure beyond leading scalars:\n  - Branch 1 warns that eigenvalues alone don’t give full dynamics if the matrix is defective (need geometric multiplicities / Jordan structure).\n  - Branch 2 implicitly requires regularity (differentiability; appropriate limit/weighting) for the OLS interpretation to hold.\n  - Branch 3 requires knowing models P(evidence|H) and P(evidence|¬H) and careful conditioning for sequential updates.\n\n2) Conflicting points or potential misunderstandings (none are direct contradictions; these are caveats to watch)\n- Branch 1 vs naive scalar-only interpretation:\n  - Potential misapplication: treating eigenvalues alone as sufficient can be wrong for non-diagonalizable matrices. That contradicts any simplified claim that only |λ| determines all long-term behavior.\n- Branch 2’s statistical claim requires limits/assumptions:\n  - The statement that the derivative equals the OLS local linear estimator is true in the limit under appropriate weighting (vanishing neighborhood, symmetric weighting, differentiability). Without those conditions (e.g., noisy data, finite window, heteroskedasticity), finite-sample OLS estimates can differ from the true derivative.\n- Numerical/stability considerations (Branch 3 vs practical computation):\n  - Branch 3’s multiplicative updates are correct, but working in odds can suffer underflow/overflow for extreme probabilities; using log-odds is standard for numerical stability and for turning multiplicative updates into additive ones.\n- Analogy limits:\n  - Drawing direct operational equivalence between eigenvalue growth and likelihood-ratio updates is an analogy, not a theorem. Mapping requires careful definition (e.g., interpreting multiplicative growth per time-step vs multiplicative change in odds per evidence item).\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Treat these as complementary tools and check domain assumptions before applying:\n  - For linear dynamics (Branch 1): always examine the full Jordan form (or compute geometric multiplicities and generalized eigenvectors). If non-diagonalizable, account for polynomial factors (t·λ^t terms) when predicting long-term growth. Use spectral radius and Jordan block sizes to get refined asymptotics.\n  - For local estimation (Branch 2): if you need a derivative from data, use weighted local regression with vanishing bandwidth or use methods designed for derivative estimation and check smoothness assumptions. For noisy finite data, quantify bias/variance and confidence intervals.\n  - For belief updating (Branch 3): use odds or, better, log-odds for sequential updating (posterior log-odds = prior log-odds + log-likelihood-ratio). Ensure model correctness and independence/conditioning assumptions when combining evidence.\n- If you want an integrated viewpoint / concrete mapping:\n  - Use linearization (Jacobian) of a dynamical or inference process to connect Branch 1 and Branch 2: derivatives (Branch 2) produce Jacobians; eigenvalues of Jacobians (Branch 1) govern local stability of iterative maps (including iterative belief updates modeled as continuous states).\n  - Use logs to convert multiplicative processes into additive rates: eigenvalue magnitudes correspond to growth factors per step; log(|λ|) is a growth rate (like information gain per datum = expected log-likelihood-ratio). This ties Branch 1 and 3 conceptually and aids numerical stability.\n- Practical checklist to avoid pitfalls:\n  - Verify differentiability / smoothness before using Branch 2’s OLS-as-derivative idea.\n  - Check diagonalizability or use Jordan analysis for Branch 1.\n  - Use log-odds for numerical stability and additivity when implementing Branch 3.\n  - When modeling iterative belief or state updates, compute Jacobian eigenvalues and expected log-likelihood contributions to predict long-run behavior.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Give a short worked example showing (a) how a defective 2×2 matrix produces polynomial growth despite |λ|≤1, (b) derive derivative-as-OLS in the limit, or (c) show a small sequence of odds and log-odds updates and numerical stability benefits.

        ],
        "sampleFindings": [
          "Across the analytical, practical, and historical perspectives, the unifying move is to treat a parametrized model not as many separate problems but as a single operator equation on a product space: find u(\\mu) such that F(u,\\mu)=0 between appropriate Banach/Hilbert spaces. This reframing upgrades “existence for each \\mu” into statements about the parameter-to-solution map \\mu\\mapsto u(\\mu): continuity, Lipschitz stability, differentiability (implicit-function theorem), and analyticity (spectral/Kato-type perturbation). Those properties are what make continuation, calibration, optimization gradients, reduced-order surrogates, and uncertainty quantification mathematically meaningful.\n\nA recurring pattern is that the decisive hypotheses are not merely local-in-\\mu solvability conditions but uniform-in-\\mu inequalities (coercivity/ellipticity constants, monotonicity moduli, inf-sup constants, dissipativity bounds, compactness). These same a priori estimates function as a “triple-use currency”: they prove existence (via compactness/weak lower semicontinuity), uniqueness and stability (via strong monotonicity/Grönwall), and numerical reliability (Céa/Lax equivalence, residual-based a posteriori bounds). When such bounds degrade near a critical parameter, the theory predicts—and applications observe—stiffness, boundary layers, loss of regularity, nonuniqueness/selection effects, and regime changes that standard discretizations may mis-handle.\n\nStability and bifurcation analysis further tie the perspectives together through linearization and spectrum: L(\\mu)=D_uF(u(\\mu),\\mu) governs decay rates, eigenvalue crossings, and the feasibility of center-manifold/normal-form reductions. Regularity is not merely “smoother solutions”; it controls whether spectral perturbation arguments and reduction techniques are valid in the topology where the dynamics lives. Historically, this connects the evolution from explicit formulas to function-space methods (Lax–Milgram, Galerkin+compactness, monotone operators) and then to modern validated numerics, where the same inequalities are converted into computer-checkable certificates for equilibria, invariant sets, and even bifurcation diagrams.\n\nOverall, the integrated understanding is that rigorous formalization of parametrized problems is best organized around (i) the solution map’s well-posedness in the right spaces, (ii) uniform structural estimates that survive parameter variation, and (iii) spectral/dynamical diagnostics for regime transitions—so that analysis, computation, and applications share the same verifiable “control knobs.”"

          "Cycle 4 consistency review (divergence 0.96):\nSummary judgement: the three branches are largely compatible within a Bayesian framework but emphasize different goals. Branch 1 focuses on decision-quality and sensitivity to priors; Branch 2 frames surprise as an attention/exploration driver; Branch 3 gives a practical conjugate-prior recipe for online belief updates. These can be combined, but there are trade-offs to manage.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All three operate within a Bayesian probability framework: beliefs are encoded as priors and updated to posteriors via likelihoods (Bayes’ theorem).\n- Priors matter: Branch 1’s point that priors can dominate posteriors with only moderate evidence is consistent with Branch 3’s emphasis on explicitly encoding prior strength (α,β).\n- Surprise is prior-dependent: Branch 2’s surprise measure (−log P) is computed from the predictive distribution, which itself follows from the prior and likelihood used in Branch 3—so surprise and Bayesian updating are mathematically compatible.\n- Practical online updating + attention: using conjugate priors (Branch 3) makes it straightforward to compute predictive probabilities and thus surprise signals (Branch 2) in an online system.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Emphasis vs. action conflict: Branch 1 argues for relying on better priors or much stronger evidence to make decisions, while Branch 2 promotes exploratory attention to surprising (informative) events. That can look like a contradiction when exploration invites evidence that temporarily reduces reliance on priors.\n- Weighting of signals: Branch 2’s curiosity-driven behavior could lead an agent to over-sample low-probability but high-surprise events, which may harm short-term decision quality if priors were reliable (Branch 1). The implicit trade-off is exploration (information gain) vs. exploitation (acting on prior-informed posterior).\n- Modeling simplicity vs. expressiveness: Branch 3’s conjugate-prior recommendation (Beta-Binomial) is computationally convenient but restrictive. If the true data-generating process or the attention policy requires richer likelihoods or hierarchical structure, the conjugate choice may underfit and misestimate surprise or posterior sensitivity (affecting Branches 1 and 2).\n- Interpretation of “moderately unlikely”: Branch 2’s phrase “moderately unlikely events” (high information gain) can be ambiguous relative to Branch 1’s “moderately informative evidence.” Without formal information measures, these notions can lead to different behaviors.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Adopt a unified architecture:\n  - Use conjugate priors where appropriate for online efficiency (Branch 3) and compute posterior and posterior predictive analytically.\n  - Compute surprise as −log p_predict(x) (Branch 2) from the posterior predictive; use expected information gain (KL divergence between posterior and expected posterior) to quantify exploration value.\n  - Use Bayes factors / posterior sensitivity analysis to quantify when priors dominate (Branch 1) and to decide whether to defer to the prior or seek more evidence.\n- Resolve the exploration–exploitation tension:\n  - Implement an explicit trade-off policy: e.g., Thompson sampling or an acquisition function that balances expected utility (exploitation) and expected information gain (exploration). Tune the trade-off by prior strength (α,β) or an exploration temperature.\n- Make priors explicit and adaptive:\n  - Encode prior strength (α,β) transparently and perform prior predictive checks. If prior-dominance is problematic, weaken priors or add hierarchical priors to learn prior hyperparameters from data.\n- If model simplicity is limiting:\n  - Move from simple conjugate forms to structured/hierarchical Bayesian models (or variational/particle filters) when likelihoods are complex or when surprise signals look systematically miscalibrated.\n- Monitoring and diagnostics:\n  - Regularly compute metrics: posterior sensitivity to prior (e.g., vary α,β), average surprise, and realized information gain. Use these to adapt exploration weighting or to revise priors.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Produce concrete formulas and pseudocode for (a) Beta-Binomial online updates + surprise computation, and (b) a Thompson-sampling + info-gain acquisition rule that balances Branch 1 vs Branch 2 objectives."

There are no factual contradictions; instead there are useful analogies and some domain-specific caveats that should be checked before applying each statement.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All three emphasize linear/linearized structure as central to understanding behavior:\n  - Branch 1: long-term behavior of linear maps is governed by eigenvalues (and, implicitly, the linear structure).\n  - Branch 2: the derivative is the best local linear predictor (local linearization).\n  - Branch 3: belief updates are multiplicative in odds (a simple linear structure in log-space).\n- Multiplicative effects are key:\n  - Branch 1: eigenvalues multiply state components each step (growth/decay).\n  - Branch 3: likelihood ratios multiply odds across sequential evidence.\n- Importance of additional structure beyond leading scalars:\n  - Branch 1 warns that eigenvalues alone don’t give full dynamics if the matrix is defective (need geometric multiplicities / Jordan structure).\n  - Branch 2 implicitly requires regularity (differentiability; appropriate limit/weighting) for the OLS interpretation to hold.\n  - Branch 3 requires knowing models P(evidence|H) and P(evidence|¬H) and careful conditioning for sequential updates.\n\n2) Conflicting points or potential misunderstandings (none are direct contradictions; these are caveats to watch)\n- Branch 1 vs naive scalar-only interpretation:\n  - Potential misapplication: treating eigenvalues alone as sufficient can be wrong for non-diagonalizable matrices. That contradicts any simplified claim that only |λ| determines all long-term behavior.\n- Branch 2’s statistical claim requires limits/assumptions:\n  - The statement that the derivative equals the OLS local linear estimator is true in the limit under appropriate weighting (vanishing neighborhood, symmetric weighting, differentiability). Without those conditions (e.g., noisy data, finite window, heteroskedasticity), finite-sample OLS estimates can differ from the true derivative.\n- Numerical/stability considerations (Branch 3 vs practical computation):\n  - Branch 3’s multiplicative updates are correct, but working in odds can suffer underflow/overflow for extreme probabilities; using log-odds is standard for numerical stability and for turning multiplicative updates into additive ones.\n- Analogy limits:\n  - Drawing direct operational equivalence between eigenvalue growth and likelihood-ratio updates is an analogy, not a theorem. Mapping requires careful definition (e.g., interpreting multiplicative growth per time-step vs multiplicative change in odds per evidence item).\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Treat these as complementary tools and check domain assumptions before applying:\n  - For linear dynamics (Branch 1): always examine the full Jordan form (or compute geometric multiplicities and generalized eigenvectors). If non-diagonalizable, account for polynomial factors (t·λ^t terms) when predicting long-term growth. Use spectral radius and Jordan block sizes to get refined asymptotics.\n  - For local estimation (Branch 2): if you need a derivative from data, use weighted local regression with vanishing bandwidth or use methods designed for derivative estimation and check smoothness assumptions. For noisy finite data, quantify bias/variance and confidence intervals.\n  - For belief updating (Branch 3): use odds or, better, log-odds for sequential updating (posterior log-odds = prior log-odds + log-likelihood-ratio). Ensure model correctness and independence/conditioning assumptions when combining evidence.\n- If you want an integrated viewpoint / concrete mapping:\n  - Use linearization (Jacobian) of a dynamical or inference process to connect Branch 1 and Branch 2: derivatives (Branch 2) produce Jacobians; eigenvalues of Jacobians (Branch 1) govern local stability of iterative maps (including iterative belief updates modeled as continuous states).\n  - Use logs to convert multiplicative processes into additive rates: eigenvalue magnitudes correspond to growth factors per step; log(|λ|) is a growth rate (like information gain per datum = expected log-likelihood-ratio). This ties Branch 1 and 3 conceptually and aids numerical stability.\n- Practical checklist to avoid pitfalls:\n  - Verify differentiability / smoothness before using Branch 2’s OLS-as-derivative idea.\n  - Check diagonalizability or use Jordan analysis for Branch 1.\n  - Use log-odds for numerical stability and additivity when implementing Branch 3.\n  - When modeling iterative belief or state updates, compute Jacobian eigenvalues and expected log-likelihood contributions to predict long-run behavior.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Give a short worked example showing (a) how a defective 2×2 matrix produces polynomial growth despite |λ|≤1, (b) derive derivative-as-OLS in the limit, or (c) show a small sequence of odds and log-odds updates and numerical stability benefits.

        "content": "Across the analytical, practical, and historical perspectives, the unifying move is to treat a parametrized model not as many separate problems but as a single operator equation on a product space: find u(\\mu) such that F(u,\\mu)=0 between appropriate Banach/Hilbert spaces. This reframing upgrades “existence for each \\mu” into statements about the parameter-to-solution map \\mu\\mapsto u(\\mu): continuity, Lipschitz stability, differentiability (implicit-function theorem), and analyticity (spectral/Kato-type perturbation). Those properties are what make continuation, calibration, optimization gradients, reduced-order surrogates, and uncertainty quantification mathematically meaningful.\n\nA recurring pattern is that the decisive hypotheses are not merely local-in-\\mu solvability conditions but uniform-in-\\mu inequalities (coercivity/ellipticity constants, monotonicity moduli, inf-sup constants, dissipativity bounds, compactness). These same a priori estimates function as a “triple-use currency”: they prove existence (via compactness/weak lower semicontinuity), uniqueness and stability (via strong monotonicity/Grönwall), and numerical reliability (Céa/Lax equivalence, residual-based a posteriori bounds). When such bounds degrade near a critical parameter, the theory predicts—and applications observe—stiffness, boundary layers, loss of regularity, nonuniqueness/selection effects, and regime changes that standard discretizations may mis-handle.\n\nStability and bifurcation analysis further tie the perspectives together through linearization and spectrum: L(\\mu)=D_uF(u(\\mu),\\mu) governs decay rates, eigenvalue crossings, and the feasibility of center-manifold/normal-form reductions. Regularity is not merely “smoother solutions”; it controls whether spectral perturbation arguments and reduction techniques are valid in the topology where the dynamics lives. Historically, this connects the evolution from explicit formulas to function-space methods (Lax–Milgram, Galerkin+compactness, monotone operators) and then to modern validated numerics, where the same inequalities are converted into computer-checkable certificates for equilibria, invariant sets, and even bifurcation diagrams.\n\nOverall, the integrated understanding is that rigorous formalization of parametrized problems is best organized around (i) the solution map’s well-posedness in the right spaces, (ii) uniform structural estimates that survive parameter variation, and (iii) spectral/dynamical diagnostics for regime transitions—so that analysis, computation, and applications share the same verifiable “control knobs.”",

        "content": "Cycle 4 consistency review (divergence 0.96):\nSummary judgement: the three branches are largely compatible within a Bayesian framework but emphasize different goals. Branch 1 focuses on decision-quality and sensitivity to priors; Branch 2 frames surprise as an attention/exploration driver; Branch 3 gives a practical conjugate-prior recipe for online belief updates. These can be combined, but there are trade-offs to manage.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All three operate within a Bayesian probability framework: beliefs are encoded as priors and updated to posteriors via likelihoods (Bayes’ theorem).\n- Priors matter: Branch 1’s point that priors can dominate posteriors with only moderate evidence is consistent with Branch 3’s emphasis on explicitly encoding prior strength (α,β).\n- Surprise is prior-dependent: Branch 2’s surprise measure (−log P) is computed from the predictive distribution, which itself follows from the prior and likelihood used in Branch 3—so surprise and Bayesian updating are mathematically compatible.\n- Practical online updating + attention: using conjugate priors (Branch 3) makes it straightforward to compute predictive probabilities and thus surprise signals (Branch 2) in an online system.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Emphasis vs. action conflict: Branch 1 argues for relying on better priors or much stronger evidence to make decisions, while Branch 2 promotes exploratory attention to surprising (informative) events. That can look like a contradiction when exploration invites evidence that temporarily reduces reliance on priors.\n- Weighting of signals: Branch 2’s curiosity-driven behavior could lead an agent to over-sample low-probability but high-surprise events, which may harm short-term decision quality if priors were reliable (Branch 1). The implicit trade-off is exploration (information gain) vs. exploitation (acting on prior-informed posterior).\n- Modeling simplicity vs. expressiveness: Branch 3’s conjugate-prior recommendation (Beta-Binomial) is computationally convenient but restrictive. If the true data-generating process or the attention policy requires richer likelihoods or hierarchical structure, the conjugate choice may underfit and misestimate surprise or posterior sensitivity (affecting Branches 1 and 2).\n- Interpretation of “moderately unlikely”: Branch 2’s phrase “moderately unlikely events” (high information gain) can be ambiguous relative to Branch 1’s “moderately informative evidence.” Without formal information measures, these notions can lead to different behaviors.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Adopt a unified architecture:\n  - Use conjugate priors where appropriate for online efficiency (Branch 3) and compute posterior and posterior predictive analytically.\n  - Compute surprise as −log p_predict(x) (Branch 2) from the posterior predictive; use expected information gain (KL divergence between posterior and expected posterior) to quantify exploration value.\n  - Use Bayes factors / posterior sensitivity analysis to quantify when priors dominate (Branch 1) and to decide whether to defer to the prior or seek more evidence.\n- Resolve the exploration–exploitation tension:\n  - Implement an explicit trade-off policy: e.g., Thompson sampling or an acquisition function that balances expected utility (exploitation) and expected information gain (exploration). Tune the trade-off by prior strength (α,β) or an exploration temperature.\n- Make priors explicit and adaptive:\n  - Encode prior strength (α,β) transparently and perform prior predictive checks. If prior-dominance is problematic, weaken priors or add hierarchical priors to learn prior hyperparameters from data.\n- If model simplicity is limiting:\n  - Move from simple conjugate forms to structured/hierarchical Bayesian models (or variational/particle filters) when likelihoods are complex or when surprise signals look systematically miscalibrated.\n- Monitoring and diagnostics:\n  - Regularly compute metrics: posterior sensitivity to prior (e.g., vary α,β), average surprise, and realized information gain. Use these to adapt exploration weighting or to revise priors.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Produce concrete formulas and pseudocode for (a) Beta-Binomial online updates + surprise computation, and (b) a Thompson-sampling + info-gain acquisition rule that balances Branch 1 vs Branch 2 objectives.",

    "content": "## 1) Top 5 goals to prioritize (by goal ID)\n\n1) **goal_2 — roadmap + scope/success criteria**  \n   *Rationale:* “Comprehensive survey” is currently undefined. This goal unblocks every downstream decision (what to read first, what “done” means, how to evaluate coverage).\n\n2) **goal_3 — bibliography workflow + seed BibTeX**  \n   *Rationale:* There is no scalable intake mechanism yet. A working BibTeX + triage workflow prevents repeated ad‑hoc source handling and enables reproducible citation tracking.\n\n3) **goal_4 — coverage matrix + evaluation loop**  \n   *Rationale:* Prevents drift. Converts “we read a lot” into measurable coverage across subtopics + a clear “read next” decision rule.\n\n4) **goal_guided_research_1766538132773 — execute actual literature surveying**  \n   *Rationale:* This is the core value delivery. It should run *after* goals 2–4 so outputs are structured, auditable, and cumulative.\n\n5) **goal_5 — (merge into goal_guided_research_1766538132773)**  \n   *Rationale:* It’s redundant and represents a prior blocked attempt. Keep it as a postmortem/checklist item inside the main research goal (especially the “No content received” failure mode).\n\n---\n\n## 2) Key insights (most important observations)\n\n1) **Deliverables are still thin and non-validating.**  \n   Audit shows **3 files created** (all in `/outputs/`: `README.md`, `first_artifact.md`, `research_template.md`) and **0 tests/execution results**. This fixes “zero artifacts” but not “proof of working pipeline.”\n\n2) **There’s a persistent “think > ship” failure mode.**  \n   The system produces conceptual insights (well-posedness, stability, expectation pitfalls), but those aren’t yet converted into persistent assets: bibliography, coverage map, structured notes, or runnable experiments.\n\n3) **The next bottleneck is governance, not intelligence.**  \n   The analysis indicates good depth/novelty, but coherence/repeat risk remains because scope, prioritization, and evaluation are not operationalized.\n\n4) **Reliability issues must be designed around (“No content received”).**  \n   One agent reported `Error: No content received...` which implies the workflow needs checkpoints, retries, and “partial-save” behavior to avoid losing cycles.\n\n5) **There is an emerging unifying backbone worth centering:**  \n   Parameter-to-solution maps + uniform a priori estimates link existence/uniqueness/stability to numerics and experiments. That’s a strong organizing spine for the survey—if we encode it into the scope/matrix.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Strategic directives (next ~20 cycles)\n\n1) **Convert “comprehensive” into a v1 contract (scope + acceptance tests).**  \n   Define: domains/subdomains, target number of sources per subdomain, what counts as “covered,” and what artifacts must exist at v1 (e.g., BibTeX size, matrix completeness, note quality bar).\n\n2) **Stand up the minimum reproducible research pipeline (MRRP).**  \n   Concretely: standardized note template (already started), BibTeX file, coverage matrix, and a folder convention. Add a “save early, save often” rule and periodic snapshots.\n\n3) **Adopt an intake-and-triage loop with explicit decision rules.**  \n   Each cycle should: (a) add sources → (b) classify into matrix → (c) write structured notes → (d) extract 1–3 “claims/results” → (e) tag what needs verification.\n\n4) **Close the validation loop with at least 1 runnable computational example.**  \n   Not to “do numerics for everything,” but to demonstrate the pipeline can produce: code → run → output artifact (plots/logs) → short interpretation note → reproducibility metadata.\n\n5) **Make failures actionable: introduce a postmortem checklist + reliability guardrails.**  \n   Add a preflight checklist (content length thresholds, file creation confirmation, retry policy) and require each cycle to end with at least one persisted artifact update.\n\n---\n\n## 4) URGENT goals to create (to close deliverables gaps)\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Create a minimal runnable computational skeleton in /outputs (or project root): a Python script/notebook + requirements (or pyproject) + one toy experiment demonstrating a key survey concept, since the deliverables audit shows only 3 markdown files (README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md) and 0 execution results.\",\n    \"agentType\": \"code_creation\",\n    \"priority\": 0.95,\n    \"urgency\": \"high\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Current artifacts are non-executable; without runnable code, the system cannot produce validation outputs or reproducibility signals.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Execute the created computational skeleton end-to-end and persist execution outputs (logs/plots/results) into /outputs, because the deliverables audit reports 0 test/execution results.\",\n    \"agentType\": \"code_execution\",\n    \"priority\": 0.95,\n    \"urgency\": \"high\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Closes the medium-severity missing_validation gap by generating tangible run artifacts and proving the pipeline works.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Create /outputs/roadmap_scope_success_criteria.md defining 'comprehensive survey v1' (scope boundaries, subtopic list, prioritization policy, and Definition of Done), since there are currently no dedicated planning documents in the audit.\",\n    \"agentType\": \"document_creation\",\n    \"priority\": 0.9,\n    \"urgency\": \"high\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Unblocks goal_2 with a persistent artifact and prevents drift by making success measurable.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Create /outputs/references.bib with an initial seed set + documented bib workflow (fields required, tagging, deduplication), because no bibliography artifact exists in the current deliverables set (only README.md/first_artifact.md/research_template.md).\",\n    \"agentType\": \"document_creation\",\n    \"priority\": 0.9,\n    \"urgency\": \"high\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Enables scalable intake and citation tracking; directly addresses goal_3 and prevents untraceable source usage.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"description\": \"Create /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or .md table) mapping subdomains -> core sources -> status (unread/skim/read/notes/verified) and define the 'read next' decision rule, since no analysis outputs or matrix artifacts exist yet.\",\n    \"agentType\": \"document_creation\",\n    \"priority\": 0.85,\n    \"urgency\": \"high\",\n    \"rationale\": \"Implements goal_4 as a tangible control instrument; ensures coherent progress and measurable coverage.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nIf you want, I can also propose a **20-cycle timeline** that sequences these (cycles 1–5 pipeline, 6–20 survey+matrix expansion+validation cadence) while keeping the artifact count growing every cycle.",
