## Cognitive Work Analysis

1) Quality Assessment (1–10)
- Depth: 8 — detailed reasoning and examples provided
- Novelty: 7 — exploring fresh territory beyond tracked themes
- Coherence: 6 — focused but somewhat repetitive

2) Dominant Themes
- Exploring territory beyond standard tracked themes
- No single dominant pattern detected

3) Intellectual Progress
Consistent depth maintained across the period, though limited explicit cross-referencing between ideas.

4) Gaps & Blind Spots
No major blind spots detected. Exploration appears well-distributed across multiple conceptual areas.

5) Standout Insights (breakthrough potential)
- 5: critic — Assumption: Mathematical models (e.g., differential equations, statistical models) accurately capture real-world phenomena. Critical limitation: they rely on idealizations, simplified assumptions, and...
- 3: curiosity — Insight: Connecting microscopic structure to macroscopic behavior often reduces complex problems to a few key invariants (e.g., conserved quantities or low-order moments), dramatically simplifying ana...
- 4: analyst — Probability formalizes uncertainty by assigning measures to events and using expectation as the linear summary of average outcomes; however, expectation alone can be misleading because variance and ta...
- 6: curiosity — Insight: Well-posedness requires existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on data—without stability (small input → small output changes) an ostensibly solvable problem can be useless for analy...
- 1: analyst — The derivative at x is the slope of the best local linear predictor of a function’s values: taking an infinitesimal neighborhood and minimizing mean-squared error yields the tangent line. This connect...

## Goal Portfolio Evaluation

## 1) Top 5 Priority Goals (immediate focus)
1. **goal_2** — roadmap + scope/success criteria (unblocks “comprehensive” definition).
2. **goal_3** — bibliography workflow + seed BibTeX (enables scalable intake).
3. **goal_4** — coverage matrix + eval loop (prevents drift; guides next work).
4. **goal_guided_research_1766538132773** — actual literature surveying (core value; should follow 2–4).
5. **goal_5** — resolve the blocking/DoD failure before re-attempting research intake.

## 2) Goals to Merge (overlap/redundancy)
- Merge **goal_5** into **goal_guided_research_1766538132773** (goal_5 is essentially a failed/blocked instance of the same objective).

## 3) Goals to Archive
- **Archive: goal_1** (completed).
- **Archive: goal_guided_analysis_1766538132774** (completed).
- **Archive: goal_guided_code_execution_1766538132775** (completed).
- **Archive: goal_5** (redundant after merging into goal_guided_research_1766538132773).

## 4) Missing Directions (not represented)
- Domain/subtopic prioritization policy (what gets covered first, and why).
- Quality bar for “acceptable source note” (minimum proof/example requirements, cross-linking rules).
- Versioning/reproducibility standards for computations (env, lockfiles) tied to future code artifacts.
- A concrete “intake queue” process (where sources come from; how to triage).

## 5) Pursuit Strategy (tight sequence)
1. Finish **goal_2**: define “comprehensive v1” + per-domain targets.
2. Finish **goal_3**: finalize taxonomy + intake checklist + seed **/outputs/references.bib**.
3. Finish **goal_4**: build coverage matrix and decision rules for what to read next.
4. Execute **goal_guided_research_1766538132773** using the template/workflow; update matrix + bib continuously.
5. Treat **goal_5** only as a postmortem note inside the merged research goal (document the DoD/field failure and the prevention check in the intake checklist).

### Prioritized Goals

- **goal_guided_research_1766538132773**: Comprehensively survey the modern and classical literature across the target domains (algebra, calculus, geometry, probability, statistics, discrete math, and mathematical modeling). Collect seminal papers, textbooks, survey articles, key theorems, canonical examples, and open problems. Prioritize sources that include proofs, worked examples, and datasets or simulation examples.
- **goal_1**: Goal ID: goal_outputs_bootstrap_20251224_01 — Create tangible artifacts in /outputs/ to fix the deliverables audit showing 0 files created. Minimum v1: /outputs/README.md (artifact rules), /outputs/research_template.md (source-note template), and /outputs/first_artifact.md (one completed note using the template).
- **goal_2**: Goal ID: goal_research_roadmap_success_criteria_20251224_02 — Write /outputs/roadmap_v1.md defining scope, success criteria, timebox (20 cycles), and per-domain deliverable targets (texts, surveys, seminal papers, key theorems, open problems). Include an explicit definition of what 'comprehensive' means for v1.
- **goal_3**: Goal ID: goal_bibliography_system_pipeline_20251224_03 — Create /outputs/bibliography_system.md specifying a citation workflow (BibTeX/Zotero/Obsidian-compatible), tagging taxonomy, and a 'source intake' checklist. Produce an initial /outputs/references.bib with at least 5 seed sources relevant to the chosen domains.
- **goal_4**: Goal ID: goal_coverage_matrix_eval_loop_20251224_04 — Create /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or .md table) tracking domains × subtopics × artifact types and /outputs/eval_loop.md defining a 5-cycle review cadence, metrics (artifact count, cross-links, coverage gaps), and decision rules for what to pursue next.

**Sample Insights:**
1. Well-posedness should be stated as a property of the parameter-to-solution map \mu\mapsto u(\mu), not just pointwise existence/uniqueness; continuity/differentiability/analyticity are central because they enable continuation, optimization gradients, and reduced-order surrogates....
2. Uniform-in-\mu a priori inequalities (coercivity, monotonicity, inf-sup, dissipativity, compactness) are the structural backbone: if they persist, stability and numerics are robust; if they degrade, one should expect boundary layers, stiffness, loss of regularity, nonuniqueness, and bifurcation-like...
3. The same energy/monotonicity estimate can simultaneously power existence proofs, stability/uniqueness arguments, and discretization error bounds—linking functional analysis directly to solver design and certified computation....

**Sample Findings:**
1. Across the analytical, practical, and historical perspectives, the unifying move is to treat a parametrized model not as many separate problems but as a single operator equation on a product space: find u(\mu) such that F(u,\mu)=0 between appropriate...

## Strategic Decisions

## 1) Top 5 goals to prioritize (by goal ID)

1) **goal_2 — roadmap + scope/success criteria**  
   *Rationale:* “Comprehensive survey” is currently undefined. This goal unblocks every downstream decision (what to read first, what “done” means, how to evaluate coverage).

2) **goal_3 — bibliography workflow + seed BibTeX**  
   *Rationale:* There is no scalable intake mechanism yet. A working BibTeX + triage workflow prevents repeated ad‑hoc source handling and enables reproducible citation tracking.

3) **goal_4 — coverage matrix + evaluation loop**  
   *Rationale:* Prevents drift. Converts “we read a lot” into measurable coverage across subtopics + a clear “read next” decision rule.

4) **goal_guided_research_1766538132773 — execute actual literature surveying**  
   *Rationale:* This is the core value delivery. It should run *after* goals 2–4 so outputs are structured, auditable, and cumulative.

5) **goal_5 — (merge into goal_guided_research_1766538132773)**  
   *Rationale:* It’s redundant and represents a prior blocked attempt. Keep it as a postmortem/checklist item inside the main research goal (especially the “No content received” failure mode).

---

## 2) Key insights (most important observations)

1) **Deliverables are still thin and non-validating.**  
   Audit shows **3 files created** (all in `/outputs/`: `README.md`, `first_artifact.md`, `research_template.md`) and **0 tests/execution results**. This fixes “zero artifacts” but not “proof of working pipeline.”

2) **There’s a persistent “think > ship” failure mode.**  
   The system produces conceptual insights (well-posedness, stability, expectation pitfalls), but those aren’t yet converted into persistent assets: bibliography, coverage map, structured notes, or runnable experiments.

3) **The next bottleneck is governance, not intelligence.**  
   The analysis indicates good depth/novelty, but coherence/repeat risk remains because scope, prioritization, and evaluation are not operationalized.

4) **Reliability issues must be designed around (“No content received”).**  
   One agent reported `Error: No content received...` which implies the workflow needs checkpoints, retries, and “partial-save” behavior to avoid losing cycles.

5) **There is an emerging unifying backbone worth centering:**  
   Parameter-to-solution maps + uniform a priori estimates link existence/uniqueness/stability to numerics and experiments. That’s a strong organizing spine for the survey—if we encode it into the scope/matrix.

---

## 3) Strategic directives (next ~20 cycles)

1) **Convert “comprehensive” into a v1 contract (scope + acceptance tests).**  
   Define: domains/subdomains, target number of sources per subdomain, what counts as “covered,” and what artifacts must exist at v1 (e.g., BibTeX size, matrix completeness, note quality bar).

2) **Stand up the minimum reproducible research pipeline (MRRP).**  
   Concretely: standardized note template (already started), BibTeX file, coverage matrix, and a folder convention. Add a “save early, save often” rule and periodic snapshots.

3) **Adopt an intake-and-triage loop with explicit decision rules.**  
   Each cycle should: (a) add sources → (b) classify into matrix → (c) write structured notes → (d) extract 1–3 “claims/results” → (e) tag what needs verification.

4) **Close the validation loop with at least 1 runnable computational example.**  
   Not to “do numerics for everything,” but to demonstrate the pipeline can produce: code → run → output artifact (plots/logs) → short interpretation note → reproducibility metadata.

5) **Make failures actionable: introduce a postmortem checklist + reliability guardrails.**  
   Add a preflight checklist (content length thresholds, file creation confirmation, retry policy) and require each cycle to end with at least one persisted artifact update.

## 4) URGENT goals to create (to close deliverables gaps)

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Create a minimal runnable computational skeleton in /outputs (or project root): a Python script/notebook + requirements (or pyproject) + one toy experiment demonstrating a key survey concept, since the deliverables audit shows only 3 markdown files (README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md) and 0 execution results.",
    "agentType": "code_creation",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Current artifacts are non-executable; without runnable code, the system cannot produce validation outputs or reproducibility signals."
  },
  {
    "description": "Execute the created computational skeleton end-to-end and persist execution outputs (logs/plots/results) into /outputs, because the deliverables audit reports 0 test/execution results.",
    "agentType": "code_execution",
    "priority": 0.95,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Closes the medium-severity missing_validation gap by generating tangible run artifacts and proving the pipeline works."
  },
  {
    "description": "Create /outputs/roadmap_scope_success_criteria.md defining 'comprehensive survey v1' (scope boundaries, subtopic list, prioritization policy, and Definition of Done), since there are currently no dedicated planning documents in the audit.",
    "agentType": "document_creation",
    "priority": 0.9,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Unblocks goal_2 with a persistent artifact and prevents drift by making success measurable."
  },
  {
    "description": "Create /outputs/references.bib with an initial seed set + documented bib workflow (fields required, tagging, deduplication), because no bibliography artifact exists in the current deliverables set (only README.md/first_artifact.md/research_template.md).",
    "agentType": "document_creation",
    "priority": 0.9,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Enables scalable intake and citation tracking; directly addresses goal_3 and prevents untraceable source usage."
  },
  {
    "description": "Create /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or .md table) mapping subdomains -> core sources -> status (unread/skim/read/notes/verified) and define the 'read next' decision rule, since no analysis outputs or matrix artifacts exist yet.",
    "agentType": "document_creation",
    "priority": 0.85,
    "urgency": "high",
    "rationale": "Implements goal_4 as a tangible control instrument; ensures coherent progress and measurable coverage."
  }
]
```

If you want, I can also propose a **20-cycle timeline** that sequences these (cycles 1–5 pipeline, 6–20 survey+matrix expansion+validation cadence) while keeping the artifact count growing every cycle.
