  "missionDescription": "Execute the notebook end-to-end in a reproducible environment: run symbolic derivations, run numeric parameter sweeps, generate plots, produce CSV tables of results, run unit tests, and collect run logs. For the derivative-as-local-MSE experiment, run across multiple smooth test functions and neighborhood sizes; for parametrized-model experiment, run across parameter grid and compute variance and reconstruction errors; for cycle-1 diagnostics re-run the specified divergence metrics.",
  "missionSuccessCriteria": [
    "Includes executable code (Python script or Jupyter notebook) with clear documentation, parameters, and example outputs. Code should be runnable and produce expected results.",
    "Includes data visualizations or figures (PNG, SVG, or described in detail) that effectively communicate findings."
