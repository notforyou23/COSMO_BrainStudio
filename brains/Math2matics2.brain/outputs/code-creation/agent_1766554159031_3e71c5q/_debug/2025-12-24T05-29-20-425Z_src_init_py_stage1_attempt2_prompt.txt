You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Fix the syntax error; add a deterministic CLI entrypoint (e.g., python -m src.goal_33_toy_experiment --seed 0 --out ./outputs/goal_33/); ensure it writes results.json + figure.png with a fixed schema and exits nonzero on failure.
Project: generated_cli_tool_1766554159244 (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: src/__init__.py
- Purpose: Marks `src` as a Python package to ensure `python -m src.goal_33_toy_experiment` works reliably across environments.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/goal_33_toy_experiment.py: Implements a deterministic, seedable CLI experiment runnable via `python -m src.goal_33_toy_experiment` that fixes existing syntax issues, runs the toy experiment, saves `results.json` and `figure.png` with a fixed schema, and exits nonzero on any failure.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Marks `src` as a Python package to ensure `python -m src.goal_33_toy_experiment` works reliably across environments.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/__init__.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/__init__.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/__init__.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
