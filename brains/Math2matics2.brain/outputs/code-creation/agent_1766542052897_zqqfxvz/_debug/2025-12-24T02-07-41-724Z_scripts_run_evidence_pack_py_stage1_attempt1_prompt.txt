You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a single-cycle "evidence pack": run the pipeline end-to-end, commit /outputs/results.json, /outputs/figure.png, /outputs/run.log, /outputs/test.log, and add a short /outputs/STATUS.md summarizing what ran, where outputs are, and what passed.
Project: single-cycle "evidence pack": run the pipeline end-to-end, commit /outputs/results.json, /outputs/figure.png, /outputs/run.log, /outputs/test.log, and add a short /outputs/STATUS.md summarizing what ran, where outputs are, and what passed. (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/run_evidence_pack.py
- Purpose: CLI entrypoint to run the pipeline end-to-end and write all evidence pack artifacts into the outputs directory.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/pipeline.py: End-to-end single-cycle pipeline that generates outputs/results.json, outputs/figure.png, outputs/run.log, outputs/test.log, and outputs/STATUS.md deterministically.
- src/plotting.py: Plotting helpers to render a canonical figure.png from the pipeline results with consistent styling and deterministic output.
- src/io_utils.py: Utility functions for structured logging, JSON read/write, directory management, and reproducible timestamp/run metadata capture.
- tests/test_pipeline_smoke.py: Smoke test that runs the pipeline and asserts that all required output artifacts are created and minimally valid.

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: CLI entrypoint to run the pipeline end-to-end and write all evidence pack artifacts into the outputs directory.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/run_evidence_pack.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/run_evidence_pack.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/run_evidence_pack.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
