You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a single CLI entrypoint (e.g., src/run.py) that (1) sets all RNG seeds, (2) runs the canonical pipeline, (3) writes ./outputs/results.json and ./outputs/figure.png with a fixed schema, and (4) writes ./outputs/hashes.json containing SHA256 of each artifact for determinism verification.
Project: single CLI entrypoint (e.g., src/run.py) that (1) sets all RNG seeds, (2) runs the canonical pipeline, (3) writes ./outputs/results.json and ./outputs/figure.png with a fixed schema, and (4) writes ./outputs/hashes.json containing SHA256 of each artifact for determinism verification. (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: pyproject.toml
- Purpose: Project configuration defining dependencies, test tooling, and a console script entry (optional) to invoke src/run.py as the single CLI entrypoint.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/run.py: Single deterministic CLI entrypoint that sets all RNG seeds, runs the canonical pipeline, writes outputs/results.json and outputs/figure.png with fixed schema, and writes outputs/hashes.json with SHA256 hashes of each artifact.
- src/pipeline.py: Implements the canonical pipeline steps (data generation/loading, processing, metrics computation, and figure creation) as pure functions to support deterministic execution from the CLI.
- src/determinism.py: Utilities to set seeds across random/numpy/optional torch, enforce deterministic settings, and compute SHA256 hashes for produced artifacts.
- src/io_utils.py: Helpers for atomic output writing, JSON schema-stable serialization, and ensuring the outputs directory exists.

Key requirements:

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Project configuration defining dependencies, test tooling, and a console script entry (optional) to invoke src/run.py as the single CLI entrypoint.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('pyproject.toml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:pyproject.toml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside pyproject.toml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
