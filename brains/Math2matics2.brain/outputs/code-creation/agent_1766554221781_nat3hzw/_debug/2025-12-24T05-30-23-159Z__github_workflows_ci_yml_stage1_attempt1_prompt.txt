You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create scripts/run_pipeline.py that writes run_stamp.json + run.log to ./outputs, add tests/test_pipeline_artifacts.py that runs the entrypoint and asserts files exist + JSON schema keys, and wire it into CI.
Project: scripts/run_pipeline.py that writes run_stamp.json + run.log to ./outputs, add tests/test_pipeline_artifacts.py that runs the entrypoint and asserts files exist + JSON schema keys, and wire it into CI. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Purpose: GitHub Actions CI workflow that sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs pytest to enforce artifact generation and schema checks on every push and PR.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_pipeline.py: Entry-point script that executes a minimal reproducible pipeline run and always writes ./outputs/run_stamp.json and ./outputs/run.log with canonical metadata and logging.
- tests/test_pipeline_artifacts.py: Integration test that runs scripts/run_pipeline.py and asserts outputs/run_stamp.json and outputs/run.log exist and that the JSON contains the expected schema keys.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: GitHub Actions CI workflow that sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs pytest to enforce artifact generation and schema checks on every push and PR.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('.github/workflows/ci.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:.github/workflows/ci.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside .github/workflows/ci.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
