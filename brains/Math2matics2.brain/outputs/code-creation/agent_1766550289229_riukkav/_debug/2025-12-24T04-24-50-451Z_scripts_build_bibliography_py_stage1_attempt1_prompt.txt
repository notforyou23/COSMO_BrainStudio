You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create ./outputs/bibliography_system.md (workflow: required fields, tagging, dedup) and ./outputs/references.bib with 10–20 seed entries tagged by type (seminal/survey/textbook) and topic.
Project: ./outputs/bibliography_system.md (workflow: required fields, tagging, dedup) and ./outputs/references.bib with 10–20 seed entries tagged by type (seminal/survey/textbook) and topic. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/build_bibliography.py
- Purpose: Deterministic CLI script that loads seed reference data, enforces required fields and tagging rules, performs deduplication, and writes canonical outputs/bibliography_system.md and outputs/references.bib.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- data/seed_references.yaml: Seed bibliography dataset (10–20 entries) with required fields plus type tags (seminal/survey/textbook) and topic tags used by the build script.
- outputs/bibliography_system.md: Canonical markdown specification of the bibliography workflow including required fields, tagging schema, deterministic ordering, and deduplication policy.
- outputs/references.bib: Canonical BibTeX bibliography generated from the seed dataset containing 10–20 tagged entries with deterministic formatting and ordering.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Deterministic CLI script that loads seed reference data, enforces required fields and tagging rules, performs deduplication, and writes canonical outputs/bibliography_system.md and outputs/references.bib.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/build_bibliography.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/build_bibliography.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/build_bibliography.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
