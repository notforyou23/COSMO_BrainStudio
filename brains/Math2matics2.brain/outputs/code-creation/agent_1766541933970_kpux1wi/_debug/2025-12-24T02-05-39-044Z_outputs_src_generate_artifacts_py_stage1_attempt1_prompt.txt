You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a minimal runnable computational skeleton (e.g., /outputs/src/ + a single runnable script) that produces at least one deterministic artifact saved into /outputs/ (e.g., a plot .png and a results .json). This is required because current deliverables are only markdown files (README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md) and there are 0 execution outputs.
Project: minimal runnable computational skeleton (e.g., /outputs/src/ + a single runnable (json configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/src/generate_artifacts.py
- Purpose: Single runnable Python script that deterministically generates a small synthetic dataset, computes summary statistics, saves a results JSON and a PNG plot into outputs/, and logs run metadata.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/src/requirements.txt: Pinned minimal Python dependencies needed to run the artifact-generation script reproducibly.
- outputs/src/README.md: Execution documentation explaining how to install dependencies and run the script to produce deterministic artifacts in outputs/.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Single runnable Python script that deterministically generates a small synthetic dataset, computes summary statistics, saves a results JSON and a PNG plot into outputs/, and logs run metadata.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/src/generate_artifacts.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/src/generate_artifacts.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/src/generate_artifacts.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
