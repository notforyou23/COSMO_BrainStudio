You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a toy experiment (e.g., simulate heavy-tailed data; compare sample mean vs median-of-means error), save ./outputs/results.json and ./outputs/mom_vs_mean.png, and record run metadata in a log file.
Project: generated_script_1766550130997 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/simulate.py
- Purpose: Provides heavy-tailed data generators (e.g., Student-t/Pareto mixtures) and trial execution utilities returning structured results for saving and plotting.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_experiment.py: CLI script that simulates heavy-tailed data, compares sample mean vs median-of-means errors over repeated trials, writes outputs/results.json and outputs/mom_vs_mean.png, and logs run metadata.
- src/estimators.py: Implements robust estimators including sample mean and median-of-means with configurable block counts and deterministic RNG handling.
- src/plotting.py: Creates the mom_vs_mean.png figure from experiment results with consistent styling and labeled comparisons.
- src/io_utils.py: Handles creation of outputs directory, atomic JSON saving to outputs/results.json, and simple append-only run logging to a log file.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provides heavy-tailed data generators (e.g., Student-t/Pareto mixtures) and trial execution utilities returning structured results for saving and plotting.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/simulate.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/simulate.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/simulate.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
