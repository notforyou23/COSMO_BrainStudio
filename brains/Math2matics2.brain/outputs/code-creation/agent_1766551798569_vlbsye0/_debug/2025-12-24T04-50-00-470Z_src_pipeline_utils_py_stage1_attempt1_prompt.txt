You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a deterministic pipeline entrypoint (e.g., scripts/run_pipeline.py) that writes ./outputs/results.json, ./outputs/figure.png, ./outputs/run_stamp.json, and ./outputs/logs/*.log with a stable schema and fixed random seeds; then link these artifacts from /outputs/roadmap_v1.md and the coverage matrix as the first completed deliverable.
Project: generated_script_1766551798929 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/pipeline/utils.py
- Purpose: Small deterministic utilities including hashing, environment capture, atomic writes, and seed initialization helpers.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_pipeline.py: Deterministic pipeline entrypoint that sets fixed seeds, runs the end-to-end workflow, and writes outputs/results.json, outputs/figure.png, outputs/run_stamp.json, and outputs/logs/*.log with stable schemas.
- src/pipeline/core.py: Core pipeline implementation providing deterministic data generation/processing, metrics computation, and artifact-writing functions used by the entrypoint.
- src/pipeline/logging_utils.py: Logging utilities that configure run-scoped file logging into outputs/logs with consistent formatting and reproducible metadata.
- src/pipeline/plotting.py: Plotting module that creates a deterministic matplotlib figure and saves it to outputs/figure.png with controlled style and rendering settings.

Key requirements:

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Small deterministic utilities including hashing, environment capture, atomic writes, and seed initialization helpers.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/pipeline/utils.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/pipeline/utils.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/pipeline/utils.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
