You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Fix the syntax error, add a deterministic seed parameter, ensure it writes a minimal results artifact (e.g., ./outputs/results.json), and add/adjust a unit test that imports and runs the module without error.
Project: generated_library_1766554221948 (json library)

Target file details:
- Path: src/repro_json_pipeline.py
- Purpose: Implements a reproducible JSON-producing experiment pipeline with a deterministic seed parameter and writes a minimal outputs/results.json artifact while fixing any prior syntax issues.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/__init__.py: Defines the src package exports to allow clean importing of the reproducible JSON pipeline module in tests and downstream code.
- tests/test_repro_json_pipeline_import_and_run.py: Unit test that imports the module and runs the pipeline with a fixed seed to ensure no syntax/import errors and that outputs/results.json is created deterministically.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Implements a reproducible JSON-producing experiment pipeline with a deterministic seed parameter and writes a minimal outputs/results.json artifact while fixing any prior syntax issues.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/repro_json_pipeline.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/repro_json_pipeline.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/repro_json_pipeline.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
