You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Generate two output artifacts for the Mathematics domain: (1) /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or an equivalent markdown table) enumerating domains × subtopics × artifact types with status fields and cross-link placeholders, and (2) /outputs/eval_loop.md describing a 5-cycle review cadence, metrics to track (artifact count, cross-links, uncovered cells), and concrete decision rules for what to create next. The code agent should create structured, machine-readable CSV and a human-readable markdown policy document so they can be inspected, versioned, and consumed by downstream agents or tooling.
Project: next. The code agent should create structured, machine-readable CSV and a human-readable markdown policy document so they can be inspected, versioned, and consumed by downstream agents or (python cli_tool)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_generation.py
- Purpose: Automated tests validating that the CLI generates the required outputs with correct headers, row counts, and stable content for inspection and downstream consumption.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/math_coverage_cli.py: Python CLI tool that generates /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (and optional markdown table) plus /outputs/eval_loop.md for the Mathematics domain with deterministic, machine-readable and human-readable artifacts.
- src/math_taxonomy.py: Defines the Mathematics domain taxonomy (domains, subtopics, artifact types, and default status/cross-link placeholders) used to populate the coverage matrix.
- src/renderers.py: Rendering utilities to serialize the coverage matrix to CSV and optionally to markdown, and to emit the evaluation loop markdown policy document.
- src/io_utils.py: Filesystem and deterministic output helpers to create output directories, write files atomically, and normalize line endings for stable diffs.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Automated tests validating that the CLI generates the required outputs with correct headers, row counts, and stable content for inspection and downstream consumption.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_generation.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_generation.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_generation.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
