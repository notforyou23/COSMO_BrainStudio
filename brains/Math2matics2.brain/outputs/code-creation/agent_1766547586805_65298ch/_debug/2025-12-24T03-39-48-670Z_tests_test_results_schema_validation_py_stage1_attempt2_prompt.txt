You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define a stable results schema (fields + version) for /outputs/results.json and enforce it in code + tests; pin randomness (seed) and plotting parameters to ensure figure determinism.
Project: generated_script_1766547587406 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_results_schema_validation.py
- Purpose: Pytest suite verifying results.json payloads validate against v1 schema and reject missing/incorrect fields while preserving schema_version behavior.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/results_schema.py: Defines the versioned results schema, provides runtime validation/coercion helpers, and exposes a single function to build a compliant /outputs/results.json payload.
- src/determinism.py: Implements seed pinning across Python/numpy/random/torch (if present) and centralizes deterministic matplotlib plotting defaults to ensure reproducible figures.
- src/results_io.py: Writes validated results.json and deterministic figure files to /outputs, embedding schema_version, run metadata, and content hashes for regression testing.
- src/run_pipeline.py: End-to-end runnable pipeline entrypoint that applies determinism settings, executes the experiment(s), generates deterministic plots, and emits a schema-compliant outputs/results.json.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pytest suite verifying results.json payloads validate against v1 schema and reject missing/incorrect fields while preserving schema_version behavior.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_results_schema_validation.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_results_schema_validation.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_results_schema_validation.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
