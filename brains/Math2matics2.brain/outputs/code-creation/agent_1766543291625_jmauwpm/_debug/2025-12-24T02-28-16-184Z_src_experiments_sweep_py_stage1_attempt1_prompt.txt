Mission summary: Refactor and modularize reusable code artifacts: 2025-12-24T02-18-55-749Z_src_experiments_io_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt, 2025-12-24T02-18-55-749Z_src_experiments_common_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt, io.py, 2025-12-24T02-18-55-749Z_src_experiments_plotting_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt, 2025-12-24T02-18-55-749Z_src_experiments_sweep_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt
Project: generated_script_1766543295127 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/experiments/sweep.py
- Purpose: Parameter sweep utilities for generating search spaces, running experiment grids, collecting results, and persisting sweep manifests.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/experiments/__init__.py: Package initializer that exposes the public API surface for reusable experiments utilities and maintains stable imports.
- src/experiments/common.py: Shared, dependency-light utilities for experiment configuration, seeding, metadata handling, and small helpers used across IO, sweeps, and plotting.
- src/experiments/io.py: Unified experiment IO layer for reading/writing configs, results, artifacts, and tabular data with consistent paths, formats, and safety checks.
- src/experiments/plotting.py: Reusable plotting helpers for experiment outputs (e.g., metrics curves, aggregated summaries) with a consistent style and optional Matplotlib/Seaborn integration.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Parameter sweep utilities for generating search spaces, running experiment grids, collecting results, and persisting sweep manifests.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/experiments/sweep.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/experiments/sweep.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/experiments/sweep.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
