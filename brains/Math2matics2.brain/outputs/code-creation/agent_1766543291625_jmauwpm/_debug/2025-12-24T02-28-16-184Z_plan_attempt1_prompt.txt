You are planning a python script implementation for the following mission:
Refactor and modularize reusable code artifacts: 2025-12-24T02-18-55-749Z_src_experiments_io_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt, 2025-12-24T02-18-55-749Z_src_experiments_common_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt, io.py, 2025-12-24T02-18-55-749Z_src_experiments_plotting_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt, 2025-12-24T02-18-55-749Z_src_experiments_sweep_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
Respond with VALID JSON only.
