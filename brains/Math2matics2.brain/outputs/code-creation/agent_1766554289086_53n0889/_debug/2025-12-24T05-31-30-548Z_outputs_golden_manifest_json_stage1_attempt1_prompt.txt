You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement/verify CI job that (1) fresh-clone installs deps, (2) runs `python scripts/run_pipeline.py`, (3) asserts required artifacts exist in `./outputs/` and are deterministic via checksum/golden-file comparison, and (4) gates merges on pass.
Project: generated_script_1766554289288 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/golden_manifest.json
- Purpose: Golden checksum manifest for required pipeline artifacts under outputs/ used by CI to enforce deterministic builds.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- .github/workflows/pipeline-ci.yml: GitHub Actions CI workflow that fresh-clones, installs dependencies, runs scripts/run_pipeline.py, validates required outputs via checksum/golden comparison, and gates merges on success.
- scripts/ci/validate_artifacts.py: Artifact validation script that asserts required files exist under outputs/ and verifies determinism by comparing computed checksums to a tracked golden manifest.
- scripts/ci/README.md: Documentation describing how the CI pipeline runs, which artifacts are required, how determinism is enforced, and how to update the golden manifest intentionally.

Key requirements:

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Golden checksum manifest for required pipeline artifacts under outputs/ used by CI to enforce deterministic builds.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/golden_manifest.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/golden_manifest.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/golden_manifest.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
