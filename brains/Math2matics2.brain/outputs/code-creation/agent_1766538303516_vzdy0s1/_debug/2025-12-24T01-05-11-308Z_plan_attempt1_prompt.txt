You are planning a python configuration implementation for the following mission:
Goal ID: goal_outputs_bootstrap_20251224_01 — Create tangible artifacts in /outputs/ to fix the deliverables audit showing 0 files created. Minimum v1: /outputs/README.md (artifact rules), /outputs/research_template.md (source-note template), and /outputs/first_artifact.md (one completed note using the template).

Relevant context:
- [AGENT: agent_1766538161484_b5yh91f] Cycle 1 consistency review (divergence 0.97):
Summary (high-level): The three branches are about differ

Explicit requirements:
- documentation

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
Respond with VALID JSON only.
