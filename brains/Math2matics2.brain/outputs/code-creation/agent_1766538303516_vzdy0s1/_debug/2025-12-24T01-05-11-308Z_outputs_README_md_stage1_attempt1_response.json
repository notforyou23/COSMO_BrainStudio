The deliverables audit checks for real files here; keep contents stable, specific, and reviewable.\n\n## 1) What counts as an artifact\nAn artifact is a file that:\n- is stored directly in `/outputs/` (not elsewhere),\n- has meaningful, non-placeholder content,\n- is understandable without external context,\n- can be reviewed for completeness (e.g., includes source, date, and status where applicable).\n\nExamples: research notes, templates, summaries, decision logs, exported datasets, diagrams (as images), or small scripts **only if** they are themselves the deliverable.\n\n## 2) File naming and organization\n- Put deliverables **at the top level** of `/outputs/` unless there is a clear need for subfolders.\n- Use lowercase with underscores: `research_template.md`, `first_artifact.md`.\n- Prefer stable names over timestamps. If multiple versions are required, suffix with `v1`, `v2`, etc.\n- Do not overwrite prior artifacts unless the goal explicitly requires replacement.\n\n## 3) Required metadata (for markdown artifacts)\nMarkdown artifacts should start with a small header block containing:\n- **Title**\n- **Created (YYYY-MM-DD)**\n- **Owner/Author**\n- **Purpose**\n- **Status**: `draft` | `in_review` | `final`\n- **Sources** (if any): citations or links\n- **Verification** (if applicable): what was checked and what remains unverified\n\n## 4) Source handling and citations\n- Every factual claim that depends on external information should have a **source**.\n- Prefer primary sources; otherwise cite reputable secondary sources.\n- Use consistent citation style (e.g., inline links or a “Sources” section with numbered references).\n- When uncertain, mark the claim as **unverified** rather than asserting it as fact.\n\n## 5) Quality bar (no placeholders)\nArtifacts must **not** contain:\n- “TODO”, “TBD”, “lorem ipsum”, or empty sections meant to be filled later,\n- vague statements without specifics when specifics are expected (e.g., “add citations later”),\n- dead links presented as sources (if a link is required, include access date or mirror notes).\n\nIf something cannot be completed, write a short explanation and mark the status accordingly (e.g., `draft`)—but still provide a useful, reviewable artifact.\n\n## 6) Reproducibility & traceability\nWhere relevant, include:\n- assumptions,\n- steps taken,\n- inputs/outputs,\n- and enough detail for another person to reproduce the result.\n\nFor research notes, use the standardized template in `research_template.md` (created separately) and include verification status per claim.\n\n## 7) Allowed formats\n- Preferred: `.md` (Markdown) for human review.\n- Also acceptable: `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.png`, `.pdf` when appropriate.\n- Avoid binary formats unless necessary; if used, include a short `.md` companion note describing how it was produced.\n\n## 8) Review checklist (quick)\nBefore considering an artifact “done”, confirm:\n- [ ] File is in `/outputs/` and has a stable name\n- [ ] Purpose and status are stated\n- [ ] Claims are sourced or explicitly marked unverified\n- [ ] No placeholders or empty sections\n- [ ] Content is understandable on its own\n\n--- \nThis README defines the conventions for artifacts in `/outputs/` to ensure deliverables audits detect real, reviewable work products.\"\"\"\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/README.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))\n",
