You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Goal ID: goal_outputs_bootstrap_20251224_01 — Create tangible artifacts in /outputs/ to fix the deliverables audit showing 0 files created. Minimum v1: /outputs/README.md (artifact rules), /outputs/research_template.md (source-note template), and /outputs/first_artifact.md (one completed note using the template).
Project: tangible artifacts in /outputs/ to fix the deliverables audit showing 0 files created. Minimum v1: /outputs/README.md (artifact rules), /outputs/research_template.md (source-note template), and /outputs/first_artifact.md (one completed note using the template). (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/research_template.md
- Purpose: Provides a reusable source-note template for capturing research with citations, claims, and verification status.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/README.md: Documents the artifact rules and conventions for files placed in /outputs to satisfy deliverables audits.
- outputs/first_artifact.md: Contains one completed research note using the template to demonstrate the expected format and completeness.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provides a reusable source-note template for capturing research with citations, claims, and verification status.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/research_template.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/research_template.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/research_template.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
