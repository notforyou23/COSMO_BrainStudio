## 6) Claims derived from this source
Each claim must be atomic (one idea), testable, and anchored to the extracted notes above.
For each claim, include confidence and verification status.

### Claim table

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 |  |  | quote | low/med/high | unverified/partially verified/verified/contradicted |  |
| C2 |  |  | paraphrase | low/med/high | unverified/partially verified/verified/contradicted |  |

Verification status definitions:
- unverified: only this source checked
- partially verified: checked against at least one additional independent source but not fully resolved
- verified: checked against multiple sources or reproducible evidence; no material conflicts found
- contradicted: credible conflict found; note conflicting sources in Section 8
