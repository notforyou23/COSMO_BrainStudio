You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a single utility for output paths (e.g., `OUTPUT_DIR = Path(os.getenv('OUTPUT_DIR', './outputs'))`) used everywhere; ensure directories are created and all writers use this path (never `/outputs`).
Project: generated_script_1766547793162 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/writers/__init__.py
- Purpose: Package initializer for writers that centralizes shared output directory behavior by re-exporting output path utilities for consistent use.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/utils/output_paths.py: Defines a single portable OUTPUT_DIR (from env var with safe default), helper functions to resolve/create output subdirectories, and path-joining utilities used across the project.
- src/run_pipeline.py: Main pipeline entrypoint updated to import and use OUTPUT_DIR utilities for all output artifacts, ensuring directories are created and avoiding any hard-coded /outputs paths.
- src/writers/artifact_writers.py: All artifact writer implementations updated so every file write resolves through OUTPUT_DIR helpers and pre-creates required directories rather than writing to /outputs or ad-hoc paths.
- src/config.py: Central configuration module updated to reference OUTPUT_DIR from the shared utility and to remove/avoid any legacy default of /outputs.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Package initializer for writers that centralizes shared output directory behavior by re-exporting output path utilities for consistent use.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/writers/__init__.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/writers/__init__.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/writers/__init__.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
