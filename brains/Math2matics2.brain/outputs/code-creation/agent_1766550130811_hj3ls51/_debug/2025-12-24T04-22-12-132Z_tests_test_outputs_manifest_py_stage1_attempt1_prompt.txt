You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create ./outputs/index.md that lists every expected artifact (roadmap, bib, coverage matrix, results.json, figure.png, test logs) and update scripts/run_pipeline.py to regenerate them deterministically; add tests that assert the manifest-listed files exist.
Project: ./outputs/index.md that lists every expected artifact (roadmap, bib, coverage matrix, results.json, figure.png, test logs) and update (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_outputs_manifest.py
- Purpose: End-to-end test that runs the pipeline and asserts every file listed in outputs/index.md exists (and is reproducibly generated) for CI/CD gating.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_pipeline.py: Deterministic, CLI-driven pipeline entrypoint that regenerates all expected artifacts (including outputs/index.md) with stable schemas/formats and optional CI-friendly flags.
- src/artifacts.py: Artifact generation utilities that write roadmap, bibliography, coverage matrix, results.json, figure.png, and test logs deterministically to a target output directory.
- src/manifest.py: Manifest management module that defines the canonical artifact list, renders outputs/index.md, and parses it for test assertions.
- outputs/index.md: Artifact manifest markdown that lists every expected pipeline output file and serves as the canonical checklist for CI tests.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: End-to-end test that runs the pipeline and asserts every file listed in outputs/index.md exists (and is reproducibly generated) for CI/CD gating.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_outputs_manifest.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_outputs_manifest.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_outputs_manifest.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
