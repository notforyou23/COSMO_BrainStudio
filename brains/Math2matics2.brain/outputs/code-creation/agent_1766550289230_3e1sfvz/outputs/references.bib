% references.bib — seed bibliography (v1)
% Dedup/check routine (v1 checklist):
% 1) Canonicalize: trim whitespace; collapse internal spaces; normalize dashes; Title Case titles only if required by your style.
% 2) Prefer DOI over URL; if both exist, keep both (URL as resolver/landing page).
% 3) De-dup heuristic: (author/editor + year + title) OR (doi) OR (isbn) match.
% 4) Check for near-duplicates: same DOI with different citekey; same title with minor punctuation.
% 5) Enforce tags via `keywords = {tag1;tag2;...}` (semicolon-delimited, lowercase).
% 6) Audit required fields by entry type (see bibliography_system.md).
