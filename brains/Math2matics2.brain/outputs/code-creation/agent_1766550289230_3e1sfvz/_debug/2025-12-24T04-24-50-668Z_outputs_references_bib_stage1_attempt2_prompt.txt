Mission summary: Create ./outputs/bibliography_system.md documenting required BibTeX fields and tagging conventions; add ./outputs/references.bib with ~10–20 seed entries and a brief dedup/check routine (even a manual checklist is fine for v1).
Project: ./outputs/bibliography_system.md documenting required BibTeX fields and tagging conventions; add ./outputs/references.bib with ~10–20 seed entries and a brief dedup/check routine (even a manual checklist is fine for v1). (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/references.bib
- Purpose: Provides 10–20 seed BibTeX entries following the documented schema and tags to bootstrap the bibliography.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/bibliography_system.md: Documents the required BibTeX fields by entry type, canonicalization rules, and tagging conventions for a deterministic bibliography workflow.
- src/bib_dedup_check.py: Implements a CLI routine to parse references.bib, normalize keys/fields, detect likely duplicates, and emit a brief checklist-style report for v1.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provides 10–20 seed BibTeX entries following the documented schema and tags to bootstrap the bibliography.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/references.bib')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/references.bib')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/references.bib.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
