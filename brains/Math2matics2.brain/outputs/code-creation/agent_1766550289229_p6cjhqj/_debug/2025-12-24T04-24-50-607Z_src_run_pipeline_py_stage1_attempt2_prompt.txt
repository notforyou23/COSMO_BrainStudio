Mission summary: Treat 'outputs-first' as the immediate milestone: (1) runnable pipeline + captured logs/results, then (2) roadmap, (3) bibliography system + seed .bib, (4) coverage matrix; add a checklist in ./outputs/index.md.
Project: generated_script_1766550289431 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/run_pipeline.py
- Purpose: Runnable outputs-first pipeline CLI that generates captured logs/results, roadmap, bibliography system with seed .bib, coverage matrix, and writes a checklist to outputs/index.md.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/pipeline/__init__.py: Package initializer for the documentation-and-research pipeline modules.
- src/pipeline/io_utils.py: Filesystem, timestamping, and atomic-write helpers used by the pipeline to ensure reproducible outputs and stable paths.
- src/pipeline/bibliography.py: Bibliography subsystem that validates and normalizes BibTeX, maintains a seed references.bib, and produces a bibliography summary artifact.
- src/pipeline/roadmap.py: Roadmap generator that produces a structured roadmap markdown artifact derived from pipeline context and configured milestones.

Key requirements:

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Runnable outputs-first pipeline CLI that generates captured logs/results, roadmap, bibliography system with seed .bib, coverage matrix, and writes a checklist to outputs/index.md.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/run_pipeline.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/run_pipeline.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/run_pipeline.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
