You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Repair the syntax error, add deterministic seeding, and ensure the toy experiment writes canonical artifacts (e.g., results.json, figure.png if applicable, plus run_stamp.json/run.log) under ./outputs/; then wire it into the pipeline entrypoint.
Project: generated_script_1766551798758 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Purpose: Runs CI on push/pull_request to execute the pipeline, verify canonical artifacts are created, and fail fast on reproducibility regressions.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/pipeline/__init__.py: Defines the pipeline package and exposes the main entrypoint used by the project to run experiments end-to-end.
- src/pipeline/entrypoint.py: Implements the pipeline entrypoint that runs the toy experiment with deterministic seeding and writes canonical artifacts under outputs/.
- src/pipeline/artifacts.py: Provides reusable helpers for canonical artifact creation (outputs dir, results.json, figure.png, run_stamp.json, run.log) and atomic writes.
- src/pipeline/seeding.py: Implements deterministic seeding across Python, NumPy, and (optionally) torch while recording the chosen seed for reproducibility.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Runs CI on push/pull_request to execute the pipeline, verify canonical artifacts are created, and fail fast on reproducibility regressions.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('.github/workflows/ci.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:.github/workflows/ci.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside .github/workflows/ci.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
