You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add a Makefile (or equivalent) target (e.g., make run && make test) that writes /outputs/run.log and /outputs/test.log on every cycle; update /outputs/eval_loop.md to require these logs as mandatory cycle artifacts.
Project: generated_script_1766543295064 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: Makefile
- Purpose: Defines run and test targets that always create /outputs/run.log and /outputs/test.log by executing the project run and test commands while teeing all output into the required log files each cycle.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/eval_loop.md: Documents the evaluation cycle procedure and explicitly marks outputs/run.log and outputs/test.log as mandatory artifacts required on every cycle.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines run and test targets that always create /outputs/run.log and /outputs/test.log by executing the project run and test commands while teeing all output into the required log files each cycle.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('Makefile')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:Makefile')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside Makefile.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
