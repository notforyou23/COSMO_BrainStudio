You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a minimal package layout + entrypoint (python -m <package>.run) that writes outputs/, then add tests/test_pipeline.py asserting files exist and (optionally) JSON schema keys match.
Project: minimal package layout + entrypoint (python -m <package>.run) that writes outputs/, then add tests/test_pipeline.py asserting files exist and (optionally) JSON schema keys match. (python library)

Target file details:
- Path: src/minipipe/run.py
- Purpose: Module entrypoint supporting python -m minipipe.run to execute the pipeline and exit with appropriate status for CI.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- pyproject.toml: Project configuration defining build system, package metadata, dependencies, and pytest settings for CI/CD-friendly execution.
- README.md: Documentation explaining how to run the entrypoint via python -m <package>.run and what artifacts are produced in outputs/.
- src/minipipe/__init__.py: Package initializer exposing the public API version and ensuring the package is importable.
- src/minipipe/pipeline.py: Core pipeline implementation that deterministically creates outputs/ and writes required artifact files including a JSON report.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Module entrypoint supporting python -m minipipe.run to execute the pipeline and exit with appropriate status for CI.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/minipipe/run.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/minipipe/run.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/minipipe/run.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
