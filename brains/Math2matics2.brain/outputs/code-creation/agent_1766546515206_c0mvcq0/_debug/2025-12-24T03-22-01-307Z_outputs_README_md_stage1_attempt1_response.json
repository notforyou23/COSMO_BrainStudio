Installs dependencies\n2. Runs the capture script\n3. Uploads the `outputs/` directory as an artifact (or at minimum the two canonical files)\n\nExample (generic shell step):\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install -r requirements.txt\npython scripts/run_tests_and_capture.py\n# then archive/upload: outputs/pytest_output.txt and outputs/run_metadata.json\n```\n\nRecommended: always upload artifacts even when tests fail, so the failing log and metadata are preserved.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Artifact details\n\n### `outputs/pytest_output.txt`\nA plain-text, line-for-line capture of the `pytest` run output, intended for:\n- Debugging failures (tracebacks, captured output, summary)\n- Auditing what was executed (plugins, collected tests, warnings)\n\nNotes:\n- The file is overwritten on each run.\n- Content is unstructured by design; use `run_metadata.json` for machine-readable fields.\n\n### `outputs/run_metadata.json`\nA JSON document intended for programmatic consumption (dashboards, trend tracking, CI summaries).\nWhile fields may evolve, it is expected to include (directly or nested):\n- `timestamp` / `started_at` and `finished_at` (or a `duration_seconds`)\n- `command` used to invoke pytest (or the capture script)\n- `cwd` / repository context\n- `exit_code` from pytest\n- paths to produced artifacts (e.g., `outputs/pytest_output.txt`)\n- CI indicators when available (e.g., `ci=true`, provider name, run/job identifiers)\n\nHow to use:\n- Prefer `exit_code` and timestamps for automation.\n- Use `pytest_output.txt` as the authoritative human-readable log referenced by the metadata.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Relationship to `outputs/index.md`\n\n`outputs/index.md` is the directory landing page. It should:\n- Link to this file (`outputs/README.md`) for instructions and artifact definitions\n- Summarize the canonical artifacts produced by the test-capture step\n\nWhen updating filenames or adding new canonical artifacts, update both `outputs/index.md` and this README accordingly.\"\"\"\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/README.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))",
