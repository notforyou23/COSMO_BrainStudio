You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Standardize output writing so the pipeline never attempts absolute `/outputs` (permission issues reported) and instead writes to repo-relative `./outputs/` with an optional environment variable override; add a smoke test asserting outputs are created in the canonical directory.
Project: generated_script_1766547691907 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/output_paths.py
- Purpose: Provides a single canonical function to resolve and create the pipeline output directory as repo-relative outputs/ by default with an optional environment variable override.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- tests/test_outputs_smoke.py: Smoke test that runs the pipeline (or its output-writing entrypoint) and asserts expected artifacts are created under the canonical repo-relative outputs/ directory when no override is set.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: CI workflow that installs dependencies and runs the test suite to ensure output directory behavior stays portable across environments.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provides a single canonical function to resolve and create the pipeline output directory as repo-relative outputs/ by default with an optional environment variable override.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/output_paths.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/output_paths.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/output_paths.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
