You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a canonical ./outputs/ directory at repo root (repo-relative, not absolute /outputs) and promote/copy the best existing artifacts from agent-specific output paths into it; then generate ./outputs/index.md and ./outputs/manifest.json listing files + sha256 so artifacts stop being fragmented.
Project: canonical ./outputs/ directory at repo root (repo-relative, not absolute /outputs) and promote/copy the best existing artifacts from agent-specific output paths into it; then generate ./outputs/index.md and ./outputs/manifest.json listing files + sha256 so artifacts stop being fragmented. (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/consolidate_outputs.py
- Purpose: CLI script that scans agent-specific output directories, promotes/copies the best artifacts into a canonical repo-relative outputs/ directory, and generates outputs/index.md and outputs/manifest.json with sha256 hashes.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/output_consolidator.py: Library module implementing artifact discovery, selection, copying, hashing, and index/manifest generation for standardized outputs handling.
- docs/outputs.md: Documentation describing the canonical outputs/ structure, how artifacts are selected and consolidated, and how to run the consolidation script.

Reference insights:
- [CONSOLIDATED] Robust “outputs” handling should be centralized and standardized—use a consistent, relative, run-scoped output directory with

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: CLI script that scans agent-specific output directories, promotes/copies the best artifacts into a canonical repo-relative outputs/ directory, and generates outputs/index.md and outputs/manifest.json with sha256 hashes.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/consolidate_outputs.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/consolidate_outputs.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/consolidate_outputs.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
