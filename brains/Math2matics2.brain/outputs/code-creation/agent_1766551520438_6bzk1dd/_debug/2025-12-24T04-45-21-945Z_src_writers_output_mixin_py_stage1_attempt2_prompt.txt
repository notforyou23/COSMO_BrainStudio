You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a single output-path helper utility (default OUTPUT_DIR = ./outputs, overrideable via environment variable) and refactor all writer modules to use this helper for determining output locations. Add a pytest that scans logs and produced artifact paths to assert that no absolute paths containing "/outputs" remain (only relative paths or paths derived from the helper are allowed). Ensure changes are well-documented and include a short usage note for the helper.
Project: generated_library_1766551520863 (python library)

Target file details:
- Path: src/writers/_output_mixin.py
- Purpose: Provides a small shared adapter/mixin used by writer modules to consistently resolve and create output locations via the central output-path helper.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/output_path.py: Implements a single output-path helper utility with default OUTPUT_DIR=./outputs overrideable via environment variable and provides safe join/ensure-dir functions for all writers.
- tests/test_no_absolute_outputs_paths.py: Pytest that scans logs and produced artifact paths to assert no absolute paths containing "/outputs" remain, allowing only relative paths or paths derived from the output-path helper.
- docs/output_path_helper.md: Documents the motivation, environment variable override, and includes a short usage note for the output-path helper.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provides a small shared adapter/mixin used by writer modules to consistently resolve and create output locations via the central output-path helper.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/writers/_output_mixin.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/writers/_output_mixin.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/writers/_output_mixin.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
