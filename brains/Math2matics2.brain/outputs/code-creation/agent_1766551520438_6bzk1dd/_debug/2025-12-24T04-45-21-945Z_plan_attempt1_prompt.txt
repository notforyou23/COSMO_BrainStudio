You are planning a python library implementation for the following mission:
Implement a single output-path helper utility (default OUTPUT_DIR = ./outputs, overrideable via environment variable) and refactor all writer modules to use this helper for determining output locations. Add a pytest that scans logs and produced artifact paths to assert that no absolute paths containing "/outputs" remain (only relative paths or paths derived from the helper are allowed). Ensure changes are well-documented and include a short usage note for the helper.

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
