  "missionDescription": "Implement a single output-path helper utility (default OUTPUT_DIR = ./outputs, overrideable via environment variable) and refactor all writer modules to use this helper for determining output locations. Add a pytest that scans logs and produced artifact paths to assert that no absolute paths containing \"/outputs\" remain (only relative paths or paths derived from the helper are allowed). Ensure changes are well-documented and include a short usage note for the helper.",
  "missionSuccessCriteria": [
    "A new helper module (e.g., output_path.py) exists that provides a single source-of-truth for OUTPUT_DIR, defaulting to './outputs' and allowing override via an environment variable (e.g., OUTPUT_DIR or APP_OUTPUT_DIR).",
    "All writer modules that previously constructed output paths directly are refactored to call the helper; there are no remaining direct references that hard-code '/outputs' as an absolute path.",
    "A pytest test is added that runs over logs/artifact metadata and asserts no occurrence of absolute paths containing '/outputs' (test should pass on CI with default settings).",
    "Documentation or a short README note is added explaining how to override OUTPUT_DIR and how writers obtain paths from the helper."
