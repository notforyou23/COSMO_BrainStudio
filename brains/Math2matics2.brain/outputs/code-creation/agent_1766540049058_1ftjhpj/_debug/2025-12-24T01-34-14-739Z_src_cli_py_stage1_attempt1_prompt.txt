You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a minimal set of canonical /outputs artifacts (index + run evidence + at least one domain artifact stub) and run the pipeline once to generate concrete files; then re-attempt the blocked survey task with the new artifact workflow in place.
Project: minimal set of canonical /outputs artifacts (index + run evidence + at least one domain artifact stub) and run the pipeline once to generate concrete files; then re-attempt the blocked survey task with the new artifact workflow in place. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/cli.py
- Purpose: Defines a command-line interface to run the pipeline once, generate concrete files, and trigger the survey retry step.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/pipeline.py: Implements a runnable pipeline that creates canonical /outputs artifacts (index, run evidence, and a domain artifact stub) and re-attempts the survey task using the new artifact workflow.
- src/artifacts.py: Provides artifact models and writers for the outputs index, run evidence, and domain artifact stub with deterministic paths and metadata.
- src/survey_retry.py: Contains the blocked survey task re-attempt logic wired to read/write the canonical artifacts and record results into run evidence.
- outputs/.gitkeep: Ensures the canonical outputs directory exists in version control for CI/CD runs.

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines a command-line interface to run the pipeline once, generate concrete files, and trigger the survey retry step.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/cli.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/cli.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/cli.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
