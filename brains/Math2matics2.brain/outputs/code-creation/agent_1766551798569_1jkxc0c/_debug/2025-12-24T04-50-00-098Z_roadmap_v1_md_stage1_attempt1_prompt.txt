You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Run scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py and scripts/run_pipeline.py (or add them if missing), redirect outputs into ./outputs/logs/, and ensure /outputs/index.md lists these logs plus run_stamp.json and results files; update roadmap_v1.md to link them as completed deliverables.
Project: generated_script_1766551798849 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: roadmap_v1.md
- Purpose: Project roadmap updated to mark the test-and-log runner and pipeline runner as completed deliverables with links to outputs/index.md and the generated logs/artifacts.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py: Runs the project's test command in a subprocess, captures stdout/stderr to a timestamped log under outputs/logs/, writes run_stamp.json, and updates outputs/index.md with links to the log and any results artifacts.
- scripts/run_pipeline.py: Executes the project pipeline entrypoint (configurable command), captures stdout/stderr to outputs/logs/ with a timestamped log, writes run_stamp.json, and updates outputs/index.md to list the run log and produced results files.
- scripts/_log_index_utils.py: Provides shared utilities for timestamped run stamps, creating outputs/logs directories, capturing subprocess output to log files, discovering results artifacts, and updating outputs/index.md deterministically.
- outputs/index.md: Central index documenting the latest and historical run logs in outputs/logs/ along with run_stamp.json and discovered results files for CI/CD traceability.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Project roadmap updated to mark the test-and-log runner and pipeline runner as completed deliverables with links to outputs/index.md and the generated logs/artifacts.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('roadmap_v1.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:roadmap_v1.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside roadmap_v1.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
