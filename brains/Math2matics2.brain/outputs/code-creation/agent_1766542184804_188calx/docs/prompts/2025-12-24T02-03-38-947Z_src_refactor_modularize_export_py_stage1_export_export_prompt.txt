Mission summary: Export the Stage 1 prompt used for the “export” branch of the refactor/modularize work as a reproducibility/auditing artifact.

Project: generated_script_1766542191957 (python script)

Target artifact:
- Path: docs/prompts/2025-12-24T02-03-38-947Z_src_refactor_modularize_export_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt
- Purpose: Store the exact prompt text that drove the “export” branch for Stage 1 so future reviewers can reproduce the agent’s instructions and compare outputs.
- Category: documentation

Context (do not implement here; documentation only):
- src/refactor_modularize/utils.py: reusable utilities extracted for multiple scripts
- scripts/generate_artifacts.py: CLI for generating/exporting artifacts deterministically
- README.md: setup + usage
- docs/prompts/*refactor*_prompt.txt: sibling prompt export for the refactor branch

Branch: export
Stage: Stage 1
Mode: export
Goal: Persist the Stage 1 export-branch prompt as plain text in the repository under docs/prompts/.

Operational constraints that were in effect:
- Write only to the target file under /mnt/data.
- Keep console output short and deterministic.
- No placeholders, no TODO markers in the produced artifact.
- Preserve exact wording and instruction ordering as much as possible to support auditing.

Export-branch Stage 1 instructions (verbatim intent):
1) Create a documentation artifact that captures the prompt used to generate/export Stage 1 deliverables for the export branch.
2) The artifact must live at:
   docs/prompts/2025-12-24T02-03-38-947Z_src_refactor_modularize_export_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt
3) The content must be self-contained and sufficiently specific that another engineer can:
   - understand what was being asked of the agent,
   - identify the project and target file,
   - see constraints and expected output behavior,
   - reproduce the same steps in a clean environment.
4) Do not include any secret material. Only include the prompt and relevant constraints.

Execution template used by the automation (for reference):
- Build the deliverable as a list named `chunks`, where each item is a multi-line string block.
- Join blocks with newlines to form `final_text`, ensuring a trailing newline.
- Write `final_text` to the target_path with UTF-8 encoding.
- Print:
  FILE_WRITTEN:<relative-path>
  DIR_STATE:<json-array-of-files-in-target-directory>

End of exported prompt.
