Mission summary: Refactor and modularize reusable code artifacts: utils.py, README.md, generate_artifacts.py, 2025-12-24T02-03-38-947Z_src_refactor_modularize_export_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt, 2025-12-24T02-03-38-947Z_src_refactor_modularize_refactor_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt
Project: generated_script_1766542191957 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/generate_artifacts.py
- Purpose: Implements a runnable CLI that generates and exports refactor/modularization artifacts using shared utilities, including deterministic output paths and optional prompt export.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/refactor_modularize/utils.py: Provides a well-documented, reusable utility module (filesystem, text, JSON, hashing, logging, and small pipeline helpers) extracted and modularized for use across artifact-generation scripts.
- README.md: Documents project purpose, setup, CLI usage, and the refactored module layout for generating/exporting artifacts.
- docs/prompts/2025-12-24T02-03-38-947Z_src_refactor_modularize_export_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt: Stores the exported prompt text used for the export branch as a reference artifact for reproducibility and auditing.
- docs/prompts/2025-12-24T02-03-38-947Z_src_refactor_modularize_refactor_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt: Stores the exported prompt text used for the refactor branch as a reference artifact for reproducibility and auditing.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Implements a runnable CLI that generates and exports refactor/modularization artifacts using shared utilities, including deterministic output paths and optional prompt export.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/generate_artifacts.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/generate_artifacts.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/generate_artifacts.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
