You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create a single CLI entrypoint (e.g., src/run.py) that (1) sets all RNG seeds, (2) runs the canonical pipeline, (3) writes ./outputs/results.json and ./outputs/figure.png with a fixed schema, and (4) writes ./outputs/hashes.json containing SHA256 of each artifact for determinism verification.
Project: single CLI entrypoint (e.g., src/run.py) that (1) sets all RNG seeds, (2) runs the canonical pipeline, (3) writes ./outputs/results.json and ./outputs/figure.png with a fixed schema, and (4) writes ./outputs/hashes.json containing SHA256 of each artifact for determinism verification.

Target file details:
- Path: src/plotting.py
- Purpose: Figure generation routines that produce a deterministic PNG (fixed size, style, and rendering parameters) from pipeline results.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/run.py: Single CLI entrypoint that sets all RNG seeds, runs the canonical pipeline end-to-end, writes outputs/results.json and outputs/figure.png with a fixed schema, and writes outputs/hashes.json containing SHA256 hashes for determinism verification.
- src/pipeline.py: Deterministic canonical pipeline implementation (data generation/loading, computation, and figure creation) invoked by the CLI with a stable artifact contract.
- src/determinism.py: Utilities for setting and validating deterministic behavior (seed setting across libraries, environment flags, and stable serialization helpers).
- src/artifacts.py: Artifact contract utilities defining fixed output paths, JSON schema construction, atomic writes, and SHA256 hashing for each produced artifact.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Figure generation routines that produce a deterministic PNG (fixed size, style, and rendering parameters) from pipeline results.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/plotting.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/plotting.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/plotting.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
