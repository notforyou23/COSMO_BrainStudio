It is a living artifact updated only by the pipeline and intended to keep milestones, deliverables, and CI/CD expectations explicit.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Principles\n\n- **Deterministic generation**: Given the same inputs, the pipeline produces byte-stable artifacts (normalized newlines, stable ordering).\n- **Artifact-first workflow**: Canonical project state is captured under `/outputs/` (docs and structured matrices) before code is expanded.\n- **Small-cycle cadence**: Each cycle adds value while keeping diffs reviewable; changes should remain scoped and testable.\n- **No placeholders**: Roadmap and companion artifacts must be complete statements (no TODO markers).\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Milestones (high level)\n\n1. **M0: Stable structure (Stage 1)** — establish artifact rules and seed required artifacts.\n2. **M1: Deterministic generator** — add a script that regenerates all `/outputs/` docs deterministically.\n3. **M2: CI enforcement** — add CI checks to verify determinism, formatting, and coverage completeness.\n4. **M3: Expansion & maintenance** — enrich matrices, add additional artifacts, and codify update cadence with changelog notes.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Cycles & Deliverables\n\n### Cycle 1 (current): Stage 1 — Seed roadmap\n**Goal**: Create a roadmap artifact that guides subsequent runs.\n**Primary deliverable**: `outputs/roadmap.md`\n**Acceptance**:\n- Captures milestones, cycle plan, and evolution rules for future pipeline runs.\n- Uses stable markdown conventions (headings, bullet lists, consistent terminology).\n- No external references required to interpret the document.\n\n### Cycle 2: Establish `/outputs/` conventions and required companion artifacts\n**Goal**: Ensure every future cycle has a stable structure to build on.\n**Deliverables**:\n- `outputs/README.md` (artifact rules, naming, determinism, update cadence)\n- `outputs/bibliography.md` (curated sources and citation notes)\n- `outputs/coverage_matrix.md` (requirements → files/tests/CI mapping)\n**Acceptance**:\n- Each file is complete and self-describing.\n- Stable ordering and sections; no placeholders.\n\n### Cycle 3: Add deterministic generator script\n**Goal**: Make artifact updates reproducible and reviewable.\n**Deliverables**:\n- `scripts/generate_outputs.py` that regenerates all required artifacts.\n- Optional `scripts/run_pipeline.py` wrapper to run stages in order.\n**Acceptance**:\n- Idempotent: running twice produces no diffs.\n- Writes only under `/outputs/` unless explicitly configured.\n\n### Cycle 4: CI/CD checks and gates\n**Goal**: Prevent drift and ensure artifacts remain authoritative.\n**Deliverables**:\n- CI job to run generator and fail on git diff.\n- Markdown lint/format check (consistent headings, trailing newline).\n- Coverage matrix gate: fails if required rows/columns are missing.\n**Acceptance**:\n- CI is fast and deterministic; failures are actionable.\n\n### Cycle 5+: Expand coverage and governance\n**Goal**: Increase completeness and clarity over time.\n**Potential deliverables** (added only when needed):\n- `outputs/evaluation_cadence.md` (review rhythm, release checklist)\n- `outputs/changelog.md` (artifact changes by cycle)\n- `outputs/risks_and_assumptions.md` (tracked risks, mitigations)\n**Acceptance**:\n- Every new artifact has a clear purpose and an owner process (who updates via pipeline).\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Evolution Plan (how this roadmap changes)\n\n- This file changes only when a cycle is completed or when scope is re-baselined.\n- New cycles should be appended, and completed cycles should be marked with outcomes (kept concise).\n- If acceptance criteria change, document the rationale in the affected cycle section.\n- Keep the roadmap under ~200 lines by summarizing historical cycles into milestones as the project matures.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## CI/CD Expectations (target state)\n\nWhen CI is present, the following checks should exist and remain green:\n- **Generate-and-diff**: run generator; fail if `/outputs/` differs.\n- **Schema/structure checks**: verify required files exist and have required headings.\n- **Coverage checks**: ensure coverage matrix includes all tracked requirements and references to tests/CI steps.\n- **Formatting**: enforce trailing newline and stable markdown style.\"\"\",\n\"\"\"## Definition of Done (for a cycle)\n\nA cycle is considered complete when:\n- Deliverables listed for the cycle exist and are coherent.\n- Changes are deterministic and reproducible.\n- Coverage matrix is updated to reflect the new/changed deliverables.\n- CI expectations (if implemented) are updated accordingly.\"\"\"\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/roadmap.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))",
