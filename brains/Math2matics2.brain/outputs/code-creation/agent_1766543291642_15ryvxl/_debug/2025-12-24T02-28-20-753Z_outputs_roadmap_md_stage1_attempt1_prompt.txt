You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create /outputs/README.md specifying artifact rules/conventions and immediately add the first required pipeline artifacts (roadmap, bibliography docs, coverage matrix) so subsequent cycles build on a stable structure.
Project: /outputs/README.md specifying artifact rules/conventions and immediately add the first required pipeline artifacts (roadmap, bibliography docs, coverage matrix) so subsequent cycles build on a stable structure. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/roadmap.md
- Purpose: Project roadmap artifact capturing milestones, cycles, deliverables, and evolution plan for subsequent pipeline runs.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/generate_outputs.py: Python script that deterministically creates /outputs/README.md and the initial required pipeline artifacts (roadmap, bibliography, coverage matrix) following defined conventions.
- outputs/README.md: Defines artifact rules, naming conventions, determinism guarantees, and update cadence for all files produced under /outputs/.
- outputs/bibliography.md: Curated bibliography artifact listing sources, links, and citation notes used by the project and its agents.
- outputs/coverage_matrix.md: Structured coverage matrix artifact mapping requirements to files, tests, and CI checks to track completeness over time.

Key requirements:
- documentation
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Project roadmap artifact capturing milestones, cycles, deliverables, and evolution plan for subsequent pipeline runs.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/roadmap.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/roadmap.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/roadmap.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
