H2 sections).\n- Avoid embedded timestamps unless explicitly required by the artifact spec (see determinism).\n- Avoid HTML unless necessary for tables not expressible in Markdown.\n\n## 4) Naming & stability conventions\n- Filenames are **lower_snake_case** with `.md` extension.\n- Paths are stable and never include run IDs, dates, or random suffixes.\n- Content should be structured so that diffs are meaningful (append-only logs are discouraged).\n- Tables should be column-stable (no reordering unless the schema changes).\n\n## 5) Determinism guarantees\nPipeline-generated artifacts must be deterministic given:\n- Repository content at a specific commit (scripts + prompts/specs).\n- Explicit, checked-in inputs (e.g., requirement lists) if applicable.\n- The same execution command and Python version range declared by the repo.\n\nTo preserve determinism:\n- Do **not** insert “generated at <timestamp>”, hostnames, usernames, absolute paths, or random seeds.\n- If ordering is required (lists/rows), sort deterministically (lexicographic) unless the artifact defines another stable order.\n- Any computed IDs must be stable (e.g., hash of canonical text) and documented in the producing script.\n\n## 6) Update cadence & responsibility\n- `/outputs/README.md`: changes only when conventions/rules evolve.\n- `roadmap.md`: updated when a new cycle/milestone is added or completed.\n- `bibliography.md`: updated when new sources are introduced or retired.\n- `coverage_matrix.md`: updated when requirements, tests, or CI checks change.\n\nRule: **If a pipeline run changes logic that affects an artifact, that artifact must be updated in the same change.**\n\n## 7) CI/CD expectations\nRecommended checks for `/outputs/` (implemented by the repository’s CI configuration):\n- All required artifacts exist.\n- Files are UTF-8, end with newline, and contain no tab characters.\n- No timestamps/run IDs appear (basic regex guard).\n- Deterministic ordering: verify files are unchanged after a second run (idempotence).\n\n## 8) Generators (source of truth)\nArtifacts in `/outputs/` should be generated by a deterministic script (planned: `scripts/generate_outputs.py`).\nGenerator responsibilities:\n- Create the required files listed in Section 2 with consistent schemas.\n- Be idempotent (running twice produces identical bytes).\n- Fail fast with clear errors when required inputs are missing.\n\n## 9) Compatibility and evolution policy\n- Schema changes must be backwards-aware: update consuming tooling and the coverage matrix together.\n- When renaming or removing an artifact, document the migration in `roadmap.md` and update Section 2 here.\n- Keep artifacts small and reviewable; prefer links to detailed docs over dumping large raw outputs.\n\n## 10) Minimal schemas (normative)\nThis section defines the **minimum** content each required artifact must include.\n\n### `roadmap.md`\nMust include:\n- Current cycle number and goals.\n- List of milestones with acceptance criteria.\n- “Artifact evolution” notes describing expected changes over time.\n\n### `bibliography.md`\nMust include:\n- Sources grouped by category (e.g., standards, tooling, research).\n- For each source: title, author/org, link (if applicable), and usage note.\n\n### `coverage_matrix.md`\nMust include:\n- Requirement identifier, description, mapped artifact(s), mapped test/CI check(s), and status.\n- A deterministic ordering (by requirement identifier).\n\nBy convention, “requirement identifiers” are short stable strings (e.g., `REQ-001`).\"\"\"\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/README.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))\n",
