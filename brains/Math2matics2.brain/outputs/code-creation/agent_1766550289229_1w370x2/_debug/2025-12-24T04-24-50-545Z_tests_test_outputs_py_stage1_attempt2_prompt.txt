You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a single outputs resolver (e.g., OUTPUT_DIR = Path(os.getenv('OUTPUT_DIR', './outputs')).resolve()) used everywhere; add a small helper (ensure_dir, write_json, write_text) and refactor pipeline/experiments/tests to use it exclusively.
Project: generated_script_1766550289461 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_outputs.py
- Purpose: Tests OUTPUT_DIR resolution and the ensure_dir/write_text/write_json helpers including environment variable override behavior.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/outputs.py: Defines a single resolved OUTPUT_DIR and provides ensure_dir, write_text, and write_json helpers for consistent artifact output across the project.
- docs/outputs.md: Documents the unified outputs directory convention, the OUTPUT_DIR environment variable, and recommended usage patterns in pipelines/experiments/tests.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: CI workflow that installs dependencies and runs unit tests to enforce the unified outputs resolver behavior across changes.

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Tests OUTPUT_DIR resolution and the ensure_dir/write_text/write_json helpers including environment variable override behavior.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_outputs.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_outputs.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_outputs.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
