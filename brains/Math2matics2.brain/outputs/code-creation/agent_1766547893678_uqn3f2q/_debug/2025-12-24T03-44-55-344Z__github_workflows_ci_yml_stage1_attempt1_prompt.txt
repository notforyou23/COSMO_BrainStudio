You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement/verify a toy experiment script that always writes `./outputs/results.json` (fixed schema, seeded values) and `./outputs/figure.png` (deterministic plot settings), and call it from `scripts/run_pipeline.py`.
Project: generated_script_1766547893907 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Purpose: CI workflow that installs dependencies, runs the test suite, and verifies the pipeline generates deterministic outputs for continuous integration.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/toy_experiment.py: Implements a deterministic, seed-controlled toy experiment that writes ./outputs/results.json with a fixed schema and ./outputs/figure.png using fully deterministic plotting settings.
- scripts/run_pipeline.py: Pipeline entrypoint that invokes the toy experiment module and ensures the required artifacts are generated under ./outputs with reproducible behavior.
- tests/test_toy_experiment_outputs.py: End-to-end test that runs the toy experiment and asserts results.json schema/seeded values plus figure.png determinism via stable file hash or pixel checks.

Summary judgment
All three branches are complementary per

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: CI workflow that installs dependencies, runs the test suite, and verifies the pipeline generates deterministic outputs for continuous integration.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('.github/workflows/ci.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:.github/workflows/ci.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside .github/workflows/ci.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
