You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Open `src/goal_33_toy_experiment.py`, fix the syntax error, add a minimal `main()` with deterministic seeding, and wire it into `scripts/run_pipeline.py`; then run the pipeline locally and verify artifacts appear in `./outputs/`.
Project: generated_script_1766547793409 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/run_pipeline.py
- Purpose: Wires the goal_33 toy experiment into the existing pipeline entrypoint so it can be executed end-to-end and produce artifacts under ./outputs/.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/goal_33_toy_experiment.py: Implements the goal_33 toy experiment with the syntax error fixed and a minimal deterministic main() that writes artifacts into ./outputs/.

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Wires the goal_33 toy experiment into the existing pipeline entrypoint so it can be executed end-to-end and produce artifacts under ./outputs/.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/run_pipeline.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/run_pipeline.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/run_pipeline.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
