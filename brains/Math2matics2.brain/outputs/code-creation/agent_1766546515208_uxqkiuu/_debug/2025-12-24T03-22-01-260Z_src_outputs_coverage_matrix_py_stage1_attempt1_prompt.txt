You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv with stable ontology columns (domain, subtopic, artifact_type, status, link) and seed rows; create /outputs/eval_loop.md with 5-cycle cadence, metrics, thresholds, and 'what to do next' decision rules.
Project: /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv with stable ontology columns (domain, subtopic, artifact_type, status, link) and seed rows; create /outputs/eval_loop.md with 5-cycle cadence, metrics, thresholds, and 'what to do next' decision rules. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/outputs/coverage_matrix.py
- Purpose: Module defining the stable ontology schema and seed row templates and providing functions to render the coverage matrix to CSV.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/generate_outputs.py: CLI script that deterministically generates outputs/coverage_matrix.csv with stable ontology columns and seed rows and outputs/eval_loop.md with a 5-cycle cadence, metrics, thresholds, and decision rules.
- src/outputs/eval_loop.py: Module that renders the evaluation loop markdown including cycle cadence, required metrics, thresholds, and next-action decision rules.
- src/utils/fs.py: Filesystem utilities for creating output directories and writing files atomically to ensure reproducible artifact generation.
- src/utils/csv_utils.py: CSV helper utilities for stable column ordering, canonical newline handling, and deterministic writing.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Module defining the stable ontology schema and seed row templates and providing functions to render the coverage matrix to CSV.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/outputs/coverage_matrix.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/outputs/coverage_matrix.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/outputs/coverage_matrix.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
