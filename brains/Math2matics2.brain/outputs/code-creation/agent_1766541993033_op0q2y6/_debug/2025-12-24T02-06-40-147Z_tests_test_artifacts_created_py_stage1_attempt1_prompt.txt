You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a minimal runnable computational skeleton that writes deterministic artifacts to /outputs/ (e.g., run_stamp.json + run.log) and add at least 1 pytest test that verifies artifact creation. Audit shows 0 test/execution results and execution previously failed ('No content received...').
Project: generated_script_1766541998530 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_artifacts_created.py
- Purpose: Pytest test that runs the pipeline and asserts that /outputs/run_stamp.json and /outputs/run.log are created with expected structure and content.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/minipipeline/__init__.py: Package initializer that exposes the public run entrypoint for the minimal pipeline.
- src/minipipeline/run.py: Minimal runnable computational skeleton that deterministically writes /outputs/run_stamp.json and /outputs/run.log based on a stable input payload and environment details.
- src/minipipeline/artifacts.py: Artifact helpers for creating the outputs directory, writing canonical JSON, and appending structured log lines in a deterministic manner.
- src/minipipeline/cli.py: Command-line interface that invokes the pipeline run and ensures artifacts are produced with a predictable exit code.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pytest test that runs the pipeline and asserts that /outputs/run_stamp.json and /outputs/run.log are created with expected structure and content.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_artifacts_created.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_artifacts_created.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_artifacts_created.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
