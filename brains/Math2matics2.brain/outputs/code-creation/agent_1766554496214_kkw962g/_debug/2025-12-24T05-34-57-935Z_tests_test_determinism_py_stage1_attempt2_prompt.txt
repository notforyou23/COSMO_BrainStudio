Mission summary: Add a determinism mode to the single entrypoint that runs the pipeline twice with the same fixed seed, writes ./outputs/determinism_report.json with sha256 sums for results.json, run_stamp.json, and logs, and add a pytest that asserts identical checksums across runs.
Project: generated_script_1766554496679 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_determinism.py
- Purpose: Pytest that invokes the single entrypoint determinism mode and asserts that the two runs produce identical sha256 checksums for results.json, run_stamp.json, and logs as recorded in outputs/determinism_report.json.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/entrypoint.py: Single executable entrypoint that runs the pipeline normally or in --determinism mode by executing two runs with the same fixed seed, collecting artifact paths, and delegating checksum reporting to the determinism utilities.
- src/determinism.py: Determinism helpers that run the pipeline twice with a fixed seed, compute sha256 checksums for outputs/results.json, outputs/run_stamp.json, and logs, and write outputs/determinism_report.json in a stable schema for CI verification.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: CI workflow that installs dependencies, runs unit tests including the determinism pytest, and fails the build if determinism checksums differ across the two fixed-seed runs.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pytest that invokes the single entrypoint determinism mode and asserts that the two runs produce identical sha256 checksums for results.json, run_stamp.json, and logs as recorded in outputs/determinism_report.json.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_determinism.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_determinism.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_determinism.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
