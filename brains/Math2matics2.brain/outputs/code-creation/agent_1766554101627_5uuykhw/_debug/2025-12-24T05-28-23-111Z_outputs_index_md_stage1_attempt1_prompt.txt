You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create/verify repo-root ./outputs/ exists and add /outputs/STATUS.md + /outputs/index.md (or manifest.json) that enumerates all current artifacts with exact paths; ensure it includes existing /outputs/README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md and links to new run/test logs once generated.
Project: generated_configuration_1766554101877 (json configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/index.md
- Purpose: Human-friendly index that enumerates all current outputs artifacts (including existing README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md) and provides link targets for run/test logs once generated.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/STATUS.md: Human-readable status dashboard that summarizes the current state of the outputs directory and links to the manifest and key artifacts/logs.
- outputs/manifest.json: Machine-readable inventory enumerating all artifacts under outputs/ with exact relative paths plus metadata fields for type, timestamps, and optional links to run/test logs.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Human-friendly index that enumerates all current outputs artifacts (including existing README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md) and provides link targets for run/test logs once generated.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/index.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/index.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/index.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
