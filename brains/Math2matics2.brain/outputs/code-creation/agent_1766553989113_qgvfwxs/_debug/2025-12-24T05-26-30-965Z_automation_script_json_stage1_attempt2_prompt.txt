You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv with stable ontology columns (domain, subtopic, artifact types, status, cycle target, links) and an initial row set; create /outputs/eval_loop.md specifying per-cycle shipping rules and acceptance criteria; then link both from /outputs/index.md and /outputs/manifest.json.
Project: /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv with stable ontology columns (domain, subtopic, artifact types, status, cycle target, links) and an initial row set; create /outputs/eval_loop.md specifying per-cycle shipping rules and acceptance criteria; then link both from /outputs/index.md and /outputs/manifest.json. (json automation_script)

Target file details:
- Path: automation_script.json
- Purpose: Defines an automation workflow to generate outputs/coverage_matrix.csv, outputs/eval_loop.md, and update outputs/index.md and outputs/manifest.json to link them.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/coverage_matrix.csv: Provides the initial coverage matrix with stable ontology columns (domain, subtopic, artifact_types, status, cycle_target, links) and an initial row set for tracking work across cycles.
- outputs/eval_loop.md: Specifies the per-cycle evaluation and shipping loop with explicit shipping rules and acceptance criteria for each cycle.
- outputs/index.md: Acts as a human-readable outputs landing page that links to the coverage matrix and eval loop documentation.
- outputs/manifest.json: Records a machine-readable manifest of output artifacts including metadata and links to coverage_matrix.csv and eval_loop.md.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines an automation workflow to generate outputs/coverage_matrix.csv, outputs/eval_loop.md, and update outputs/index.md and outputs/manifest.json to link them.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('automation_script.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:automation_script.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside automation_script.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
