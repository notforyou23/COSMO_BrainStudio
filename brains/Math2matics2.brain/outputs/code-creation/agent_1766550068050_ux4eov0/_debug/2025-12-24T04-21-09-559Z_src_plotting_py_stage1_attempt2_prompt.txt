You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define a fixed output contract (e.g., ./outputs/results.json with required keys + ./outputs/figure.png), seed the RNG(s), and add a small deterministic toy experiment (e.g., heavy-tailed mean vs median-of-means) that always writes the same schema.
Project: generated_script_1766550068187 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/plotting.py
- Purpose: Generates a deterministic figure.png (e.g., error distributions/summary bars) using a fixed style and no nondeterministic rendering settings.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/run_toy_experiment.py: CLI script that seeds all RNGs, runs a deterministic heavy-tailed toy experiment comparing sample mean vs median-of-means, and writes outputs/results.json and outputs/figure.png to a fixed schema.
- src/estimators.py: Implements deterministic estimators (sample mean and median-of-means) and supporting utilities used by the toy experiment.
- src/io_contract.py: Defines and validates the fixed results contract (required keys, types, versioning metadata) for outputs/results.json and standardizes output writing.
- requirements.txt: Pins Python dependencies needed to run the experiment and produce the PNG deterministically (e.g., numpy and matplotlib).

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Generates a deterministic figure.png (e.g., error distributions/summary bars) using a fixed style and no nondeterministic rendering settings.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/plotting.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/plotting.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/plotting.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
