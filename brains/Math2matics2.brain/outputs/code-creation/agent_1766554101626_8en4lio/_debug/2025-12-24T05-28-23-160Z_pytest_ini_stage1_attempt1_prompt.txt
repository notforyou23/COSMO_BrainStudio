You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Standardize output path resolution across the codebase: implement a single output-path helper (defaults to ./outputs, optional OUTPUT_DIR env var) and refactor the pipeline/tests to use it exclusively; eliminate any attempts to write to absolute /outputs.
Project: generated_script_1766554101780 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: pytest.ini
- Purpose: Pytest configuration enabling consistent test discovery and output for CI runs.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/output_paths.py: Provides the single authoritative helper for resolving output directories/paths (default ./outputs, override via OUTPUT_DIR env var) and prevents any absolute /outputs usage.
- tests/test_output_paths.py: Unit tests validating OUTPUT_DIR override behavior, default ./outputs resolution, directory creation semantics, and rejection of absolute /outputs targets.
- tests/test_no_absolute_outputs.py: Repository guard test that fails if any tracked source/test code attempts to write to an absolute /outputs path.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: CI workflow that installs dependencies and runs the test suite on push/pull_request to enforce standardized output-path behavior.

Key requirements:

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pytest configuration enabling consistent test discovery and output for CI runs.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('pytest.ini')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:pytest.ini')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside pytest.ini.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
