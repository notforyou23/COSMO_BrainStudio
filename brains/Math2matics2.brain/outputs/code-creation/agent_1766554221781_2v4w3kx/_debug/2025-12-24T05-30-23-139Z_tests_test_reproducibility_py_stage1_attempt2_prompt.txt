You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Extend the pipeline skeleton to generate results.json (fixed schema, seeded RNG) and figure.png (deterministic plotting), then add a test that re-runs twice and compares hashes (or canonicalized JSON) for equality.
Project: generated_script_1766554221975 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_reproducibility.py
- Purpose: Test that runs the pipeline twice in isolated temp directories and asserts equality via canonicalized JSON and file hashes for results.json and figure.png.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/main.py: CLI entrypoint that runs the pipeline with a fixed RNG seed, writes results.json and figure.png deterministically, and supports an explicit output directory argument.
- src/pipeline.py: Deterministic pipeline implementation that generates a fixed-schema results dictionary using a seeded RNG and coordinates saving JSON and plot outputs.
- src/io_utils.py: Utilities for canonical JSON serialization, stable hashing, and atomic file writes to ensure reproducible results.json output across runs.
- src/plotting.py: Deterministic plotting helpers that render figure.png with fixed style, layout, and metadata to ensure byte-stable output where feasible.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Test that runs the pipeline twice in isolated temp directories and asserts equality via canonicalized JSON and file hashes for results.json and figure.png.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_reproducibility.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_reproducibility.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_reproducibility.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
