You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a single entrypoint script (e.g., python scripts/run_pipeline.py) that writes ./outputs/run_stamp.json and ./outputs/run.log deterministically (fixed seed, fixed filenames), add pytest -q test asserting those files exist and match schema/version, and list them in ./outputs/index.md.
Project: generated_script_1766550865077 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/pipeline/stamp_schema.py
- Purpose: Defines the run_stamp.json schema/version fields and validation helpers shared by the script and pytest.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_pipeline.py: Single deterministic entrypoint script that runs the pipeline with a fixed seed and writes outputs/run_stamp.json and outputs/run.log with fixed filenames and schema/versioned metadata.
- src/pipeline/__init__.py: Package initializer exposing the pipeline version constant used by the entrypoint and tests.
- tests/test_run_pipeline_outputs.py: Pytest that executes scripts/run_pipeline.py and asserts outputs/run_stamp.json and outputs/run.log exist and that run_stamp.json matches the expected schema/version deterministically.
- outputs/index.md: Documentation index listing outputs/run_stamp.json and outputs/run.log and describing their purpose and schema/version contract.

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines the run_stamp.json schema/version fields and validation helpers shared by the script and pytest.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/pipeline/stamp_schema.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/pipeline/stamp_schema.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/pipeline/stamp_schema.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
