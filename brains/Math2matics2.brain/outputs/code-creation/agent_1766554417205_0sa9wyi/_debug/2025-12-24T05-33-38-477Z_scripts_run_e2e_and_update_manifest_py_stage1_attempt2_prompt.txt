You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement goal_outputs_bootstrap_20251224_01 by creating ./outputs/README.md (artifact rules + naming + overwrite policy), ./outputs/manifest.json (list of artifacts + schema versions), and at least one end-to-end run that populates results.json/figure.png and updates the manifest.
Project: generated_script_1766554417468 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: scripts/run_e2e_and_update_manifest.py
- Purpose: Runs an end-to-end demo that generates outputs/results.json and outputs/figure.png and then updates outputs/manifest.json accordingly.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/README.md: Documents artifact rules, naming conventions, schema/versioning, and overwrite/retention policy for files under outputs/.
- outputs/manifest.json: Defines the outputs manifest with schema versions and a machine-readable list of generated artifacts and their metadata.
- outputs/results.json: Stores the most recent end-to-end run results in JSON format as referenced by the outputs manifest.
- outputs/figure.png: Stores a generated figure image from the end-to-end run as referenced by the outputs manifest.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Runs an end-to-end demo that generates outputs/results.json and outputs/figure.png and then updates outputs/manifest.json accordingly.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('scripts/run_e2e_and_update_manifest.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:scripts/run_e2e_and_update_manifest.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside scripts/run_e2e_and_update_manifest.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
