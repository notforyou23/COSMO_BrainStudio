You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Resolve integration blockers from earlier validation failures (syntax_error flags reported in several generated modules) by selecting one blessed pipeline implementation, fixing syntax errors in that chosen path, and deleting/ignoring duplicate broken variants; then rerun tests and store ./outputs/test_run.log.
Project: generated_library_1766554417357 (python library)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/test_run.log
- Purpose: Tracked test-run transcript artifact generated/overwritten by scripts/run_tests.py and CI to satisfy the requirement to store outputs/test_run.log.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- pyproject.toml: Project build and tool configuration (Python 3.11+, packaging metadata, pytest settings) to support reproducible local and CI/CD runs.
- src/blessed_pipeline/__init__.py: Package entrypoint exporting the blessed pipeline API as the single supported implementation path.
- src/blessed_pipeline/pipeline.py: Blessed end-to-end pipeline implementation with corrected syntax and a stable public interface used by tests and CLI.
- src/blessed_pipeline/cli.py: Command-line interface to run the blessed pipeline and optionally emit artifacts needed for integration validation.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Tracked test-run transcript artifact generated/overwritten by scripts/run_tests.py and CI to satisfy the requirement to store outputs/test_run.log.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/test_run.log')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/test_run.log')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/test_run.log.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
