You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define and enforce a canonical outputs schema (e.g., outputs/results.json with fixed keys + outputs/figure.png) and add seed control (single RNG seed propagated) in the pipeline entrypoint `python scripts/run_pipeline.py`.
Project: generated_script_1766547793166 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_pipeline_outputs_schema.py
- Purpose: Automated tests that run the pipeline in a temp workspace to assert deterministic behavior under a fixed seed and validate that outputs/results.json and outputs/figure.png are produced and schema-compliant.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_pipeline.py: Pipeline entrypoint updated to accept a single seed, propagate it through all RNGs, enforce writing to a canonical outputs/ layout, and validate outputs/results.json and outputs/figure.png against the fixed schema before exiting.
- src/pipeline/output_schema.py: Defines the canonical results schema (fixed keys/types), provides validation utilities, and implements a single function to write outputs/results.json in a stable, deterministic form.
- src/pipeline/seed_control.py: Implements unified seed control that sets and propagates one RNG seed across Python random, NumPy, and common ML/plotting libraries when available, returning a context object for downstream use.
- src/pipeline/output_paths.py: Centralizes canonical output paths (outputs/results.json, outputs/figure.png, and optional metadata) and ensures directories exist with consistent behavior in local runs and CI.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Automated tests that run the pipeline in a temp workspace to assert deterministic behavior under a fixed seed and validate that outputs/results.json and outputs/figure.png are produced and schema-compliant.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_pipeline_outputs_schema.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_pipeline_outputs_schema.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_pipeline_outputs_schema.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
