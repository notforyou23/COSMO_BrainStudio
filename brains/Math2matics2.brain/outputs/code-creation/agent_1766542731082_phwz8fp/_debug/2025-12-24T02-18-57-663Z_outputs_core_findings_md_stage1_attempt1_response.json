It is intentionally short and action-oriented.\n\n## Current consolidated decisions\n\n### Outputs policy (required per research cycle)\n- **Rule:** every research cycle must add or update **at least one file** in the `outputs/` directory (the “outputs set”).\n- **Purpose:** ensure each cycle leaves an auditable artifact (documentation, results, metrics, or other deliverables), rather than only code changes or ephemeral logs.\n- **Minimum v1 outputs set:** at least:\n  - `outputs/README.md` (index + policy explanation)\n  - `outputs/core_findings.md` (this file; consolidated decisions)\n\n### Portability of `/outputs`\n- The preferred directory is `outputs/` at the project root, but it may be **unwritable** in some environments.\n- The pipeline must therefore implement a **portable fallback** strategy:\n  1. Try the preferred `outputs/` directory.\n  2. If not writable, fall back to a writable alternative (e.g., a project-local temp directory) while still producing an “outputs set”.\n- The enforcement logic should detect the effective writable outputs directory at runtime and report it clearly.\n\n### Enforcement approach (expected implementation shape)\n- At cycle start, snapshot the outputs directory state (file names + mtimes/hashes).\n- At cycle end, validate that at least one file was added or changed compared to the snapshot.\n- If validation fails, the cycle should be marked as failed (or should automatically update a designated output file, e.g., this one) to satisfy policy.\n\n## Cycle update protocol (how this file should change)\nEach research cycle should update **at minimum** one of:\n- this `core_findings.md` with new decisions, resolved questions, or updated enforcement details, or\n- `README.md` with new outputs inventory/policy clarifications, or\n- a cycle-specific artifact (e.g., `cycle_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`, `results.json`, `metrics.csv`) that represents the cycle’s output.\n\nThis ensures a continuous, append-only trail of meaningful progress across cycles.\n\n## Notes from prior reviews (high-level)\n- Prior multi-branch consistency reviews indicated the branches are **largely compatible** with minimal divergence.\n- A key insight to carry forward is the need for **portable outputs handling** (do not assume `/outputs` is writable).\"\"\"\n]\n\nfinal_text = '\\n'.join(block.strip('\\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\\n'\ntarget_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')\n\nprint('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/core_findings.md')\nprint('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path(\"/mnt/data\"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))\n",
