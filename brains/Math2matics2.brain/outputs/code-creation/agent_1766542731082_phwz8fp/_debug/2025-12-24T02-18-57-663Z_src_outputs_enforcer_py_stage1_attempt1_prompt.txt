You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement the 'minimum v1' output set in /outputs/ (at least README.md plus one additional core doc), then enforce a rule: every research cycle adds/updates at least one /outputs file.
Project: generated_script_1766542736630 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/outputs_enforcer.py
- Purpose: Core library module that detects the writable outputs directory, snapshots outputs state, validates per-cycle changes, and provides helpers to create/update required minimum v1 output documents.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_pipeline.py: Entry-point script that runs a research cycle and enforces the policy that at least one file in the outputs directory is added or updated each cycle, with a portable fallback when outputs is unwritable.
- outputs/README.md: Minimum v1 outputs index that explains the outputs policy, lists core documents, and describes how each research cycle updates at least one outputs file.
- outputs/core_findings.md: Core documentation file capturing the current consolidated findings/decisions and serving as a required per-cycle update target for the outputs policy.
- config/outputs_policy.json: Configuration defining the outputs directory preference order, minimum v1 required files, and the per-cycle enforcement rules used by the pipeline script.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Core library module that detects the writable outputs directory, snapshots outputs state, validates per-cycle changes, and provides helpers to create/update required minimum v1 output documents.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/outputs_enforcer.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/outputs_enforcer.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/outputs_enforcer.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
