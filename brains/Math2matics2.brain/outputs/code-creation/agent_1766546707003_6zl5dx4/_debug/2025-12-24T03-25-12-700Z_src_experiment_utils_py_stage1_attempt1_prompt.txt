You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Fix the syntax_error in src/goal_33_toy_experiment.py (flagged as 1 invalid file in the deliverables audit). After fixing, ensure it runs deterministically and writes a seeded results artifact (e.g., /outputs/results.json and /outputs/figure.png) that can be validated by tests.
Project: generated_script_1766546711425 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/experiment_utils.py
- Purpose: Provide small reusable helpers for deterministic seeding, safe output directory creation, and stable JSON artifact writing used by the toy experiment.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/goal_33_toy_experiment.py: Fix the syntax error and provide a deterministic, seed-controlled toy experiment CLI that writes /outputs/results.json and /outputs/figure.png artifacts for test validation.
- tests/test_goal_33_toy_experiment.py: Pytest suite that runs the toy experiment with a fixed seed, asserts artifacts are created, and verifies deterministic results content across repeated runs.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provide small reusable helpers for deterministic seeding, safe output directory creation, and stable JSON artifact writing used by the toy experiment.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/experiment_utils.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/experiment_utils.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/experiment_utils.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
