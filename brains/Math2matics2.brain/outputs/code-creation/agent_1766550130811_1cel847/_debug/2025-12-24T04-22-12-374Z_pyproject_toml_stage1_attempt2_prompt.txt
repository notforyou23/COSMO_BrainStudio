You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define a fixed artifact schema (e.g., outputs/results.json + outputs/figure.png) and enforce determinism via explicit RNG seeding, pinned dependency versions, and consistent naming; add a test asserting exact keys/fields exist and values are within expected tolerances.
Project: generated_script_1766550131070 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: pyproject.toml
- Purpose: Project configuration with pinned dependency versions and test tooling configuration to support reproducible runs.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/run_pipeline.py: CLI-driven deterministic pipeline that seeds RNGs, pins naming, writes outputs/results.json and outputs/figure.png, and validates against a fixed artifact schema.
- src/schema.py: Defines the fixed JSON artifact schema (expected keys/types/required fields) and provides validation helpers used by the pipeline and tests.
- src/plotting.py: Deterministic plotting utilities that generate outputs/figure.png with consistent styling, sizing, and data ordering.
- tests/test_artifacts_contract.py: End-to-end test that runs the pipeline and asserts exact JSON keys/fields exist and that numeric values fall within specified tolerances while ensuring figure.png is created.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Project configuration with pinned dependency versions and test tooling configuration to support reproducible runs.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('pyproject.toml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:pyproject.toml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside pyproject.toml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
