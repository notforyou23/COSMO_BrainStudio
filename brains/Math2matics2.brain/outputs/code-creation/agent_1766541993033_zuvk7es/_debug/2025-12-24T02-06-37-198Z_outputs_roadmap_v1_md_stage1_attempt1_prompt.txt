You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create the first concrete files under /outputs/ (at minimum: /outputs/README.md + one core artifact like /outputs/roadmap_v1.md) and verify they exist in the repo filesystem so the deliverables audit is no longer zero.
Project: the first concrete files under /outputs/ (at minimum: /outputs/README.md + one core artifact like /outputs/roadmap_v1.md) and verify they exist in the repo filesystem so the deliverables audit is no longer zero. (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/roadmap_v1.md
- Purpose: Provides the first concrete roadmap artifact outlining mission goals, deliverables, and next steps for the pipeline in a versioned format.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- outputs/README.md: Documents the purpose of the /outputs directory, what artifacts are generated, and how to validate their presence in the repository.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Provides the first concrete roadmap artifact outlining mission goals, deliverables, and next steps for the pipeline in a versioned format.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/roadmap_v1.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/roadmap_v1.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/roadmap_v1.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
