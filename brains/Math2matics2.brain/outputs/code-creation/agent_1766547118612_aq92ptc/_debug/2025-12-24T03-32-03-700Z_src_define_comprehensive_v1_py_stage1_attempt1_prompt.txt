You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add an explicit 'Comprehensive v1 Definition' section (either in /outputs/roadmap_v1.md or a companion scope file) listing included/excluded subtopics, prioritization rules, and required outputs per subtopic (e.g., 1 theorem + 1 canonical example + 2 sources).
Project: generated_script_1766547122376 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/define_comprehensive_v1.py
- Purpose: Command-line tool that creates or updates a 'Comprehensive v1 Definition' section in outputs/roadmap_v1.md or a companion scope file by generating included/excluded subtopics, prioritization rules, and required outputs per subtopic from structured inputs.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/definition_models.py: Dataclasses and validation logic for the Comprehensive v1 schema including subtopics, inclusion/exclusion flags, prioritization rules, and per-subtopic output requirements.
- src/markdown_section_editor.py: Utility module for idempotently inserting, replacing, and extracting a named markdown section while preserving surrounding content and stable anchors.
- src/sources_ingest.py: Parser for ingesting relevant context snippets and agent review notes into structured evidence used to seed or justify scope decisions in the definition output.
- src/config/comprehensive_v1.schema.json: JSON Schema defining the Comprehensive v1 Definition structure to enable validation of scope configuration files and ensure required fields are present.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Command-line tool that creates or updates a 'Comprehensive v1 Definition' section in outputs/roadmap_v1.md or a companion scope file by generating included/excluded subtopics, prioritization rules, and required outputs per subtopic from structured inputs.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/define_comprehensive_v1.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/define_comprehensive_v1.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/define_comprehensive_v1.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
