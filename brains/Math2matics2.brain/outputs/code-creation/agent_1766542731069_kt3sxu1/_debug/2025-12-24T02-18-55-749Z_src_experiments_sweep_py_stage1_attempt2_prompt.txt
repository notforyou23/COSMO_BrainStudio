Mission summary: Refactor and modularize reusable code artifacts: 2025-12-24T02-11-29-868Z_pyproject_toml_stage1_attempt1_prompt.txt, 2025-12-24T02-11-29-868Z_src_experiments_io_py_stage1_attempt1_prompt.txt, 2025-12-24T02-11-29-868Z_src_experiments_plotting_py_stage1_attempt1_prompt.txt, 2025-12-24T02-11-29-868Z_src_experiments_sweep_py_stage1_export_export_prompt.txt, 2025-12-24T02-11-29-868Z_tests_test_sweep_io_plotting_py_stage1_attempt1_prompt.txt
Project: generated_script_1766542734624 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: src/experiments/sweep.py
- Purpose: Core sweep orchestration code providing a modular API to generate parameter grids, run experiments, collect results, and integrate with I/O and plotting components.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- pyproject.toml: Project configuration defining build system, dependencies, formatting/linting tools, and test runner settings for the refactored experiments modules.
- src/experiments/__init__.py: Package initializer exporting the public API for experiments I/O, sweep execution, and plotting utilities.
- src/experiments/_common.py: Shared reusable helpers and small utilities (validation, path handling, typing helpers) used by I/O, plotting, and sweep modules to avoid duplication.
- src/experiments/io.py: Reusable, well-tested functions for reading/writing sweep inputs and outputs (e.g., configs, results tables, metadata) with consistent schemas and error handling.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Core sweep orchestration code providing a modular API to generate parameter grids, run experiments, collect results, and integrate with I/O and plotting components.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/experiments/sweep.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/experiments/sweep.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/experiments/sweep.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
