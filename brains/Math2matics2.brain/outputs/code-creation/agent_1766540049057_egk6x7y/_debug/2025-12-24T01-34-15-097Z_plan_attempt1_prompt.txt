You are planning a python script implementation for the following mission:
Generate two output artifacts: (1) /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or an equivalent Markdown table) that maps the specified Mathematics domains to detailed subtopics and tracked artifact types, and (2) /outputs/eval_loop.md that defines a 5-cycle review cadence, the metrics to be recorded each cycle (artifact count, cross-links, coverage gaps), and decision rules for what to produce or retire next. Implement the CSV with clear headers and at least one populated example row per domain to establish structure and guidance for further population.

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
Respond with VALID JSON only.
