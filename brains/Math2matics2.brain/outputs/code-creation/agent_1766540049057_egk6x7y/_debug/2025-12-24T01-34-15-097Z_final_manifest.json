Implement the CSV with clear headers and at least one populated example row per domain to establish structure and guidance for further population.",
  "missionSuccessCriteria": [
    "coverage_matrix.csv exists in /outputs and contains columns: Domain, Subtopic, ArtifactType, ArtifactCount, CrossLinks, CoverageStatus, Notes, and at least one populated row for each main domain (algebra, calculus, geometry, probability, statistics, discrete math, modeling).",
    "coverage_matrix is also exportable/presented as a readable Markdown table (coverage_matrix.md) if requested; otherwise CSV should be correctly formatted and machine-readable (commas escaped as needed).",
    "eval_loop.md exists in /outputs and specifies a five-cycle review cadence (cycle length and schedule), defines measurable metrics (artifact count, cross-links, coverage gaps) with how each is computed, and includes decision rules mapping metric thresholds to actions (e.g., create artifacts, prioritize cross-linking, mark as saturated).",
    "All files include clear version/date metadata and an example decision workflow for at least two common scenarios (low-artifact-count gap and high-cross-link shortfall)."
