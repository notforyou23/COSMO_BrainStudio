You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Generate two output artifacts: (1) /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or an equivalent Markdown table) that maps the specified Mathematics domains to detailed subtopics and tracked artifact types, and (2) /outputs/eval_loop.md that defines a 5-cycle review cadence, the metrics to be recorded each cycle (artifact count, cross-links, coverage gaps), and decision rules for what to produce or retire next. Implement the CSV with clear headers and at least one populated example row per domain to establish structure and guidance for further population.
Project: generated_script_1766540053917 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/eval_loop.md
- Purpose: Markdown document defining a 5-cycle review cadence, required metrics per cycle (artifact count, cross-links, coverage gaps), and decision rules for producing or retiring artifacts.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/generate_artifacts.py: Python script that generates outputs/coverage_matrix.csv and outputs/eval_loop.md by defining math domains, subtopics, artifact types, and a 5-cycle evaluation cadence with metrics and decision rules.
- outputs/coverage_matrix.csv: CSV coverage matrix mapping Mathematics domains to detailed subtopics and tracked artifact types with clear headers and at least one example row per domain.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Markdown document defining a 5-cycle review cadence, required metrics per cycle (artifact count, cross-links, coverage gaps), and decision rules for producing or retiring artifacts.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/eval_loop.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/eval_loop.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/eval_loop.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
