You are planning a python library implementation for the following mission:
Implement the three experiments as a single reproducible Jupyter notebook (and companion Python modules) using Python 3.11+ and SymPy: include (A) analytic derivations (SymPy symbolic steps), (B) numeric implementations (NumPy/SciPy), (C) parameter sweep harness, (D) automated unit tests (pytest-compatible), and (E) plotting code. Add save/load hooks to export figures (PNG/SVG) and CSV results.

Explicit requirements:
- tests

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
