You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement a deterministic entrypoint (seed RNGs; avoid time-dependent filenames) that writes /outputs/results.json (fixed keys) and /outputs/figure.png, plus a small metadata block (git hash if available, python version, package versions).
Project: generated_library_1766540970187 (python library)

Target file details:
- Path: pyproject.toml
- Purpose: Defines the Python package metadata, dependencies (e.g., numpy, matplotlib), and console script entrypoint for a deterministic run that writes fixed outputs.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- README.md: Documents how to install and run the deterministic entrypoint, describes the fixed output files and the metadata captured.
- src/deterministic_runner/__init__.py: Exposes the public package API and version information for the deterministic runner library.
- src/deterministic_runner/cli.py: Implements the deterministic command-line entrypoint that seeds RNGs, runs the computation, and writes /outputs/results.json and /outputs/figure.png with stable filenames.
- src/deterministic_runner/determinism.py: Provides utilities to set deterministic behavior across random, numpy, and hash seeds while avoiding time-dependent behavior.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines the Python package metadata, dependencies (e.g., numpy, matplotlib), and console script entrypoint for a deterministic run that writes fixed outputs.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('pyproject.toml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:pyproject.toml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside pyproject.toml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
