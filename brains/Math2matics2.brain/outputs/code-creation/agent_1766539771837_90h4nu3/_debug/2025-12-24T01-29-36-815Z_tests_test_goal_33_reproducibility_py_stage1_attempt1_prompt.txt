You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement goal_33 as the first pipeline milestone: generate a toy experiment (seeded) that writes results.json (summary stats + metadata) and a simple plot to figure.png; add a test that compares a checksum or selected stable fields across runs.
Project: generated_script_1766539775726 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_goal_33_reproducibility.py
- Purpose: Runs the toy experiment twice in isolated temp directories and asserts reproducibility by comparing stable JSON fields and/or a checksum across runs for CI/CD.
- Category: test

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/goal_33_toy_experiment.py: Implements a seeded toy experiment CLI that generates deterministic summary statistics and metadata to results.json and renders a simple plot to figure.png.
- pyproject.toml: Defines Python project metadata and dependencies (e.g., numpy, matplotlib, pytest) and configures test tooling for CI execution.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: CI/CD workflow that installs dependencies and runs pytest to validate deterministic artifact generation on each push and pull request.

Key requirements:
- ci cd

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Runs the toy experiment twice in isolated temp directories and asserts reproducibility by comparing stable JSON fields and/or a checksum across runs for CI/CD.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_goal_33_reproducibility.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_goal_33_reproducibility.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_goal_33_reproducibility.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
