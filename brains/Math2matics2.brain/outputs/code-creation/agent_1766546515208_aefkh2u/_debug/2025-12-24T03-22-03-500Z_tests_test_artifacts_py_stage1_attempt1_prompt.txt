You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Add a pytest (tests/test_artifacts.py) that runs the entrypoint with a fixed seed and asserts created files exist plus validates JSON schema keys (and optionally image hash/size bounds) to detect regressions.
Project: generated_script_1766546521995 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: tests/test_artifacts.py
- Purpose: Pytest end-to-end smoke test that runs the project entrypoint with a fixed seed into a temp output directory, asserts expected artifact files exist, validates required JSON schema keys, and optionally checks image outputs for stable size/hash bounds to catch regressions.
- Category: test

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pytest end-to-end smoke test that runs the project entrypoint with a fixed seed into a temp output directory, asserts expected artifact files exist, validates required JSON schema keys, and optionally checks image outputs for stable size/hash bounds to catch regressions.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tests/test_artifacts.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tests/test_artifacts.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tests/test_artifacts.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
