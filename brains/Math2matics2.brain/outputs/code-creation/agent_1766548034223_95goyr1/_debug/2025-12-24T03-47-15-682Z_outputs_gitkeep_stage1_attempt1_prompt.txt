You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Run the full entrypoint end-to-end locally/CI, capture stdout/stderr to /outputs/run.log, and commit the generated artifacts; add a simple CI command (pytest) to enforce it stays runnable.
Project: generated_script_1766548034507 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/.gitkeep
- Purpose: Placeholder file to ensure the outputs directory is present in the repository for log/artifact generation.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_pipeline.py: Entrypoint runner that executes the full pipeline end-to-end, captures stdout/stderr to outputs/run.log, and writes canonical run artifacts into outputs/ for commit.
- tests/test_pipeline_runnable.py: Pytest that runs the entrypoint locally (lightweight mode) and asserts outputs/run.log and expected artifacts are created and well-formed.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml: GitHub Actions workflow that installs dependencies and runs pytest to enforce the pipeline remains runnable in CI.
- pytest.ini: Pytest configuration to standardize test discovery and output for CI execution.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Placeholder file to ensure the outputs directory is present in the repository for log/artifact generation.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/.gitkeep')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/.gitkeep')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/.gitkeep.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
