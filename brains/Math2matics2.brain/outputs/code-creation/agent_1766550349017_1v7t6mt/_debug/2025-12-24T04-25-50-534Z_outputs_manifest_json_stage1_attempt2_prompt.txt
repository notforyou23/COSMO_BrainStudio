You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Create /outputs/index.md (or manifest.json) that records: command run, inputs, produced files, sha256 checksums for results.json/figure.png/logs; update it after each run.
Project: /outputs/index.md (or manifest.json) that records: command run, inputs, produced files, sha256 checksums for results.json/figure.png/logs; update it after each run. (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/manifest.json
- Purpose: Machine-readable manifest of runs including command, inputs, produced files, and sha256 checksums for key artifacts, maintained by the update_outputs_index script.
- Category: support

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/update_outputs_index.py: CLI utility that appends/updates outputs/index.md (and optional outputs/manifest.json) with the command run, declared inputs, produced files, and sha256 checksums for results.json/figure.png/logs after each run.
- outputs/index.md: Human-readable run ledger that records each pipeline execution (timestamp, command, inputs, outputs, and sha256 checksums) and is updated by the update_outputs_index script.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Machine-readable manifest of runs including command, inputs, produced files, and sha256 checksums for key artifacts, maintained by the update_outputs_index script.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/manifest.json')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/manifest.json')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/manifest.json.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
