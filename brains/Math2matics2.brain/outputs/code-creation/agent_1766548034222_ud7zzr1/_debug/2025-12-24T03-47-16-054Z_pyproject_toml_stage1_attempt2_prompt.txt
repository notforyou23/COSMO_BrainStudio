You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement deterministic generation of results.json (e.g., metrics for mean vs median-of-means) and a corresponding plot saved to figure.png; ensure identical bytes/values across runs given the same seed.
Project: generated_script_1766548034720 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: pyproject.toml
- Purpose: Defines Python project metadata and pinned runtime dependencies (numpy, matplotlib) to support reproducible deterministic output generation.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/generate_results.py: Deterministically generates results.json and figure.png for mean vs median-of-means metrics using a fixed RNG seed and stable serialization/plot settings.
- src/determinism.py: Provides utilities to enforce deterministic behavior across numpy/random/matplotlib and stable JSON/PNG writing for byte-identical outputs.
- src/metrics.py: Implements the mean and median-of-means estimators plus metric calculations in a deterministic, numerically stable manner.
- src/plotting.py: Creates the comparison plot and saves figure.png with deterministic styling, layout, and rendering parameters.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Defines Python project metadata and pinned runtime dependencies (numpy, matplotlib) to support reproducible deterministic output generation.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('pyproject.toml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:pyproject.toml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside pyproject.toml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
