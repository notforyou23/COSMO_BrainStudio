You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Implement the runnable script to produce /outputs/results.json + /outputs/figure.png, then add a lightweight checksum or pixel-hash test (tolerant if needed) to verify stability across runs.
Project: generated_script_1766547587328 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: requirements.txt
- Purpose: Pinned minimal Python dependencies needed to run the pipeline and tests (numpy, matplotlib, pillow, pytest).
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_pipeline.py: Runnable end-to-end script that deterministically generates /outputs/results.json and /outputs/figure.png from a small synthetic experiment with fixed seed and saved metadata for reproducibility.
- src/metrics.py: Utility module providing stable checksum functions for JSON (canonicalized) and a tolerant perceptual/pixel hash for PNG images used to verify output stability across runs.
- tests/test_stability.py: Pytest that runs the pipeline, computes JSON checksum and PNG perceptual hash, and asserts they match stored baselines within tolerance to detect unintended drift across runs.
- tests/baselines/results_checksum.txt: Baseline canonical JSON checksum value expected from scripts/run_pipeline.py for stability verification.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Pinned minimal Python dependencies needed to run the pipeline and tests (numpy, matplotlib, pillow, pytest).
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('requirements.txt')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:requirements.txt')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside requirements.txt.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
