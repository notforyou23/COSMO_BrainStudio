You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Promote/consolidate existing artifacts created under agent-specific directories (e.g., README.md, first_artifact.md, research_template.md) into canonical /outputs/ and add /outputs/index.md linking to all outputs. Audit currently reports 0 documents, implying outputs are not landing where the audit expects.
Project: generated_configuration_1766542056486 (python configuration)

Target file details:
- Path: tools/promote_artifacts.py
- Purpose: CLI script that discovers agent-specific artifact files, copies them into the canonical outputs/ directory with collision-safe naming, and generates/updates outputs/index.md linking to all promoted outputs.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- tools/output_promotion_config.py: Python configuration module defining the default discovery rules (agent directory patterns, file allowlist/denylist, destination naming policy, and index formatting) used by the promotion CLI.
- tools/__init__.py: Package marker enabling reliable imports for the output promotion tooling.
- outputs/index.md: Canonical index of all files in outputs/ with stable Markdown links, initially scaffolded and intended to be regenerated by the promotion tool.
- docs/output_promotion.md: Documentation explaining why audits report 0 documents, how the promotion tool consolidates agent artifacts into outputs/, and how outputs/index.md is generated and maintained.

Key requirements:
- documentation

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: CLI script that discovers agent-specific artifact files, copies them into the canonical outputs/ directory with collision-safe naming, and generates/updates outputs/index.md linking to all promoted outputs.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('tools/promote_artifacts.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:tools/promote_artifacts.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside tools/promote_artifacts.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
