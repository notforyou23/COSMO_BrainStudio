You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Define a standard artifact schema (results.json keys, figure naming, metadata including git commit, seed, timestamps) and add a 'Determinism/Replay' subsection to /outputs/roadmap_v1.md DoD checklist.
Project: generated_script_1766554159345 (json script)

Target file details:
- Path: outputs/roadmap_v1.md
- Purpose: Updates the DoD checklist by adding a new 'Determinism/Replay' subsection describing required artifact schema compliance and replay-critical metadata fields.
- Category: documentation

Other planned files (for context only):
- src/artifacts/schema.py: Defines the standard artifact schema for results.json (required/optional keys), figure naming conventions, and metadata fields including git commit, seed, and timestamps with validation helpers.
- src/artifacts/writer.py: Implements a complete artifact writer that assembles metadata (git commit/dirty state, seed, ISO timestamps), enforces the schema, and writes results.json plus provides helpers for deterministic figure/file naming.
- src/artifacts/git_utils.py: Provides robust utilities for obtaining git commit hash, branch, and dirty status with safe fallbacks for non-git environments.
- src/artifacts/time_utils.py: Provides timestamp utilities (UTC ISO8601) used consistently across artifact metadata for start/end times and creation time.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: Updates the DoD checklist by adding a new 'Determinism/Replay' subsection describing required artifact schema compliance and replay-critical metadata fields.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('outputs/roadmap_v1.md')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:outputs/roadmap_v1.md')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside outputs/roadmap_v1.md.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
