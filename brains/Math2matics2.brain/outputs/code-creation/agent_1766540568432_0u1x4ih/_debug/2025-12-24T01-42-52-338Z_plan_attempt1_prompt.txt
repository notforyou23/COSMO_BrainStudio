You are planning a python script implementation for the following mission:
Generate two output artifacts in the repository: (1) /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or .md table) that enumerates the Mathematics domain, its subtopics, and artifact types with an initial population of cells (coverage status, counts, and cross-link pointers); and (2) /outputs/eval_loop.md defining a 5-cycle review cadence, measurable metrics (artifact count, cross-links, coverage gaps), and explicit decision rules that determine what to produce next. Implement the CSV/MD file in a script-friendly, machine- and human-readable layout and include minimal inline examples and instructions for how future agents should update the matrix and use the eval loop.

Explicit requirements:
- examples

Return ONLY a JSON array (no prose) describing the files you intend to create.
Each item MUST include:
- "path": relative path under the project root (no leading ./ or /)
- "description": single sentence describing the complete file purpose
- "category": one of ["source","test","documentation","config","support"]

Planning rules:
- ONE entry per file - generate complete, functional code in a single pass (GPT-5.2 supports 4000+ output tokens).
- NO multi-stage builds - create the entire file at once with all required functionality.
- Keep the overall plan focused (<= 12 files total) while covering all mission requirements.
- Include tests/docs only when explicitly required.
- Each file should be complete, runnable, and well-documented.

Example format:
[
  {"path": "src/main.py", "description": "Complete main module with API and analytics", "category": "source"},
  {"path": "src/utils.py", "description": "Helper utilities", "category": "source"}
]
Respond with VALID JSON only.
