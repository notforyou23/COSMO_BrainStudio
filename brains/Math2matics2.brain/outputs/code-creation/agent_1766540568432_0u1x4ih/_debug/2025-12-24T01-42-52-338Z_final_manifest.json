  "missionDescription": "Generate two output artifacts in the repository: (1) /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or .md table) that enumerates the Mathematics domain, its subtopics, and artifact types with an initial population of cells (coverage status, counts, and cross-link pointers); and (2) /outputs/eval_loop.md defining a 5-cycle review cadence, measurable metrics (artifact count, cross-links, coverage gaps), and explicit decision rules that determine what to produce next. Implement the CSV/MD file in a script-friendly, machine- and human-readable layout and include minimal inline examples and instructions for how future agents should update the matrix and use the eval loop.",
  "missionSuccessCriteria": [
    "A file exists at /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or /outputs/coverage_matrix.md) with rows for the domain 'Mathematics' broken down into subtopics (algebra, calculus, geometry, probability, statistics, discrete math, modeling) and columns for artifact types (e.g., tutorial, example, problem_set, solution, reference, visualization), with each cell populated by at least a coverage status tag (e.g., none/partial/complete) and a count field.",
    "A file exists at /outputs/eval_loop.md that specifies a 5-cycle review cadence (cycle length and checkpoints), defines the metrics to track (artifact count per cell, number of cross-links per artifact, explicit coverage gaps per subtopic × artifact type), and provides clear decision rules (thresholds and actions) for prioritizing next artifacts.",
    "Both files include concrete examples and instructions: how to add new artifacts, how to update counts and cross-links, and a short validation checklist; files are syntactically correct (CSV parseable or Markdown table renders) and saved in /outputs."
