You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.

Mission summary: Execute `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py`, store logs + exit code + environment snapshot (Python version, pip freeze) under `./outputs/` with a stable naming convention; add a CI/local check to ensure these artifacts are produced.
Project: generated_script_1766547893945 (python script)

Target file details:
- Path: .github/workflows/tests-and-capture-artifacts.yml
- Purpose: GitHub Actions workflow that executes scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py and then enforces artifact creation via scripts/verify_test_artifacts.py while uploading outputs/ as build artifacts.
- Category: config

Other planned files (for context only):
- scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py: Runs the project test command, captures stdout/stderr plus exit code and environment snapshot (Python version and pip freeze), and writes all artifacts to outputs/ using a stable timestamped naming convention.
- scripts/verify_test_artifacts.py: Validates that the expected outputs/ artifacts from the most recent run exist and are non-empty, intended for use as a CI/local enforcement check.
- outputs/.gitkeep: Keeps the outputs directory tracked in git so logs and snapshots have a consistent destination.

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: GitHub Actions workflow that executes scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py and then enforces artifact creation via scripts/verify_test_artifacts.py while uploading outputs/ as build artifacts.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('.github/workflows/tests-and-capture-artifacts.yml')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:.github/workflows/tests-and-capture-artifacts.yml')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside .github/workflows/tests-and-capture-artifacts.yml.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
