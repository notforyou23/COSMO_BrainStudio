## Summary

To verify a borderline-confidence scientific claim, the first step is to precisely define the claim (who/what/compared to what/outcomes/timeframe) so it can be mapped to the right evidence. From there, the recommended approach is to trace the claim to the strongest available synthesis—ideally a recent systematic review or meta-analysis—and, if none exists, to the best available primary studies.

Confidence should then be evaluated using a structured certainty-of-evidence framework such as GRADE, which focuses on risk of bias, consistency across studies, precision of estimates, directness to the target claim, and publication/reporting bias. A practical workflow complements this by quickly checking study design quality, replication, effect size vs uncertainty (confidence intervals), selective reporting vs preregistration/protocols, confounding/alternative explanations, and conflicts of interest. If the body of evidence remains low/very low certainty, the claim should be treated as hypothesis-generating, with clear “what would change my mind” criteria (e.g., preregistered replications or better-controlled designs).

## Key Findings

1. Finding 1: Verification should begin by pinning down the exact claim in a structured way (population, exposure/intervention, comparator, outcome, timeframe) so it can be matched to appropriate evidence.

2. Finding 2: The strongest first stop for substantiation is a recent systematic review/meta-analysis; if unavailable, prioritize the highest-quality primary studies rather than secondary summaries.

3. Finding 3: GRADE is a widely used method to judge certainty of evidence across five domains: risk of bias, consistency, precision, directness/indirectness, and publication/reporting bias (CDC ACIP GRADE guidance).

4. Finding 4: A pragmatic “borderline-claim” checklist includes: confirm study design (RCTs generally higher certainty than observational), look for independent replication, examine effect size and whether confidence intervals cross no-effect, compare outcomes to preregistration/protocols for selective reporting, and stress-test confounding plus conflicts of interest.

5. Finding 5: If evidence remains low certainty after appraisal, the claim should be labeled hypothesis-generating and paired with concrete next evidence to seek (e.g., preregistered replication, improved control, higher-quality synthesis).
