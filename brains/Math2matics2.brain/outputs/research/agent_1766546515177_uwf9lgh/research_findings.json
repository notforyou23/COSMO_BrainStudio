  "summary": "To verify a borderline-confidence scientific claim, the first step is to precisely define the claim (who/what/compared to what/outcomes/timeframe) so it can be mapped to the right evidence. From there, the recommended approach is to trace the claim to the strongest available synthesis—ideally a recent systematic review or meta-analysis—and, if none exists, to the best available primary studies.\n\nConfidence should then be evaluated using a structured certainty-of-evidence framework such as GRADE, which focuses on risk of bias, consistency across studies, precision of estimates, directness to the target claim, and publication/reporting bias. A practical workflow complements this by quickly checking study design quality, replication, effect size vs uncertainty (confidence intervals), selective reporting vs preregistration/protocols, confounding/alternative explanations, and conflicts of interest. If the body of evidence remains low/very low certainty, the claim should be treated as hypothesis-generating, with clear “what would change my mind” criteria (e.g., preregistered replications or better-controlled designs).",
  "successAssessment": "Partially met. The handoff provides a solid, actionable framework (GRADE + a practical verification workflow), which directly builds on the parent agent’s findings and supports decision-making under borderline confidence. However, the work is not fully complete relative to the implied mission of verifying a specific claim because no concrete claim (text/source/domain) was supplied; the next required step is to obtain the exact claim and then perform source tracing (original study, dataset, replications/meta-analyses/critiques) using web search.",
