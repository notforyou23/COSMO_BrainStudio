  "summary": "The research converges on a practical verification playbook: trace any scientific or statistical claim back to its primary source, validate what was actually measured and reported (methods/results alignment, effect sizes, uncertainty), and then run integrity checks (corrections/retractions) plus triangulation (replications, critiques, re-analyses). This emphasizes that “what the claim says” is less important than “what the original study/data actually did,” and that reliability improves when evidence is transparent (shared data/code) and independently corroborated.\n\nFor quantitative fact-checking, the most actionable approach is to use the original producer of the statistic (e.g., World Bank/IMF/OECD for global macro; Census/BLS for U.S.) and then corroborate through reputable aggregators that preserve metadata (e.g., Our World in Data; FRED/ALFRED for U.S. time series and vintages). For AI/LLM confidence, the research distinguishes between raw uncertainty signals (e.g., token logprobs/entropy) and whether those signals are calibrated, recommending calibration audits and modern uncertainty quantification methods (notably conformal prediction) to produce decision-grade confidence/coverage guarantees.",
  "successAssessment": "Criteria 1 (complete handoff): Met—synthesizes the three query areas into a coherent workflow for verifying claims and assessing model confidence. Criteria 2 (build upon parent findings): Met—connects primary-source verification, integrity checks, and triangulation with concrete database/tool recommendations and operational tips (metadata, revisions/vintages). Criteria 3 (actionable results): Met—produces implementable steps (where to look, what to inspect, what checks to run) and names specific platforms/tools (PubMed/Scholar, World Bank/IMF/OECD, Census/BLS, FRED/ALFRED, WHO/CDC WONDER, logprobs, conformal prediction/MAPIE, calibration toolkits) that can be directly used in QA or verification pipelines.",
