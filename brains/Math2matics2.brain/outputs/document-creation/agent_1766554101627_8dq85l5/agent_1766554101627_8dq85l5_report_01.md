### Computational Content Requirements (mandatory per subtopic)
Every subtopic (i.e., each “cell” in the roadmap / coverage plan) must include **all** computational elements below. These requirements come directly from the Sub-goal 3/7 directive to “specify computational content per cell” with (i) SymPy symbolic derivations, (ii) numerical algorithms with solver and convergence criteria, (iii) parameter sweep definitions, and (iv) unit tests + acceptance thresholds.

#### 1) SymPy derivation (mandatory)
Each subtopic must include a **reproducible symbolic derivation in SymPy** that produces the exact objects later used numerically.
Required artifacts per subtopic:
- **Symbol definitions** (SymPy symbols) and any stated assumptions needed for correctness.
- **Derivation steps** (not just final expressions) sufficient to regenerate:
  - governing equations / transforms used in the subtopic,
  - closed-form expressions or reduced forms that feed the numerical method,
  - any Jacobians/gradients or related linearizations when the subtopic uses local linear structure (consistent with the project’s emphasis on derivatives as local linear predictors).
- **Export/hand-off**: explicit statement of what symbolic output is passed to the numerical stage (e.g., lambdified function, simplified expression).

#### 2) Numerical method (mandatory)
Each subtopic must specify at least one **numerical algorithm** and how it is executed.
Required artifacts per subtopic:
- **Algorithm choice** (e.g., “solve X via SciPy solver Y” or an explicitly described iterative scheme).
- **Convergence / stopping criteria** (explicit tolerances and/or max-iteration rules).
- **Stability considerations** when multiplicative updates or extreme scales are involved:
  - If the subtopic involves sequential multiplicative updating, it must use **log-odds** rather than raw odds for numerical stability (per the consistency review note that odds updates can underf

11. [FORK:fork_2] Probability assigns numbers between 0 and 1 to events to quantify uncertainty—interpreted either as long-run frequencies (frequentist) or degrees of belief (Bayesian). Actionable: pick and state your interpretation and any priors up front so your results and assumptions stay clear and reproducible.

12. If n points are i.i.d. uniformly in the unit square, the nearest-neighbor distance R (away from boundary) is approximately Rayleigh with parameter σ = 1/√(2π n), so E[R] ≈ 1/(2√n). Thus typical spacing scales as Θ(n^{-1/2}), shrinking like the inverse square root of the sample size.

13. [AGENT: agent_1766546707002_xq41vse] Across perspectives, “zero progress” is best understood as an end-to-end flow failure rather than a simple component outage: processes can look healthy (pods Ready, low error rates, steady CPU) while throughput flatlines because the system’s *state is not advancing*. The shared diagnostic anchor is the “last successful step” (e.g., last offset commit, last DB status transition, last ack), combined with stage-by-stage flow conservation (ingress vs. egress at API → queue/stream → worker → DB/side-effects) to locate the first point where inflow continues but outflow collapses.

A recurring pattern is *false liveness caused by a choke point in the control plane or coordination layer*, not the workers themselves. Mechanisms designed to protect correctness or stability often fail closed: circuit breakers stuck open, rate-limiters pinned to zero, feature flags/kill-switches accidentally enabled, paused consumer groups, stuck leader election, distributed locks with stale leases, or “safety mode” triggered by noisy alerts. This explains the “silence” signature: low errors, repetitive “no work” logs, constant retries with no side-effects, or stable backlog that never drains.

For emergency recovery, all views converge on prioritizing targeted, reversible interventions over broad restarts or scaling. The fastest low-blast-radius actions are: (1) create a small observable lane for success (canary worker/partition) to prove what still works; (2) quarantine likely blockers (poison-pill messages, hot shard/partition) via skip/DLQ to unblock the rest; (3) reduce thrash by clamping retries and shedding non-critical load; (4) roll back *config/flags* before code and restart only the minimal coordinator/leader component if coordination looks wedged. A key risk theme is that “obvious” moves like scaling up can worsen the stall by increasing contention, rebalances, or pressure on a degraded dependency.

Finally, the perspectives align that many “recent changes” that trigger stalls are not deploys: IAM/credential rotation, certificate expiry, DNS/firewall/policy updates, quotas, broker/DB parameter tweaks, or time skew. When instrumentation is insufficient, rapid evidence collection (consumer lag/offsets, DB lock waits, thread dumps, dependency calls from inside the network, sampled traces) becomes the decisive factor separating quick recovery from prolonged debate.

14. What is one key limitation of using ordinary least squares linear regression on data with heteroscedastic or heavy-tailed errors, and how does that limitation bias parameter estimates and invalidate standard inference (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values)?
