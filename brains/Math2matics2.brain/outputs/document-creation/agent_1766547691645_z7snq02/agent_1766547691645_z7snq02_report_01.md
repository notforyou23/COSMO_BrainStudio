## Mission execution record (grounded in COSMO memory only)

### What the mission requires
1. **Run** `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py`.
2. **Capture** stdout, stderr, and exit code into:  
   - `/outputs/test_run_log_2025-12-24.txt` *(or inside a run_id folder)*.
3. **Write** `/outputs/env.json` containing:
   - Python version
   - OS
   - installed packages

### What COSMO memory actually contains (and what it does not)
COSMO’s available records are **introspection prompts and file manifests** showing what *should be done* and what files were *created by code-creation agents*, but **they do not contain any executed test output, environment details, or proof that the script was run** inside this session.

Concretely:

- Multiple introspection entries (dated **2025-12-24**) describe the intent to:
  - add smoke tests,
  - run `pytest`,
  - and save logs under `/outputs/` (e.g., `/outputs/test.log`, `/outputs/pytest_output.txt`).
  Examples:
  - **2025-12-24T01-20-03-101Z**: mission mentions saving stdout/stderr to `/outputs/test_run_log.txt` and target file `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py`.  
  - **2025-12-24T01-29-38-707Z**: mission mentions running pytest and storing console output in `/outputs/test.log`.
  - **2025-12-24T03-22-01-307Z**: mission mentions generating `/outputs/pytest_output.txt` and `/outputs/run_metadata.json`.

- A concrete file-manifest record shows the script exists:
  - **Agent `agent_1766539771836_cunrzw4`** produced (timestamp **2025-12-24T01:31:06.513Z**) the following files:
    - `scripts/run_pipeline.py` (size 3152)
    - `tests/test_artifacts.py` (size 1657)
    - `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py` (size 1628)

- COSMO memory states the expected environment context for running:
  - Introspection entries explicitly say: **“You are inside the OpenAI code interpreter environment with filesystem access to /mnt/data.”**  
    (e.g., entries at **2025-12-24T01-29-38-707Z**, **2025-12-24T03-22-01-307Z**, etc.)

What is missing from memory (critical to the mission deliverables):
- No captured **stdout/stderr** from actually running `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py`.
- No recorded **exit code** from that run.
- No contents or existence proof for:
  - `/outputs/test_run_log_2025-12-24.txt`
  - `/outputs/env.json`
- No enumerated list of **installed packages** in the runtime.
- No Python version string and no OS identification string captured.

### Why this means the mission cannot be fully completed *from memory alone*
The mission is explicitly an execution-and-artifact task: run a script and write two output files. COSMO memory provides:
- evidence the relevant script and tests were created in one branch (`generated_script` via `agent_1766539771836_cunrzw4`),
- but **no executed run artifacts**, and
- no environment introspection results (Python/OS/packages).

Under the constraint **“Use ONLY the specific facts and findings provided”**, I cannot fabricate:
- a test log,
- an exit code,
- or an environment package list.

So the only accurate, grounded deliverable I can produce here is a **faithful execution gap report** and a **precise run procedure** that matches the file names, paths, and prior mission intent recorded in memory.

## Verified inputs present (per COSMO memory)

### Script expected to be run
- `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py`
  - Confirmed present in agent file manifest:
    - `agent_1766539771836_cunrzw4` @ **2025-12-24T01:31:06.513Z**
    - size: **1628 bytes**

### Related components that tests likely exercise
- `scripts/run_pipeline.py`
  - described in introspection as: writes `/outputs/run_stamp.json` and `/outputs/run.log`
- `tests/test_artifacts.py`
  - described in introspection as: asserts created files exist and validates JSON schema keys

These descriptions appear repeatedly in the **2025-12-24T01-29-38-707Z** introspection entries.

## Required artifacts and their current status (based only on memory)

| Artifact | Required by mission | Evidence in memory it was created/exists | Status we can assert |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `/outputs/test_run_log_2025-12-24.txt` | Yes | None | **Cannot confirm created** |
| `/outputs/env.json` | Yes | None | **Cannot confirm created** |
| `/outputs/test.log` | Mentioned in earlier mission summaries | None | Cannot confirm created |
| `/outputs/pytest_output.txt` | Mentioned in later mission summaries | None | Cannot confirm created |
| `/outputs/run_metadata.json` | Mentioned in later mission summaries | None | Cannot confirm created |
| `/outputs/run_stamp.json` and `/outputs/run.log` | Mentioned in earlier mission summaries | None | Cannot confirm created |

## Exact run procedure (the actionable steps the mission calls for)

The mission’s execution intent is consistent across the 2025-12-24 introspection records: run the test-capture script, and write logs under `/outputs/`.

A procedure aligned to the known paths and environment description (“filesystem access to `/mnt/data`”) would be:

1. Ensure working directory is the project root that contains:
   - `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py`
   - `tests/test_artifacts.py`
   - `scripts/run_pipeline.py`

2. Run:
   - `python scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py`

3. Ensure the script captures:
   - stdout
   - stderr
   - exit code

4. Save captured output to:
   - `/outputs/test_run_log_2025-12-24.txt` *(or a run_id folder)*

5. Write `/outputs/env.json` with:
   - Python version
   - OS
   - installed packages

However, **COSMO memory does not include the resulting files**, so we cannot provide their contents here.

## Conclusion (complete and grounded)

COSMO memory confirms that `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py` exists (created in the `generated_script` branch by **agent_1766539771836_cunrzw4** at **2025-12-24T01:31:06.513Z**, size **1628**), and that the intended workflow includes running pytest and capturing logs to `/outputs/` (as described in multiple **2025-12-24** introspection entries).

But the mission requires **actual execution outputs**—specifically `/outputs/test_run_log_2025-12-24.txt` containing stdout/stderr/exit code and `/outputs/env.json` containing Python/OS/packages—and **no such run artifacts or environment details are present in the provided knowledge**. Under the constraint to use only the supplied facts, I cannot truthfully claim those files were generated or provide their contents.

To fully satisfy the mission, the next necessary step (outside what is available in memory) is to **execute** `python scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py` in the stated runtime environment (with filesystem access to `/mnt/data`) and then verify the existence and contents of `/outputs/test_run_log_2025-12-24.txt` and `/outputs/env.json`.
