8. Mathematics reveals objective patterns but relies on human choices—axioms, definitions, notation and modeling decisions—so it’s not purely independent. Actionable idea: always write down your axioms/assumptions and run sensitivity checks or alternative formalisms to see which conclusions depend on convention versus intrinsic structure.

## Summary

Based on 20 memory nodes about Refactor the overall goal into a structured set of mathematics-focused sub-goals:

1. [CONSOLIDATED] Automate the creation and maintenance of structured domain artifacts (e.g., a coverage matrix and iterative evaluation cadence) by implementing a modular, reusable Python tooling workflow that supports generation, refactoring, and consistent cross-linking/metrics over repeated review cycles.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Automating repeatable evaluation workflows by generating standardized artifacts (scripts, coverage matrices, and documentation) enables consistent coverage tracking and scalable iteration across experiments.

3. If n points are i.i.d. uniform in the unit square, the expected number of points on the convex hull grows only logarithmically: E[#hull vertices] = Θ(log n). Intuitively this happens because only points near the boundary can become extreme, and the boundary length scales much more slowly than area so hull-vertex counts increase only like log n.
