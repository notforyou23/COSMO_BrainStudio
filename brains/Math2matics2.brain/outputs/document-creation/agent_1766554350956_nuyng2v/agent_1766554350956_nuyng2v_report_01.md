### Computational Content Requirements (mandatory per subtopic)
Every subtopic (i.e., each “cell” in the roadmap / coverage plan) must include **all** computational elements below. These requirements come directly from the Sub-goal 3/7 directive to “specify computational content per cell” with (i) SymPy symbolic derivations, (ii) numerical algorithms with solver and convergence criteria, (iii) parameter sweep definitions, and (iv) unit tests + acceptance thresholds.

#### 1) SymPy derivation (mandatory)
Each subtopic must include a **reproducible symbolic derivation in SymPy** that produces the exact objects later used numerically.
Required artifacts per subtopic:
- **Symbol definitions** (SymPy symbols) and any stated assumptions needed for correctness.
- **Derivation steps** (not just final expressions) sufficient to regenerate:
  - governing equations / transforms used in the subtopic,
  - closed-form expressions or reduced forms that feed the numerical method,
  - any Jacobians/gradients or related linearizations when the subtopic uses local linear structure (consistent with the project’s emphasis on derivatives as local linear predictors).
- **Export/hand-off**: explicit statement of what symbolic output is passed to the numerical stage (e.g., lambdified function, simplified expression).

#### 2) Numerical method (mandatory)
Each subtopic must specify at least one **numerical algorithm** and how it is executed.
Required artifacts per subtopic:
- **Algorithm choice** (e.g., “solve X via SciPy solver Y” or an explicitly described iterative scheme).
- **Convergence / stopping criteria** (explicit tolerances and/or max-iteration rules).
- **Stab
