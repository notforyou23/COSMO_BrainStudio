## Summary

Based on 28 memory nodes about Break the overall refactoring goal into a clear set of domain-aligned sub-goals :

1. [CONSOLIDATED] Automate the creation and maintenance of structured domain artifacts (e.g., a coverage matrix and iterative evaluation cadence) by implementing a modular, reusable Python tooling workflow that supports generation, refactoring, and consistent cross-linking/metrics over repeated review cycles.

2. [CONSOLIDATED] Automating repeatable evaluation workflows by generating standardized artifacts (scripts, coverage matrices, and documentation) enables consistent coverage tracking and scalable iteration across experiments.

3. If n points are i.i.d. uniform in the unit square, the expected number of points on the convex hull grows only logarithmically: E[#hull vertices] = Θ(log n). Intuitively this happens because only points near the boundary can become extreme, and the boundary length scales much more slowly than area so hull-vertex counts increase only like log n.

16. [FORK:fork_9] Assuming local linearity can hide unmodeled curvature: if the true relationship has nonlinear structure within the “local” window, ordinary least squares becomes a mis-specified estimator that yields biased predictions and misleading confidence intervals. Remedy by testing for curvature and using basis expansions, interactions, or nonparametric/regularized methods so the model can flexibly capture local nonlinearities.

17. [FORK_RESULT:fork_9] Assuming data are “locally linear” can mask curvature, interactions, heteroskedasticity and outliers, producing biased or inefficient OLS estimates and misleading inference even when global fit looks reasonable. Always validate with residual and leverage plots, local fits or formal nonlinearity tests, and—if violations appear—use basis expansions, interactions, nonparametric/spline or tree-based models and/or regularized/robust estimators to capture the true local structure.

18. [CONSOLIDATED] The common insight is that **the optimal constant in a coercive energy–norm inequality is determined by the operator’s spectral gap**: for functions vanishing on the boundary, the Dirichlet energy (here \( \int_0^1 |f'|^2 \)) controls the \(L^2\)-size ( \( \int_0^1 |f|^2 \) ) with best possible factor given by the **smallest Dirichlet eigenvalue** of the associated Laplacian (here \( \lambda_1=\pi^2 \)), and equality occurs precisely for the **ground-state eigenfunction** (here \( \sin(\pi x) \)).
