  "mission": "Break the overall refactoring goal into a clear set of domain-aligned sub-goals (algebra, calculus, geometry, probability & statistics, discrete math, modeling) and deliverable-type sub-goals (lecture notes, problem sets, solution keys, worked examples, visualizations). For each sub-goal produce a mapping to concrete artifacts: roadmap sections, coverage-matrix rows, and bibliography tags, and specify per-cycle (iteration) targets (scope, acceptance criteria, and measurable progress) for an iterative development cadence.",
