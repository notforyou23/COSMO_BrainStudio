Mission summary: Implement the three experiments as a single reproducible Jupyter notebook (and companion Python modules) using Python 3.11+ and SymPy: include (A) analytic derivations (SymPy symbolic steps), (B) numeric implementations (NumPy/SciPy), (C) parameter sweep harness, (D) automated unit tests (pytest-compatible), and (E) plotting code. Add save/load hooks to export figures (PNG/SVG) and CSV results.
Project: generated_library_1766546122986 (python library)

Target file details:
- Path: src/experiments/numeric.py
- Purpose: NumPy/SciPy implementations for all three experiments including stable numerical evaluation functions, vectorized computation, and reference checks against symbolic forms.
- Category: source

Other planned files (for context only):
- notebooks/experiments.ipynb: Single reproducible Jupyter notebook implementing the three experiments with SymPy analytic derivations, NumPy/SciPy numerics, parameter sweeps, plotting, and save/load hooks for CSV and PNG/SVG outputs.
- src/experiments/__init__.py: Package initializer exposing the public API for analytic, numeric, sweep, plotting, and I/O helpers used by the notebook and tests.
- src/experiments/analytic.py: SymPy-based symbolic derivations and step-by-step analytic helpers for all three experiments with deterministic simplification and LaTeX-friendly outputs.
- src/experiments/sweep.py: Parameter sweep harness that runs grids/lists of parameter configurations reproducibly, aggregates results into pandas DataFrames, and supports deterministic seeding and caching hooks.

Key requirements:
- tests

Stage details:
- Stage: Stage 1
- Mode: create
- Goal: NumPy/SciPy implementations for all three experiments including stable numerical evaluation functions, vectorized computation, and reference checks against symbolic forms.
- Line budget for this stage: <= 150 new/changed lines.

Implementation tasks (execute using Python in this environment):
1. from pathlib import Path
2. import json
3. target_path = Path('/mnt/data').joinpath('src/experiments/numeric.py')
4. target_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
5. Build the entire stage deliverable (<= 150 lines) as a list named chunks where each item is a multiline string representing a contiguous block of code without leading or trailing blank lines.
6. final_text = '\n'.join(block.strip('\n') for block in chunks).strip() + '\n'
7. target_path.write_text(final_text, encoding='utf-8')
8. print('FILE_WRITTEN:src/experiments/numeric.py')
9. print('DIR_STATE:' + json.dumps(sorted(str(p.relative_to(Path("/mnt/data"))) for p in target_path.parent.glob('*') if p.is_file())))

Constraints:
- Ensure the new file fully satisfies the stage goal with no placeholders or TODO markers.
- Keep the newly written code within the stated line/character budget.
- Keep console output short (only FILE_WRITTEN / DIR_STATE plus essential status).
- Do not touch files outside src/experiments/numeric.py.
- After writing the file, provide a one-sentence summary. Do not list the file contents in the final message.
