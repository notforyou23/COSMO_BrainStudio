      "summary": "Summary: all three branches share a common core (objective deduction inside formal systems; human choice in axioms/definitions/models) but emphasize different consequences and emphases. The divergence score (0.88) reflects substantial but resolvable differences in framing and recommended practice.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Deductions are objective and rigorous within a given axiom system: proofs follow from rules once premises are fixed.\n- The choice of axioms, definitions, models and what to formalize is a human, context‑dependent decision.\n- Practical value of mathematics depends on how well a formalism serves purposes (prediction, explanation, manipulation).\n- Because of the human element, one should test robustness of conclusions to changes in assumptions.\n\n2) Conflicting points (or emphases)\n- Branch 3 posits/starts from a “pure objectivity” assumption; Branches 1 and 2 reject treating mathematics as entirely independent. Conflict: whether to treat objectivity as the primary philosophical stance (B3) versus seeing objectivity as conditional or intersubjective (B1/B2).\n- Branch 1 emphasizes creativity, norms, cultural shaping and the role of purposes and values in choosing mathematics; Branch 2 emphasizes embodied/problem-driven selection and an intersubjective fit to the world (predictive/manipulative success). These are more a difference of emphasis than direct contradiction, but can lead to different priorities (normative/cultural vs. pragmatic/empirical).\n- Branch 2 frames mathematical truth in terms of predictive power and manipulability; Branch 1 allows broader normative or aesthetic criteria (elegance, conceptual unification) to play a central role. This can produce tension when a model is elegant but empirically weak, or vice versa.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Adopt the synthesis: treat mathematics as (a) formally objective within specified axioms and rules, and (b) a human‑shaped, purpose‑driven language whose choices must be justified against practical, cultural, and ethical criteria.\n- Operational checklist for practice:\n  1. Explicitly state axioms/definitions/models and the purpose/context for choosing them.\n  2. Justify choices on multiple criteria: internal coherence, empirical fit (if applicable), manipulability/usability, and normative/contextual relevance.\n  3. Run robustness/sensitivity analyses: vary axioms, model choices, parameter values and report how conclusions change.\n  4. Compare alternative formalisms: test predictive performance, computational tractability, and interpretability.\n  5. Document assumptions and limitations for users/stakeholders; iterate with empirical feedback where possible.\n  6. Reflect on non‑technical dimensions (ethical, cultural, intended use) when choices affect people or policy.\n- If forced to prioritize: for empirical applications prioritize predictive/manipulative fit + robustness checks; for foundational/theoretical work explicitly acknowledge normative/interpretive criteria and aim for conceptual clarity and cross‑framework comparisons.\n\nThis synthesis preserves Branch 3’s practical robustness requirement, Branch 2’s emphasis on empirical fit and co‑evolution, and Branch 1’s attention to normative/creative choices."
