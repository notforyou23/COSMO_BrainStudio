      "summary": "Summary judgement: the three branches are largely compatible within a Bayesian framework but emphasize different goals. Branch 1 focuses on decision-quality and sensitivity to priors; Branch 2 frames surprise as an attention/exploration driver; Branch 3 gives a practical conjugate-prior recipe for online belief updates. These can be combined, but there are trade-offs to manage.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All three operate within a Bayesian probability framework: beliefs are encoded as priors and updated to posteriors via likelihoods (Bayes’ theorem).\n- Priors matter: Branch 1’s point that priors can dominate posteriors with only moderate evidence is consistent with Branch 3’s emphasis on explicitly encoding prior strength (α,β).\n- Surprise is prior-dependent: Branch 2’s surprise measure (−log P) is computed from the predictive distribution, which itself follows from the prior and likelihood used in Branch 3—so surprise and Bayesian updating are mathematically compatible.\n- Practical online updating + attention: using conjugate priors (Branch 3) makes it straightforward to compute predictive probabilities and thus surprise signals (Branch 2) in an online system.\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Emphasis vs. action conflict: Branch 1 argues for relying on better priors or much stronger evidence to make decisions, while Branch 2 promotes exploratory attention to surprising (informative) events. That can look like a contradiction when exploration invites evidence that temporarily reduces reliance on priors.\n- Weighting of signals: Branch 2’s curiosity-driven behavior could lead an agent to over-sample low-probability but high-surprise events, which may harm short-term decision quality if priors were reliable (Branch 1). The implicit trade-off is exploration (information gain) vs. exploitation (acting on prior-informed posterior).\n- Modeling simplicity vs. expressiveness: Branch 3’s conjugate-prior recommendation (Beta-Binomial) is computationally convenient but restrictive. If the true data-generating process or the attention policy requires richer likelihoods or hierarchical structure, the conjugate choice may underfit and misestimate surprise or posterior sensitivity (affecting Branches 1 and 2).\n- Interpretation of “moderately unlikely”: Branch 2’s phrase “moderately unlikely events” (high information gain) can be ambiguous relative to Branch 1’s “moderately informative evidence.” Without formal information measures, these notions can lead to different behaviors.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Adopt a unified architecture:\n  - Use conjugate priors where appropriate for online efficiency (Branch 3) and compute posterior and posterior predictive analytically.\n  - Compute surprise as −log p_predict(x) (Branch 2) from the posterior predictive; use expected information gain (KL divergence between posterior and expected posterior) to quantify exploration value.\n  - Use Bayes factors / posterior sensitivity analysis to quantify when priors dominate (Branch 1) and to decide whether to defer to the prior or seek more evidence.\n- Resolve the exploration–exploitation tension:\n  - Implement an explicit trade-off policy: e.g., Thompson sampling or an acquisition function that balances expected utility (exploitation) and expected information gain (exploration). Tune the trade-off by prior strength (α,β) or an exploration temperature.\n- Make priors explicit and adaptive:\n  - Encode prior strength (α,β) transparently and perform prior predictive checks. If prior-dominance is problematic, weaken priors or add hierarchical priors to learn prior hyperparameters from data.\n- If model simplicity is limiting:\n  - Move from simple conjugate forms to structured/hierarchical Bayesian models (or variational/particle filters) when likelihoods are complex or when surprise signals look systematically miscalibrated.\n- Monitoring and diagnostics:\n  - Regularly compute metrics: posterior sensitivity to prior (e.g., vary α,β), average surprise, and realized information gain. Use these to adapt exploration weighting or to revise priors.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Produce concrete formulas and pseudocode for (a) Beta-Binomial online updates + surprise computation, and (b) a Thompson-sampling + info-gain acquisition rule that balances Branch 1 vs Branch 2 objectives."
