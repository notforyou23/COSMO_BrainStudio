      "summary": "Summary judgment\nAll three branches are complementary perspectives on model-building and inference: they stress the importance of (i) what you assume up front (priors / scales / base rates), (ii) which directions in model space matter most (information / curvature), and (iii) simplifying by focusing on dominant effects (nondimensionalization / limits). There are no fundamental contradictions; rather they operate at different but compatible levels (statistical decision, information geometry, physical scaling).\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Prior / scale matters: Branch 1’s emphasis on base rates aligns with Branch 3’s emphasis on choosing characteristic scales to reveal which parameters matter and which are negligible. Both argue you must not treat raw outputs (a positive test, a raw parameter value) as decisive without context.\n- Focus on dominant directions: Branch 2’s identification of high-curvature (high-information) directions matches Branch 3’s dominant-balance idea — both single out the few degrees of freedom that control behavior or inference.\n- Use of reduced representations: Branch 3’s reduced dimensionless groups and Branch 2’s projection onto low-curvature geodesics are both ways to simplify models for faster insight and more stable learning.\n- Decision-driven modelling: All three advocate tailoring modelling/inference methods to the question at hand (e.g., report PPV given prevalence; reduce variables using nondimensional groups; adapt updates to the geometry).\n\n2) Conflicting points / tensions\n- Local vs global perspectives: Branch 2 (Fisher information / local metric) is intrinsically local; Bayes updates and nondimensional limits can be global. Relying solely on local curvature can mislead if the posterior is multi-modal or when large updates cross regions with different curvature.\n- Deterministic scaling vs stochastic geometry: Branch 3’s nondimensionalization treats physical variables and parameter limits, often in deterministic PDE/ODE settings; Branch 2 treats probability distributions and parameter uncertainty. Translating between them requires mapping physical nondimensional groups into probabilistic priors/parameterizations — not automatic.\n- “Follow low-curvature geodesics” vs “focus on high-curvature directions”: phrasing can be misread. Branch 2’s technical point is that high-curvature directions amplify small parameter changes (they're sensitive); you may want to reduce uncertainty there (allocate effort to measure them) but numerical optimization may be more stable if updates follow natural-gradient (geometry-aware) paths which avoid instabilities. So there’s a potential operational tension unless clarified.\n- Prior dominance vs learnability: Branch 1 implies strong priors (or very low base rates) can overwhelm data; Branch 2 implies geometry can amplify small changes where data is informative. If priors are extreme, geometry/learning matters less; conversely, in intermediate regimes geometry and experiment design are crucial. This is a regime-dependence, not a contradiction, but must be made explicit.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Immediate synthesis rule: combine all three systematically — (a) nondimensionalize your physical model to reveal key dimensionless groups and plausible parameter ranges (Branch 3); (b) convert those ranges into informed priors / baseline prevalence estimates for your probabilistic model / tests (Branch 1); (c) compute the Fisher information (or expected information) restricted to the reduced parameter subspace to identify high-information (sensitive) directions and use geometry-aware methods (natural gradient, adaptive experiment design) to reduce uncertainty where it matters (Branch 2).\n- Practical steps:\n  1. Nondimensionalize and produce a ranked list of dimensionless groups with estimated magnitudes and uncertainties.\n  2. Translate those into priors / base-rate estimates for your inference pipeline; report posterior quantities conditional on plausible base-rate scenarios (e.g., PPV vs prevalence curves).\n  3. Compute or approximate the Fisher information on the reduced parameter set; identify high-curvature directions and plan measurements/experiments to reduce uncertainty there.\n  4. Use geometry-aware optimizers for learning (natural gradient / preconditioning) and adaptive experimental design to focus resources on the sensitive parameters.\n  5. Where posteriors are far from local Gaussianity or multimodal, complement local Fisher-based guidance with global checks (sampling, marginal likelihood comparisons).\n- Metrics to monitor: posterior PPV across prevalence scenarios, change in posterior variance along principal-information directions, cost-per-bit-of-uncertainty-reduction for proposed experiments.\n\nIf you want, I can: (A) draft a one-page checklist that maps these steps to your specific model/test and datasets, or (B) take your model equations / test characteristics and produce the nondimensional groups, suggested priors, and a Fisher-information sketch to prioritize experiments. Which do you prefer?"
