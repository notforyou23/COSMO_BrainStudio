    "mission": "Generate two output artifacts in the repository: (1) /outputs/coverage_matrix.csv (or .md table) that enumerates the Mathematics domain, its subtopics, and artifact types with an initial population of cells (coverage status, counts, and cross-link pointers); and (2) /outputs/eval_loop.md defining a 5-cycle review cadence, measurable metrics (artifact count, cross-links, coverage gaps), and explicit decision rules that determine what to produce next. Implement the CSV/MD file in a script-friendly, machine- and human-readable layout and include minimal inline examples and instructions for how future agents should update the matrix and use the eval loop.",
