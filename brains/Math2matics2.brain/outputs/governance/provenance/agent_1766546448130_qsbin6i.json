      "summary": "1) Areas of agreement\n- All three branches treat probabilistic/mathematical conclusions as conditional on information and assumptions rather than absolute facts.\n- Bayes’ theorem is recognized by Branches 1 and 2 as the formal mechanism that reweights beliefs when information changes.\n- Branch 3 complements the others by insisting on explicit assumption-checking and sensitivity analysis to reveal how conclusions depend on those conditions.\n\n2) Conflicting points (or tensions)\n- Emphasis/stance: Branch 1 highlights the epistemic/interpretive point — new evidence can drastically change which hypothesis is most likely. Branch 2 emphasizes a mathematical/algebraic view (Bayes as a change of coordinates). These are compatible in substance but differ in emphasis: Branch 1 stresses volatility of inference, Branch 2 stresses formal transformation properties.\n- Perceived objectivity: Branch 2’s “change of coordinates” language can understate the subjective choices (priors, model form) that Branch 1 and especially Branch 3 treat as consequential. That creates a potential mismatch about how much independence the update rule gives you from modeling choices.\n- Practice vs. philosophy: Branch 3 focuses on diagnostics and robustness in applied work; Branches 1–2 are more conceptual. If the conceptual framing leads one to neglect diagnostics (e.g., treating Bayes as purely algebraic), that conflicts with Branch 3’s practical demands.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions\n- Synthesis statement: Treat probabilistic conclusions as conditional: use Bayes’ theorem as the formal update rule (algebraic viewpoint is useful), but always expose and test the subjective/modeling inputs that determine the outcome. Communicate posteriors and conclusions as contingent on stated priors, likelihoods, and data quality.\n- Practical pipeline to resolve tensions and make inferences robust:\n  1. Explicitly state model, priors, likelihood, and key assumptions (independence, stationarity, distributional form).\n  2. Perform model diagnostics and checks (residuals, posterior predictive checks, goodness-of-fit).\n  3. Run sensitivity/robustness analyses:\n     - Prior sensitivity (alternative priors, prior predictive checks)\n     - Model alternatives (different likelihoods, hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical)\n     - Resampling/robust estimators, permutation tests, bootstrap\n  4. Quantify how new evidence changes rankings/decisions (report Bayes factors, changes in posterior odds, or decision-relevant metrics).\n  5. Communicate results conditionally and transparently: present how conclusions shift under plausible alternatives.\n- Immediate next action: pick a representative inference from the current work, run (a) a prior-sensitivity sweep, (b) a posterior predictive check, and (c) one alternative model. Report how the top-ranked hypothesis and key quantities change — that will concretely reconcile the conceptual (Branches 1–2) and practical (Branch 3) perspectives.\n\nGiven the Divergence Score 0.91, the branches differ mainly in emphasis rather than direct contradiction; the above pipeline will expose and reduce practical divergence."
