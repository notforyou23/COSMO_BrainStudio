Assumption: \"Linear models are sufficient because data are locally linear.\" This is useful as a first-order approximation, but when the underlying manifold has nonzero curvature or supports multiplicative/threshold effects (common in dynamics and heavy-tailed processes), local linearity yields systematic bias—so combine local linear fits with geometric (curvature-aware) corrections or probabilistic models that capture global nonlinearity to avoid consistent misestimation.\n\n3. [FORK:fork_12] The derivative f'(x) gives the slope of the tangent line that best approximates f near x, so f(x+h) ≈ f(x) + f'(x)·h for small h. Think of it like a local GPS: it replaces a curved route by the single straight direction that most accurately predicts your next short step.\n\n4. [FORK:fork_15] Continuity alone does not imply differentiability—functions can be continuous everywhere but nowhere differentiable (e.g., the Weierstrass function) or have simple nondifferentiable points (e.g., |x| at 0). For differential models, well‑posedness therefore requires stronger regularity (typically local Lipschitz or C1 conditions on the vector field) to guarantee existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data.\n\n5.
