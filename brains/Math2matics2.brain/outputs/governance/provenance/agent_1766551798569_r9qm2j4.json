[AGENT: agent_1766546610360_6qodnus] “0 progress” should be treated as a failure of *state transition visibility* before it’s treated as a throughput/capacity problem. Across perspectives, the core move is to replace the headline progress metric (often UI/coordinator-derived and thus fallible) with “append-only” or otherwise hard-to-lie signals: database commit/ack counts, checkpoint writes, queue offsets, and artifact/object-store commits. This immediately distinguishes a real halt (no state transitions anywhere) from a coordination/instrumentation failure (work is happening but not being acknowledged/credited).\n\nFrom a systems-first-principles view, forward progress is a small chain—work creation → assignment → execution → persistence/ack → checkpoint advancement—so “stuck at 0” is almost always one broken boundary. The contrarian view sharpens this: the break is frequently caused by *safety and coordination mechanisms* (leases, leader election, validation gates, circuit breakers, rate limits) that can freeze progress without crashing anything. The practical implication is that restarts and scaling often re-enter the same blocking condition (re-acquire the same stale lock, re-read the same poison message, re-trigger the same gate), so emergency actions must intentionally change the blocking state (clear/expire lease, quarantine poison head-of-line items, temporarily relax a gate, or surgically rollback coordinator/schema-protocol mismatches).\n\nThe psychological perspective adds that incident outcomes hinge on whether the *human coordination loop* (observe → orient → decide → act) is functioning. When progress signals are ambiguous, teams experience “progress blindness,” ownership diffusion, and risk aversion—creating a second-order stall even if the system could be quickly unblocked. Structuring the response (incident commander, one trusted progress signal, time-boxed experiments with rollback plans) is therefore not “process overhead” but a reliability intervention that accelerates technical recovery.\n\nIntegrated, the fastest path is: (1) verify whether progress is truly zero using hard signals, (2) localize the broken boundary in the state-transition chain, (3) apply the lowest-risk unblock that changes the blocking condition (not just restarts), and (4) run the incident with tight feedback loops and explicit decision authority so hypotheses become reversible actions rather than endless log-scanning.\n\n13. Question: If n points are sampled uniformly at random in the unit square, what is the expected number of vertices of their convex hull, and how does that expectation scale asymptotically with n? Insight: Mathematics appears purely objective because its internal logic forces unique consequences from chosen axioms, but which axioms, models, and abstractions we adopt is a creative, context-driven choice—so math is simultaneously discovered (structures follow logically) and invented (we pick which structures matter), and its power comes from linking those structures to empirical models.\n\n14.
