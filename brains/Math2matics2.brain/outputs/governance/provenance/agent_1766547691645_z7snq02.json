COSMO memory provides:\n- evidence the relevant script and tests were created in one branch (`generated_script` via `agent_1766539771836_cunrzw4`),\n- but **no executed run artifacts**, and\n- no environment introspection results (Python/OS/packages).\n\nUnder the constraint **“Use ONLY the specific facts and findings provided”**, I cannot fabricate:\n- a test log,\n- an exit code,\n- or an environment package list.\n\nSo the only accurate, grounded deliverable I can produce here is a **faithful execution gap report** and a **precise run procedure** that matches the file names, paths, and prior mission intent recorded in memory.\n\n---\n\n## Verified inputs present (per COSMO memory)\n\n### Script expected to be run\n- `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py`\n  - Confirmed present in agent file manifest:\n    - `agent_1766539771836_cunrzw4` @ **2025-12-24T01:31:06.513Z**\n    - size: **1628 bytes**\n\n### Related components that tests likely exercise\n- `scripts/run_pipeline.py`\n  - described in introspection as: writes `/outputs/run_stamp.json` and `/outputs/run.log`\n- `tests/test_artifacts.py`\n  - described in introspection as: asserts created files exist and validates JSON schema keys\n\nThese descriptions appear repeatedly in the **2025-12-24T01-29-38-707Z** introspection entries.\n\n---\n\n## Required artifacts and their current status (based only on memory)\n\n| Artifact | Required by mission | Evidence in memory it was created/exists | Status we can assert |\n|---|---:|---:|---|\n| `/outputs/test_run_log_2025-12-24.txt` | Yes | None | **Cannot confirm created** |\n| `/outputs/env.json` | Yes | None | **Cannot confirm created** |\n| `/outputs/test.log` | Mentioned in earlier mission summaries | None | Cannot confirm created |\n| `/outputs/pytest_output.txt` | Mentioned in later mission summaries | None | Cannot confirm created |\n| `/outputs/run_metadata.json` | Mentioned in later mission summaries | None | Cannot confirm created |\n| `/outputs/run_stamp.json` and `/outputs/run.log` | Mentioned in earlier mission summaries | None | Cannot confirm created |\n\n---\n\n## Exact run procedure (the actionable steps the mission calls for)\n\nThe mission’s execution intent is consistent across the 2025-12-24 introspection records: run the test-capture script, and write logs under `/outputs/`.\n\nA procedure aligned to the known paths and environment description (“filesystem access to `/mnt/data`”) would be:\n\n1. Ensure working directory is the project root that contains:\n   - `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py`\n   - `tests/test_artifacts.py`\n   - `scripts/run_pipeline.py`\n\n2. Run:\n   - `python scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py`\n\n3. Ensure the script captures:\n   - stdout\n   - stderr\n   - exit code\n\n4. Save captured output to:\n   - `/outputs/test_run_log_2025-12-24.txt` *(or a run_id folder)*\n\n5. Write `/outputs/env.json` with:\n   - Python version\n   - OS\n   - installed packages\n\nHowever, **COSMO memory does not include the resulting files**, so we cannot provide their contents here.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion (complete and grounded)\n\nCOSMO memory confirms that `scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py` exists (created in the `generated_script` branch by **agent_1766539771836_cunrzw4** at **2025-12-24T01:31:06.513Z**, size **1628**), and that the intended workflow includes running pytest and capturing logs to `/outputs/` (as described in multiple **2025-12-24** introspection entries).\n\nBut the mission requires **actual execution outputs**—specifically `/outputs/test_run_log_2025-12-24.txt` containing stdout/stderr/exit code and `/outputs/env.json` containing Python/OS/packages—and **no such run artifacts or environment details are present in the provided knowledge**. Under the constraint to use only the supplied facts, I cannot truthfully claim those files were generated or provide their contents.\n\nTo fully satisfy the mission, the next necessary step (outside what is available in memory) is to **execute** `python scripts/run_tests_and_capture_log.py` in the stated runtime environment (with filesystem access to `/mnt/data`) and then verify the existence and contents of `/outputs/test_run_log_2025-12-24.txt` and `/outputs/env.json`.",
