The standard contradiction/sign argument plus the Intermediate Value Theorem suffices.\n- Branch 2’s conclusion (after correcting the method) is that the probability equals 1/2. Symmetry and partitioning the square into four Voronoi cells (corner regions) reduce the problem to a simple area computation.\n- The methodological insight in Branch 1 (identify dominant scales and quantify approximation error) is sound as a modeling principle — useful generally even though its specific application to the algebraic question is misplaced.\n\n2) Conflicting points / errors\n- Branch 1 (question + claim) is incorrect about the root count. The cubic f(x) = x^3 − 3x + 1 actually has three real roots, not “exactly one real root in (0,2).” In fact there are two roots in (0,2) (one in (0,1) and one in (1,2)) and one in (−2,−1). So the stated existence/count is wrong.\n- Branch 1 asked to “approximate that root to two decimal pla[ces]” — the question is ambiguous (which root?). Branch 1’s asserted uniqueness in (0,2) is false, so the target is ambiguous.\n- Branch 2’s proposed geometric reduction mention of “disk of radius 1/√2 centered at the center” and suggestion to use polar coordinates is a misleading path. The correct and simpler boundary between points closer to a corner (say (0,0)) and closer to the center (1/2,1/2) inside the corner’s Voronoi cell [0,1/2]^2 is the straight"
