      "summary": "1) Areas of agreement\n- All branches share the same high‑level statistical principle: quantify both effect magnitude and uncertainty rather than relying on p alone. Branches 1 and 3 explicitly advocate reporting point estimates + confidence intervals and setting practical thresholds; Branch 2 emphasizes the need for correct scaling and centering to expose the limiting behavior and uncertainty.\n- All branches implicitly agree that assumptions and correct normalization matter: Branch 1 requires variance assumptions for the pooled t; Branch 2 requires boundary/regularity assumptions for the convex‑hull asymptotics; Branch 3 requires preplanned thresholds and clear definition of what “practically meaningful” means.\n\n2) Conflicting or potentially inconsistent points\n- Domain difference, not substantive conflict: Branch 2 addresses a specific probabilistic asymptotic problem (convex hull area) whose technical scalings and limit theorems are of a different nature than the inference problems in Branches 1–3. This is not a contradiction but a separate topic.\n- Minor imprecision in Branch 2’s summary: the branch states that “rescaling by n^{2/3} exposes a nontrivial limit for the mean deficit and, after a further √· normalization, one often obtains a Gaussian CLT.” That is roughly correct in spirit but could be clarified numerically: typical rigorous results give E[1 − A_n] ~ c n^(−2/3) and Var(A_n) of smaller order, so the proper fluctuation scale for a Gaussian limit is determined by Var(A_n) (commonly leading to an n^{5/6} scaling for the centered variable in many convex‑hull boundary problems). The branch should state exact rates and assumptions (references) rather than informal phrasing.\n- Assumptions for Branch 1: the pooled two‑sample t test and pooled CI require approximate normality of samples (or large n) and equality of population variances; if variances are unequal, Welch’s t (and its CI) should be used instead. Branch 1’s statement didn’t explicitly state the equal‑variance assumption.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis / next actions\n- For applied inference (merge Branches 1 and 3):\n  - Always report the point estimate of interest (difference of means, effect size such as Cohen’s d or log‑odds), a corresponding 95% confidence interval, and the p‑value. Predefine a minimally important/practical threshold (MIE/MCID) and use the CI to decide practical significance (e.g., if the whole CI lies beyond the threshold, conclude practically meaningful).\n  - Use pooled two‑sample t and pooled CI only when equal variances are justifiable; otherwise use Welch’s t. If practical decisions critically depend on small differences, consider equivalence tests or Bayesian interval decision rules.\n  - Document assumptions (normality, independence, variance equality), sample sizes, and how the action threshold was chosen.\n\n- For the convex‑hull asymptotics (Branch 2):\n  - Clarify the exact asymptotic rates and assumptions and cite classic results (e.g., Rényi & Sulanke; work by Groeneboom and others on boundary behavior and Poisson approximation). Typical rigorous statements:\n    - E[1 − A_n] ~ c n^(−2/3) (constant c depends on boundary curvature/geometry).\n    - Var(A_n) is of smaller order; under the usual boundary‑driven regime one finds Var(A_n) ~ v n^(−5/3) (so sd ~ const · n^(−5/6)).\n    - Consequently (A_n − E[A_n]) multiplied by n^{5/6} often converges in distribution to a Gaussian (assuming the applicable regularity and mixing conditions).\n  - If you need a precise CLT or constants, compute them for the exact domain (unit square) and reference rigorous proofs. If your goal is communicating uncertainty for finite n, supplement asymptotics with simulations.\n\nConcise actionable items\n- If you want the pooled two‑sample t test formula and the 95% CI now, use the following (assumes equal population variances):\n  - Pooled variance: s_p^2 = ((n1 − 1)s1^2 + (n2 − 1)s2^2)/(n1 + n2 − 2)\n  - t statistic: t = (x̄1 − x̄2) / (s_p * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2)) with df = n1 + n2 − 2\n  - 95% CI for μ1 − μ2: (x̄1 − x̄2) ± t_{0.975, df} * s_p * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2)\n- If you want, I can:\n  - (a) derive the test/CI for a specific numeric dataset;\n  - (b) provide precise references and a short proof outline for the convex‑hull asymptotics and CLT for A_n;\n  - (c) draft wording and decision rules for preplanned practical thresholds and reporting templates.
