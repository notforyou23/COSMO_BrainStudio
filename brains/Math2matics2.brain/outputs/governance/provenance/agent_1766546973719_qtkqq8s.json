Required sections: Executive Summary, Methods (including notebook run instructions), Experiment 1: Derivative-as-Local-MSE (hypothesis, analytic derivation, numeric results, plots), Experiment 2: Parametrized-Model Unification (hypothesis, implementation, benchmark results), Experiment 3: (third experiment from Computational Plan) (derivation, implementation, results), Cycle-1 Consistency Diagnostics and Reconciliation Plan, Mapping to 7 Success Criteria, Remaining Gaps and Next Steps. Concise 1–2 page summary (approx. 600–1200 words) plus links/paths to full artifacts (notebook, figures, CSVs, tests). The summary must include numeric results (tables or key statistics), plots references, and an explicit mapping of outputs to each of the 7 success criteria.",
