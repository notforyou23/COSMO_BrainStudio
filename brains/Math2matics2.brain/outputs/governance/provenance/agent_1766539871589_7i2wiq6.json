      "summary": "Summary: these three branches share a common reliance on linear structure as a powerful, practical abstraction, but they operate at different levels (local tangent-linear approximations, global spectral modes, and stable numerical computation). The high divergence score (0.96) is justified: there is conceptual alignment but also important limits and methodological tensions to reconcile.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- Linear approximations are central and useful:\n  - Branch 1: local linearization (derivative/tangent) turns nonlinear problems into tractable linear ones locally.\n  - Branch 2: treating network dynamics via linear operators (adjacency or update matrices) produces interpretable modes (eigenvectors).\n  - Branch 3: linear algebraic factorizations (QR, SVD, eigendecomposition) are core tools for reliable computation and model reduction.\n- Spectral decompositions/SVD provide modal descriptions and low-rank structure useful for interpretation and control.\n- Numerical stability matters: avoid forming A^T A where possible; use QR for stable least-squares and SVD for rank-deficient or ill-conditioned problems.\n- Practical workflow: linearize a nonlinear model around a point, analyze the linear operator’s spectrum to predict local behavior, and use stable linear algebra methods to compute solutions and summaries.\n\n2) Conflicting or cautionary points\n- Local vs global validity:\n  - Branch 1 emphasizes strictly local validity of the derivative. Spectral interpretations (Branch 2) often imply global modes or resonances; that is only justified when the system is linear or when you analyze dynamics about a fixed operating point (i.e., after linearization).\n- Applicability of eigenvector “harmonic mode” intuition:\n  - Many social-network matrices are asymmetric or non-normal. Eigenvectors are then not orthogonal and can produce transient growth, sensitivity, or mode-mixing—so the simple harmonic/timbre analogy can be misleading unless you check normality or use singular vectors/pseudospectra.\n- Method vs metaphor:\n  - Branch 2’s signal-processing metaphor is powerful but can overpromise: nonlinear interaction, bounded opinions, and agent heterogeneity violate linear superposition, so spectral control interventions may fail without model checks.\n- Computation vs interpretation:\n  - Branch 3 prescribes QR/SVD for stable computation. Branch 2’s use of eigenvectors for intervention can conflict with the need to use SVD/pseudoinverse when matrices are ill-conditioned or near-rank-deficient; relying on leading eigenvectors alone may give biased or unstable prescriptions.\n- Implicit model assumptions:\n  - Branch 2 assumes dynamics that are well-modeled by linear updates (or at least linearized dynamics). If the true dynamics are strongly nonlinear, local linear modes may not predict long-term or large-amplitude behavior.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Synthesis rule-of-thumb:\n  - Use Branch 1: linearize nonlinear systems around relevant operating points (steady states or trajectories) to get a Jacobian/linear update operator.\n  - Use Branch 2: analyze the spectrum of that linear operator to identify dominant modes, growth/decay rates, and candidate intervention directions — but check matrix properties (symmetry/normality) first.\n  - Use Branch 3: compute decompositions with numerically stable algorithms (thin QR for well-conditioned least-squares, SVD/truncated SVD for ill-conditioned or rank-deficient problems, pseudoinverse or regularization for inference/control).\n- Concrete checklist for applying to a networked dynamical problem:\n  1. Specify the dynamical model (linear or nonlinear). If nonlinear, compute Jacobian at operating point(s).\n  2. Inspect matrix properties: symmetry, normality, sparsity, condition number.\n  3. Choose analysis tool:\n     - If matrix is symmetric/normal: eigen-decomposition gives orthogonal modes.\n     - If non-normal or asymmetric: consider SVD, pseudospectra, and left/right eigenvectors; be cautious with modal interpretation.\n  4. Compute numerically with stable methods: QR for regression; SVD for diagnostics, truncation and regularization; avoid forming A^T A.\n  5. Validate: simulate full (nonlinear) dynamics to test whether linear-mode-based interventions produce desired outcomes.\n- Practical interventions:\n  - If you want to “tune” consensus: use spectral insights to identify influential modes/agents, but design interventions using regularized inverse methods (SVD-based) and test robustness under nonlinear simulations and noise.\n  - If fitting data or solving Ax ≈ b: use thin QR; if near-singular or needing model reduction, use SVD and truncate small singular values; report condition numbers and sensitivity.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Apply this checklist to a concrete network/dynamical model you provide and produce specific eigen/SVD/QR-based recommendations; or\n- Produce a short decision flowchart (one-page) mapping model properties to the recommended computational/analytical method."
