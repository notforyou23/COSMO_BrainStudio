        "content": "Below is a **self-contained coverage matrix (markdown table alternative to `/outputs/coverage_matrix.csv`)** plus a **concise deterministic “read next” rule**. It uses only the facts available in the provided COSMO memory: notably (a) the required stable ontology columns (`domain, subtopic, artifact_type, status, link`), (b) the required math subdomains list, (c) the allowed status taxonomy, and (d) the specific canonical-source-like items actually present in memory (the OLS nonlinearity limitation note; probability interpretation note; probability “beliefs into numbers” note; and the tool stack plan referencing SymPy/NumPy/SciPy/Matplotlib/Seaborn/pytest). No other textbooks/papers are invented.\n\nBecause the memory does **not** contain 3–6 named external sources per subdomain (e.g., no titles/authors beyond internal notes), the matrix associates each subdomain with the **only canonical sources present in memory** and repeats them across subdomains where applicable, while keeping **3 sources per subdomain** (minimum) and marking all as **unread** by default (no evidence of completion status in memory).\n\n---\n\n## Coverage matrix (markdown table)\n\n**Columns match the stable ontology from memory:** `domain, subtopic, artifact_type, status, link`\n\n> Status taxonomy enforced: `{unread, skim, read, notes, verified}`\n\n| domain | subtopic | artifact_type | status | link |\n|---|---|---:|---|---|\n| algebra | core sources | canonical_source | unread | FORK:fork_7 — OLS linearity limitation;

The highest-priority source is `FORK:fork_2`. Step (3) then picks the earliest domain containing it: **probability**.\n\n**Read next =** `(domain=probability, link=FORK:fork_2 — probability interpretations (frequentist vs Bayesian); state priors/assumptions for reproducibility)`\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe matrix above provides the requested mapping from the seven mathematics subdomains to **3 canonical sources each** with statuses constrained to `{unread, skim, read, notes, verified}` and stable columns (`domain, subtopic, artifact_type, status, link`) as specified in COSMO memory. Because COSMO memory does not include external named textbooks/papers per subdomain, the only legitimate sources available are the three internal research items (`FORK:fork_2`, `FORK:fork_7`, and the tool-stack plan), which are used consistently and transparently. The deterministic “read next” rule then selects the next source unambiguously from current statuses, prioritizing reproducibility assumptions (`FORK:fork_2`), then model-diagnostic rigor (`FORK:fork_7`), then tooling reproducibility (tool stack plan).",
