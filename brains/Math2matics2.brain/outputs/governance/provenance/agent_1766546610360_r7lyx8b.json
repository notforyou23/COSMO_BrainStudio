        "approach": "## Computational execution plan (1–3 concrete experiments)\n\n### Assumptions / scope\n- A runnable “skeleton” exists in the repository (e.g., `run.sh`, `Makefile`, `python -m ...`, `main.py`, etc.).\n- `/outputs/` is writable and is the canonical place to store run artifacts and logs.\n- Goal artifacts: **at least one `.json` and one `.png`** produced by a single execution command, plus updated `/outputs/STATUS.md` and `/outputs/index.md` (or `/outputs/manifest.json`) linking to produced files.\n\n---\n\n## Inputs / requirements\n1. **Repository contents** (code, scripts, configs).\n2. **Runtime environment**: Python/Node/R, etc. as required by the skeleton.\n3. **Dependencies** (from `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, etc.).\n4. **Config inputs** (if required): CLI args, environment variables, or small sample dataset.  \n   - If not provided, the plan includes a discovery step to identify defaults and/or bundled sample data.\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 1 — Discover entrypoint + execute skeleton via single command with full logging\n**Purpose:** Find the correct “single command” to run the skeleton, execute it once, and capture all stdout/stderr to `/outputs/run.log`.\n\n### Steps\n1. **Create outputs directory**\n   - Command: `mkdir -p /outputs`\n\n2. **Discover the intended entrypoint**\n   - Inspect for one of the following (in order):\n     - `Makefile` targets: `make -n run`, `make -n all`, `make -n` (list)\n     - `run.sh` / `scripts/run.sh` / `bin/run`\n     - Python entrypoints: `python -m <module>`, `python main.py`, `python src/main.py`\n     - Node entrypoints: `npm run`, `node index.js`\n     - README instructions\n   - Record chosen command as `RUN_CMD`.\n\n3. **Run once, capturing a terminal log**\n   - Execute:\n     - `bash -lc \"$RUN_CMD\" > /outputs/run.log 2>&1`\n   - Capture exit code:\n     - `echo $? > /outputs/exit_code.txt`\n\n### Success criteria\n- Exit code is `0` (preferred) OR non-zero but still produces artifacts (recorded in STATUS).\n- `/outputs/run.log` exists and is non-empty.\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 2 — Validate artifacts (JSON + PNG) and generate a manifest + links\n**Purpose:** Confirm required artifacts exist, and produce a machine-readable index linking to them.\n\n### Steps\n1. **Scan `/outputs` for artifacts**\n   - Minimum checks:\n     - `find /outputs -maxdepth 2 -type f -name \"*.json\"`\n     - `find /outputs -maxdepth 2 -type f -name \"*.png\"`\n   - If none found, fail this experiment and note in `STATUS.md`.\n\n2. **Create `/outputs/manifest.json`**\n   - Contents should include:\n     - `timestamp`\n     - `run_command` (from Experiment 1)\n     - `exit_code`\n     - `log_path` (`/outputs/run.log`)\n     - `artifacts`: array of objects with:\n       - `path` (relative to `/outputs` if possible)\n       - `type` (`json` / `png` / other)\n       - `bytes`\n       - optional: `sha256`\n   - Implementation: a small Python script (or shell + `jq`) that walks `/outputs`.\n\n3. **Create/Update `/outputs/index.md` with links**\n   - Include:\n     - Link to `run.log`\n     - Bullet list of JSON artifacts (linked paths)\n     - Bullet list of PNG artifacts (linked paths)\n     - Link to `manifest.json`\n\n### Success criteria\n- At least **1 JSON** and **1 PNG** are present in `/outputs/`.\n- `/outputs/manifest.json` is valid JSON and lists the produced artifacts.\n- `/outputs/index.md` exists and links to the produced files.\n\n---\n\n## Experiment 3 — Update `/outputs/STATUS.md` with run outcome + reproducibility notes\n**Purpose:** Provide a human-readable status summary for the run.\n\n### Steps\n1. Write `/outputs/STATUS.md` including:\n   - Date/time\n   - `RUN_CMD`\n   - Exit code\n   - Short summary: success/failure\n   - Counts of artifacts:\n     - `N_json`, `N_png`, total files\n   - Pointers:\n     - `/outputs/run.log`\n     - `/outputs/index.md`\n     - `/outputs/manifest.json`\n   - If failures occurred:\n     - Include the last ~50 lines of `run.log` (or a brief error excerpt) and what’s missing.\n\n### Success criteria\n- `/outputs/STATUS.md` exists and clearly states whether the goal was met (JSON+PNG + updated index/manifest).\n\n---\n\n## Outputs that answer the goal (definition of “done”)\n1. **Execution log:** `/outputs/run.log` captured from a single command run.\n2. **Artifacts present:** at least one `.json` and one `.png` in `/outputs/` (or subfolder).\n3. **Artifact linking/indexing:**\n   - `/outputs/index.md` linking to produced JSON/PNG + log  \n   **and/or**\n   - `/outputs/manifest.json` listing artifacts (recommended to do both).\n4. **Status report:** `/outputs/STATUS.md` summarizing the run and pointing to outputs.\n\nIf you share the repository structure (top-level file listing), I can tighten Experiment 1 into an exact `RUN_CMD` rather than a discovery procedure.",
