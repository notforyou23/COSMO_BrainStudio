      "summary": "Summary answer\nAll three branches are largely compatible: the frequentist 1/√n standard‑error rule (Branches 1 and 3) is the same basic scaling that governs posterior concentration in large samples, while Branch 2 supplies the refinement that the constant in that scaling depends on local Fisher information (curvature) and therefore varies by parameter direction. There is no fundamental contradiction, only difference of emphasis and scope.\n\n1) Areas of agreement\n- All branches agree that estimation error shrinks at rate 1/√n (standard error ∝ 1/√n), so variance ∝ 1/n. (Branches 1 and 3 state this explicitly; Branch 2 is consistent asymptotically.)\n- Practically, reducing error by a factor requires increasing sample size by the square of that factor (e.g., halving error → quadrupling n).\n- Reliable inference needs explicit sample‑size planning (pilot estimates of variability or information), not intuition or short runs.\n\n2) Conflicting / potentially misleading points\n- Apparent conflict: Branch 2’s wording (“faster posterior variance decay in high-curvature directions”) might be read as contradicting the universal 1/√n scaling. Clarification: the n‑dependence (1/√n) remains; “faster” means a smaller multiplicative constant (larger Fisher information) so fewer samples are required to reach a given absolute precision in that direction — not a faster power‑law rate.\n- Parameterization dependence: Branch 2’s talk of “curvature” can be misinterpreted. Fisher information (and posterior covariance asymptotics) is coordinate‑dependent unless expressed invariantly; design conclusions should be stated in terms of Fisher information or expected information about the parameter as specified.\n- Small‑sample / prior effects: Branch 2 is primarily asymptotic (local curvature ≈ quadratic log likelihood). With small n or strong priors, posterior behavior can deviate from the simple curvature/1/n picture; Branches 1 and 3 (frequentist SE) likewise are large‑sample approximations.\n\n3) Recommended synthesis and next actions (concise, actionable)\n- Synthesis statement: Use the 1/√n rule for planning but replace the generic σ term by the relevant direction‑specific information: target variance ≈ 1/(n · I(θ)) (or SE ≈ 1/√(n·I)) for the parameter or contrast of interest. Thus sample size formula becomes n ≈ (constant / desired_variance) · 1/I, or equivalently n ≈ (z·σ_eff/ε)² with σ_eff derived from Fisher information or pilot estimates.\n- Practical steps:\n  1. Specify the estimand(s) of interest and parameterization.\n  2. Obtain pilot estimates of variability or compute expected Fisher information under plausible parameter values.\n  3. Compute required n using variance ≈ 1/(n·I) or the usual (z·σ/ε)² formula with σ set to the effective SD for the estimand.\n  4. If targeting multiple directions, design to maximize Fisher information for the most important direction(s) (classical optimal‑design criteria: D‑, A‑, or c‑optimality).\n  5. Check robustness: run simulations with realistic models and priors to capture small‑sample effects and prior influence.\n- Cautions: report the parameterization and information used, and when n is small, rely on simulation or Bayesian updating with explicit priors rather than asymptotic formulas alone.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Convert this into a concrete sample‑size calculator given your estimand and a pilot σ or Fisher information, or\n- Run a small simulation comparing designs that maximize information in different parameter directions."
