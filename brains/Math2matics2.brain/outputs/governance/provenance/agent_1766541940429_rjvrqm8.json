      "summary": "Summary of agreement\n- All three branches agree that mathematical results are deductively objective relative to their chosen axioms/definitions: once the formal framework is fixed, consequences follow objectively.\n- All three also agree that the choice of axioms, definitions, representational formats, and modeling decisions is human-driven and affects what theorems or conclusions are obtained.\n- All recommend (explicitly or implicitly) making those choices visible and assessing how conclusions depend on them (Branch 3 makes this an explicit action).\n- There is a shared view that the usefulness or interpretation of mathematics in the world depends on how frameworks map to empirical or practical goals (Branches 1 and 2 emphasize this; Branch 3’s testing prescription supports it).\n\nKey conflicts and nuances\n- Degree of ontological claim: Branch 2 and Branch 1 treat mathematics as intersubjective (human-shaped but yielding objective internal consequences). Branch 3 begins from a “mathematics is purely objective” assumption and then rejects it as partially false. The main conflict is whether one should start from an ontological stance of independence (Branch 3’s assumption) versus taking intersubjectivity as primary (Branches 1 and 2).\n- Emphasis on empirical fit vs formal autonomy: Branch 2 stresses the role of empirical fit and that math is a flexible language linking abstract structures to the world. Branch 1 emphasizes human goals, culture and practicality shaping what is developed and emphasized, but slightly leans toward math’s internal independence. So Branch 2 is more explicitly pragmatic/empirical in justification; Branch 1 is slightly more descriptive about development and emphasis.\n- Prescription vs description: Branches 1 and 2 are mainly descriptive/philosophical accounts; Branch 3 adds an actionable methodological rule (explicitly list axioms and test by swapping/relaxing one). There’s no real conflict, but Branch 3 is prescriptive about practice while the others leave methodology implicit.\n\nRecommended synthesis and next actions\nSynthesis (concise position)\n- Adopt a pluralist/intermediate stance: mathematics produces objective, deductive consequences inside any fixed formal system, but which systems are chosen, emphasized, and applied is a human, culturally and practically situated decision. Therefore treat mathematical claims as conditionally objective (objective given assumptions) and pragmatically validated when linking to the empirical world.\n\nConcrete next actions (practical checklist)\n1. Make assumptions explicit: for any result used, document the axioms, definitions, modeling choices, loss/metric, and representational conventions.\n2. Perform robustness checks: swap or relax a key assumption (change metric, loss, independence, topology, prior, or geometry) and report how conclusions change. Quantify sensitivity where possible.\n3. Cross-framework comparison: when feasible, derive the result in two different formal frameworks or compare canonical alternatives (e.g., Euclidean vs non‑Euclidean, frequentist vs Bayesian).\n4. Empirical/operational validation: when applying math to the world, test mappings against data or experiments to assess fit and limits.\n5. Communicate conditionality: phrase conclusions to reflect their dependence on assumptions (e.g., “Given A,B,C, we conclude…; if X is changed, then …”).\n6. Institutionalize practice: add assumption-and-robustness sections to reports, code repositories, and peer review checklists; train practitioners in these habits.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Produce a one‑page template checklist you can attach to papers/code for documenting assumptions and robustness tests.\n- Convert the recommended robustness tests into a short protocol tailored to your domain (ML, physics, economics, etc.)."
